Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased with the results we delivered in the first quarter, with adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both exceeding our expectations even with somewhat weaker macroeconomic conditions that drove system-wide RevPAR to the low end of our guidance range. We also continued to deliver on our strong development story during the quarter, expanding our brands into new parts of the world and further strengthening our pipeline, which now includes more than a half a million rooms. Our performance demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and ability to navigate short-term choppiness while driving long-term value for our owners, our guests, team members, and shareholders. Turning to results for the quarter, we reported system-wide RevPAR growth of 2.5% year-over-year, driven by strong momentum from the end of last year that carried into 2025 and supported solid performance in both January and February. However, broader macro uncertainty intensified in March, which pressured demand, particularly across leisure. RevPAR growth was led by group, which increased more than 6% year-over-year, supported by growth in urban markets and continued strength in company meetings. Business transient RevPAR increased 2%, led by solid performance from small and medium-sized businesses, a resilient customer that continues to make up roughly 85% of our business transient mix. Leisure transient RevPAR increased 1% with robust performance in January, followed by softening demand patterns as the quarter progressed, mirroring the uncertainty in the broader macro environment. Weaker trends have continued into the second quarter, with short-term bookings roughly flat year-over-year. We believe travelers are largely in a wait-and-see mode as the rapidly changing macro environment continues to unfold. As a result, and with tougher year-over-year comparisons from the Easter holiday shift, we expect second-quarter RevPAR to be approximately flat versus the prior year quarter. For the full year, our system-wide RevPAR expectations are flat to up 2%, with the midpoint assuming current trends continue. The upside reflects a modest improvement in the second half of the year, and the downside suggests modestly deteriorating conditions. We continue to expect group to outperform transient RevPAR growth. Turning to development, following a record-breaking year of growth in 2024, we had a strong start to 2025. During the quarter, we opened 186 hotels totaling more than 20,000 rooms, representing a 20% year-over-year increase, and achieved net unit growth of 7.2%. Conversions accounted for approximately 40% of openings in the quarter, driven largely by Doubletree and Spark. Additionally, openings in international markets remained strong, representing half of all new additions to our portfolio, including several brand debuts in new markets. Hilton Garden Inn debuted in Greece, Hampton and Canopy entered Africa, and Spark expanded its presence across Europe with openings in Germany and Poland. For the EMEA region overall, we're excited to mark the opening of our one-thousandth hotel this spring. Our luxury and lifestyle category continues to show significant growth, accounting for 30% of all hotel openings in the quarter, with these portfolios now approaching 1,000 hotels around the world. The addition of SLH properties and continued growth of our conversion-friendly Curio and Tapestry brands supported growth across both categories during the quarter. Momentum continued into April with several key openings, including the Waldorf Astoria Osaka, a 252-room property that offers panoramic skyline views and successfully blends the iconic Waldorf Astoria legacy with the dynamic energy of Osaka. Additionally, just last week, we opened the new Waldorf Astoria Costa Rica. The hotel has stunning views of Costa Rica's Northern Pacific Coast, 10,000 square feet of versatile meeting space, and six regionally inspired dining experiences. Our latest Waldorf Astoria will pair world-class luxury with the nature and vibrant culture of Costa Rica while further expanding Hilton's growing luxury portfolio, which is now one of the largest in the industry. In addition to strong openings, we continue to grow our development pipeline, which ended the quarter with more than 503,000 rooms, representing an increase of 7% year-over-year and continued sequential quarterly growth. We approved more than 32,000 rooms in the quarter, up 10% year-over-year, with notable announcements including new Signia hotels in Jaipur, India, and Cairo, Egypt, marking the debut of this brand in the Asia Pacific and Africa regions. Additionally, we signed our first Waldorf Astoria in Texas, and in April, we announced the signing of Waldorf Astoria Turks and Caicos, which will redefine Caribbean luxury when it opens in 2028. We also approved the first Tapestry and Curio Hotels in Athens, Greece, signed canopies for ski destinations in Deer Valley, Utah, and announced plans for Tempo to enter the UK, marking the brand's first hotel outside the US. To capture even more fast-growing global middle-class demand, we continued to strengthen our focused service pipeline in strategic growth markets. During the quarter, we approved Hilton Garden properties in Vietnam, Malaysia, The Philippines, and Indonesia, and announced that we will triple our focused service footprint in Southeast Asia in the coming years, fueled by the growing demand for mid-market accommodations. In India, we signed a strategic licensing agreement with Nile Hospitality to open 75 Hampton hotels in the market. Along with our agreement to open 50 Spark hotels in India, this reaffirms our commitment to expanding in this key emerging economy. Construction starts remained strong in the first quarter, up 13% year-over-year, excluding partnerships, with growth across all regions, in particular strength in Asia Pacific. Our pipeline includes nearly a quarter million rooms under construction, which is more than any other hotel company, representing more than 20% of industry share of rooms under construction and nearly four times our existing share of supply. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver net unit growth of 6% to 7% in 2025, with nearly half of our pipeline under construction and continued growth in conversion opportunities. Making all this possible is our family of Hilton team members who continue to spread the light and warmth of hospitality in remarkable ways. During the quarter, we were named the number one best company to work for in the United States by Great Place to Work and Fortune, marking our second consecutive year in the number one spot and our tenth appearance on this prestigious list. Overall, we're pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remain optimistic about our opportunities over the long term. Supported by our asset-light, fee-based business model and favorable megatrends in travel, we believe we can continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders despite current uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter and our expectations for the rest of the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, driven largely by rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $795 million in the first quarter, up 6% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was largely driven by better-than-expected growth in non-RevPAR-driven fees and timing items. Management and franchise fees grew 5% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.72. Turning to our regional performance, first-quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR increased 2.1%, driven by strong group performance. For full-year 2025, we expect U.S. RevPAR growth to be around the midpoint of our revised system-wide RevPAR range. In The Americas outside the U.S., first-quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year, driven by key events in Mexico and Brazil, including Carnival. For full-year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth to be in the mid-single digits. In Europe, RevPAR grew 2.6% year-over-year, with strong rate and occupancy growth in Continental Europe driving results for the region. For full-year 2025, we expect low single-digit RevPAR growth. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 8.5% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in Saudi Arabia during Ramadan and key regional events, including the Muslim World League Conference. For full-year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid-single-digit range. In the Asia Pacific region, first-quarter RevPAR was flat year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 3.5%, led by strong performance in Japan, India, and Korea. China RevPAR declined 3.1% in the quarter as performance was pressured by strong outbound travel during Chinese New Year and tough year-over-year comparisons. For full-year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth in Asia Pacific to be in the low single-digit range, assuming flat RevPAR in China. Turning to development, as Chris mentioned, for the quarter, we grew net unit 7.2% and have more than 503,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 7% year-over-year, with more than half located outside the U.S. and nearly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we remain optimistic in our development story in both the U.S. and international markets, with continued strength in conversions, as well as high-growth international markets. Moving to guidance, for the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $940 million and $960 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.97 and $2.02. For full-year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth of zero to 2%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.65 billion and $3.71 billion and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $7.76 and $7.94. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter, for a total of $37 million in dividends for the year. In the second quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our first quarter and full-year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Nick, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: And your first question today will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris, Kevin. Thank you for taking my question. Good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Carlo Santarelli: So you guys have obviously, not to date anyone, but you've been through some cycles in the past over your careers in the business. And I guess my question is, based on what you're seeing, whether at the hotel level within the business, developers you're speaking to, or kind of in the news in DC, what is your perception of the much-feared and often talked about recessionary environment? What are some of the things you guys are seeing right now, specifically outside of kind of near-term demand and stuff that gives you some pause or reminds you of a prior time?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I think Carlo, thanks for the question. That's probably the question on everybody's mind. My guess is we're gonna get that question 30 iterations of that question today. But hopefully, I'll do a job of answering it. I have lived through a lot of cycles. I've been doing this for a long time. Approaching forty years. So we've lived through a lot of good times, lots of not so good times, and, you know, seeing lots of black swan events, you know, normal recessionary downturns and the like. And they're all sort of unique. I think what is going on today, you lift way above it, and again, I'm not trying to be a polyester. You asked me a question. I'm giving you my personal opinion. Which may or may not be right in the end. You good news is you'll get to judge me, you know, as every quarter plays out, but Right now, there's just so much going on, I live in DC. I live inside the Beltway, I'm talking to a lot of people on the hill and in the administration you know, to get a you know, as best I can a sense of what's going on. And I think it's fair to say there is a lot going on. And as a result, you it in the market reaction across both the equity markets, the bond markets and everything else. Consumer sentiment. There's just a fair amount of uncertainty. I would say based on lots of discussions and years of experience doing this that I think at the moment, did the risk in the marketplace is weighted too heavily to the downside. If I look at what's going on in our business, certainly, we have seen a modest step back in demand patterns, the moment, those seem to be relatively stable, which is why we gave the guidance and sort of suggested what we did at the midpoint, which is sort of what the midpoint is an expectation of things that the patterns we're seeing right now continue. I think, you know, there's a lot of seismic change that this, you know, administration here in The United States is trying to accomplish. You can't have you know, move that much cheese, so to speak, without rattling a lot of cages. That doesn't mean it necessarily you know, doesn't end up in a good place. My own view is when in the process of doing it, though, again, I think I think the market is sort of asymmetrically risk via take the risk of downside. I think it's a much more equally weighted risk. I'm an optimist by nature, so I'll fully declare. I would actually say I think the risk over intermediate to longer term is probably should be more weighted on the upside, but, you know, but let's just say, I think, you know, to be conservative, it's a much more equally weighted risk than what everybody is thinking and talking about today. Why do I think that? Again, I could be wrong, but I think if you really lift up and look at what's going on, you have you know, real progress being made. It's choppy, and it's there's a lot of noise, but, you know, the legislative process is grinding through. I think there is a very good probability that sometime this summer, you're going to see one big bill get done that's going to deal with a lot of the regulatory reform, energy, releasing the shackles from the energy industry, and for making permanent, you know, the 2017 tax cuts and also incrementally adding for certain folks, you know, no tax on tips, Social Security, you know, for the elderly, and a whole bunch of other things that are gonna be positive. I think there's a reasonable probability all that gets done. Obviously, what's rattled the markets, and I'm not an economist, so I can pontificate, and you guys on the call can judge for yourself. Know, what you know, there's lots of ways of doing things. This is the way they've chosen to do it. I think the desire is to ultimately end up with a fair deal with our biggest trading partners around the world. My own belief is that as the next as you're getting the legislative process done on, you know, the on the tax and regulatory and energy, you're going to see a bunch of these deals with some of our biggest trading partners come to fruition. Which is going to create maybe not perfect stability, a lot more stability, a lot more certainty of what the deals look like, what the future is. And I think that's not it's not crazy to think that all that starts to come together this summer. As a result, when you get to the second half of the year, you could be in a very different place. If you look underneath it all in terms of, like, what's really going on in employment, wage growth, and corporate America's balance sheet and profit, all of the underlying economy is still really strong. What's going on right now is this asymmetrical risk to the downside because of a high degree of uncertainty. My own belief is you will see some of that if not a lot of that uncertainty wane over the next couple of quarters. And that will allow the underlying strength of the economy to shine through again. That's why I know a lot of companies have not pulled guidance, and I'm not being critical when we talked about it, my view was very simple. We know more about our business than anybody else. I hope we do. And think we do. And I feel like we have an obligation even in uncertain times to give you a sense of the various outcomes that we think based on assumptions, which is why we gave you a range of zero to two and gave you the basis of assumptions. I believe that we've tried to be as scientific as we can. I feel very good about how we thought that. And the good news is we report every quarter, and we'll have next time we report, we'll have a quarter behind us, we'll have much better sight lines into how the second half of the year is developing. And we'll update you. But that's a long-winded way of saying having been around doing this a long time, anytime you have seismic change, I don't care what it is, like, whether it's black swan events of, nine eleven or the great recession, or COVID, obviously, is nothing like any of those, there's a reaction. My own experience says there's an overreaction. Right now, there's a lot of uncertainty. Think there's a bit of an overreaction to it, Again, I would say sort of reasonably conservatively, I think that it should be much more equally weighted than what we're experiencing today.
Carlo Santarelli: Thanks, Chris. I appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Good morning everyone. Ahead.
Chris Nassetta: Chris or Kevin, wondering if we could just talk about the development environment a little bit. We get a lot of questions about sort of how the uncertainty today is going to filter through the development landscape, particularly around trade and tariffs. So could you sort of elaborate on sort of the comments that you saw or the trajectory that you saw during the quarter? How specifically is that factoring in the way developers are proceeding with current projects? Thinking about possibly delaying, you know, things like signings, moving into in construction, Just what's the behavior out there on the development side? And what is the risk, if any, to sort of the way you see NUG shaping up for the year? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, don't give guidance lightly, as I just tried to suggest in the same, you know, whether it's on same store or unit growth. We spend Shaun, as I'm sure you know and others on the call know, we don't just make it up. It's super granular analysis. And when we give guidance, it's because we feel really good about it. I mean, the fact is for this year, while we still have a lot of work to do, as always, to our development teams, thank you for that work. And we still have in the year for the year conversions. You could see in the first quarter, we have huge amount of momentum on conversions. The things that are under new under development and new construction, those are in those are in process. If they're gonna deliver this year, they're not you know, largely getting close to being done. You know? So know, we feel very good about our ability to deliver within those ranges. By the way, starting to look at next year, again, we have a pipeline of over a half a million rooms, half of that under construction, you know, got a lot of momentum on conversions, we feel good about being able to do it again next year. I know you didn't ask that. In terms of what's going on real time sort of relates to my first answer a little bit. I mean, not much. I mean, if you look at the quarter, okay, the data suggests everything looks great. Your signings are up, your starts are up, deliveries are up on a year-over-year basis. All that is I think all that is fine. I think all of those things even as we forecast the full year, are going to remain positive. I think being objective, we talk to owners all the time, a lot of we've know all of our owners and many of them are very close friends. Mean, not unlike we've seen a little bit with customers, everybody's kinda like, you know, stepping back a little bit and saying, I just want you know, like, understand where the world is going. But So far, we haven't seen any real any real impact. Remember, it's not that we couldn't, and if this persists, if I'm wrong, and the uncertainty at this level persists for a longer period of time, yes, it's just logical, rational to think it would have some impact. Now, that doesn't really mean much for this year or a bunch of next year because a lot of that stuff's in production. It's further out. However, if I'm right and things do start in the second half of the year to settle down, I don't think you have to believe that this has a lot of impact. Let's remember, and I grew up on that side of the business, our development community and I were optimists by nature that The development community you know, they're they're, you know, mostly a bunch of you know, a of small and medium-sized players, and this is their business. And they're they have a they have been doing it a long time. They have a very long view of the business. And so, yeah, I mean, when things rattle their cage, they may slow down and take a deep breath. But underneath it all, you know, as they've been committing the land and, you know, trying to get things production, their desire is really to get them into production short, something really meaningful happening. And that is not what we're and, you know, this is not, like, COVID or the great recession or any of these this is this is not that. Again, I think the world is asymmetrically risk to the downside. I'm much more equally weighted. I would say, again, if I amalgamate all the conversations I'm having with our development community, I'd say they're more akin to my level of thinking. So I think part of it, you know, like, I think this year, next year, we gotta work hard. I think, you know, we'll be able to deliver what we wanna deliver. As you get down to 27, 28, you know, there is the possibility you end up in a very long period of time of very high uncertainty, that people slow down some of the things they're doing. That's not what's happening now, okay, to be clear. And the reality is in more challenging times, there we get we pick up the slack like we've done this year very heavily in conversions. People in good times, they want to do conversions with us. More uncertain times, they really want to do conversions with us because they want the safety and the comfort of being in a system like ours that, you know, has, you know, hundreds of millions of loyalty members and drives such strong commercial performance. There is a counter countervailing or counterbalancing impact there. I think that answered it. Not see. I mean, the truth is just have there's no there there yet. And again, I think if I'm hopefully right about what starts to happen in the second half of the year, I think not to be a Pollyanna, I think we can I don't think we have to see meaningful impact?
Shaun Kelley: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hi, thanks. Hate to focus on maybe the downside case, but with the mindset of preparing for the worst and hoping for the best. I guess if the market or economy does take a turn lower, where would you generally expect to see that deterioration first in this environment? And then what levers or actions would you take to pivot the business, not only to weather that storm, but to improve the competitive positioning long term?
Chris Nassetta: Listen, it's hard to prognosticate. As I said, I gave you my view of what I think is happening. If the economy and there is always some risk that it goes the risk the risk is to the downside, and that's where the world heads. I think and Kevin may wanna jump on top of this too, I feel really good about where we are. The fact of the matter is, the business model, as you know, is super resilient. Just the basic model of capital light business, super high margin, 70 plus percent EBITDA margin business. We're at some of the lowest levels of leverage that we've had. No, you know, no big maturities, super significant access to liquidity. We have been hyper-efficient. I think you everybody would have to see versus competition and everything else on the G and A side. So I mean, listen, we were I could say a lot of those similar things we went into COVID, and the reality is COVID was hard, but we sort of sailed through COVID. And what I would say Steven, is, like, those I don't want that. I don't wish that upon us, and I don't think that's where we're going. But we are fully prepared for whatever eventuality there is. The reality is, I think every time that we have seen, I say this to our teams all the time, Every time we have seen these really disrupted environments, significant downdrafts, in the macroeconomic conditions, because of that strength and resiliency and because this team has been together a long time and is battle-tested, we have been able to really, I think, outmaneuver our competition and put ourselves in an even better position than we were before. I mean, COVID being sort of exhibit I mean, our you know, we're over a thousand basis point higher margin business from the peaks of pre-COVID to now. There are a lot of reasons for that, some of that is we did a whole bunch of things during COVID to generate incremental margin and efficiency as well as to pivot in a bunch of interesting ways you know, with different segments of business, SMBs, and otherwise. So I'm not gonna be specific other than say, think we're ready for whatever comes our way. I think we're a really seasoned team that knows how to address issues. Our attitude will be we're in great shape. We steady hand on the wheel and take advantage of whatever comes our way to make the company better, to deliver better performance for our owners, and ultimately you know, deliver better growth. So that translates into better opportunities for our shareholder base.
Stephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question today will come from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to I appreciate all the big picture commentary. I wanted to just focus on, Chris, something you indicated about, APAC and China, in particular. Gaining some share. Can you provide us with a little bit of color on the economic intensity of those deals relative to the totality? And some of the same question you just answered, but more specifically, to that area of the world and what you're seeing on the on the ground development wise. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I think, David, I'll take this one. I think we've talked about I mean, look, gave you some Chris talked about earlier our business in China is large and still keeps going strong. Part of that business in China as I think maybe what you're getting at is in a joint venture format for Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn where we share the economics. But the reality is we're not investing capital, and every one of those deals is like a lot of our franchise deals, no capital, infinite yield, and we're growing a huge presence and building a big brand name in China on the backs of those deals. So we've been very transparent about the economics on those deals. The rest of it is we continue to grow outside of those joint ventures, both in China and in other parts of the world, our economics are at Right? And so our economics in terms of the way you think about fees per room growing over time, we've talked about that. We think that for a bunch of reasons as we continue to do the bulk of our new deals at our current distribution level as RevPAR continues to grow, as we continue to raise royalty rates as deals rollover, we're going to grow our fees per room over time. And again, we're not investing capital in these regions. So big demand for our and then one more thing I'd add about China is we are now starting to grow in a big way a lot of our brands. That's outside of China. So Hilton Garden Inn remains a great story in China. We have over 100 hotels open over 100 Hilton Garden Inn's in China and nearly 200 more coming in the pipeline, right? So that those those deals are at market rates, full fees, higher RevPAR, than the Hamptons and Hilton Garden ends and on it goes across those regions. Through Southeast Asia. Middle East remains a good story. We talked about luxury lifestyle of being up to 1,000 hotels, right? As we gain momentum in these brands across the spectrum, there's really nothing that I would call out that should change the trajectory of our economic over time. Time. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Your next question today will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Mentioned Chris, the strength in group in the first quarter, I think you said up 6%. And I was just wondering if you could provide a little more commentary around maybe what you're seeing if the balance of the year, especially from like kind of the larger kind corporate group side because that can sometimes just be a proxy, I think, for how businesses are thinking about sending people on the road, etcetera, So just any updated color you have there would be of interest.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, still feel good about it for the full year if you think about our guidance of zero to two I think even at the low end of that group is sort of at the higher end of that range. And as you get up into the mid and higher, it's a you know, it's it's above above the high end of the range. So we feel we feel good about it. That's not, you know, and, you know, that is trust trust but verify. I think Ronald Reagan said that. We have a great group position on the books. Group position is up in the mid-single digits across the system, it sort of supports that. That group position is a little bit lower than it had been for a couple of important reasons. One, as you get into the year, it always comes down. And two, there's no question that some of the uncertainty in the environment has affected booking patterns across all segments. That's the one thing I'd say is, you have this uncertainty, everybody, you know, I sort of said it in my comments a little bit of the great wait and see. Let's see where it goes. So what do they do? They don't stop traveling. They don't stop running their businesses. They don't stop taking vacations. They may be do a little bit less of it or they wait a little bit more to the last minute. And so As you look at short-term group bookings, and I think I said it in my comments, they're sort of flat year-over-year, which is not bad. But if you you know, if you went further out, they're a little bit down because I think people are thinking, well, I don't want to plan further in the future at this exact moment, but I know I got to do it. So in fact, in the short intermediate numbers there, they're they're still showing up. If you look at into next year, you know, we're in we're in the teens. You know, we're up Our group position back to group is up that defies a little bit, but a lot of that has been on the books. We feel good that group will definitely lead the pack in terms of segments. People are, you know, are showing up. They're consuming the group room nights. You know, the pace of booking in the last six weeks or so is less than it had been just because of what's going on. Again, my belief is as we get hopefully to a little bit more you know, with a little more certainty in the environment, there's no reason sort of underneath at all why I think we wouldn't wouldn't see a tick up. But, we're still in the mid we're in the mid-single digits and our I think we've been reasonably conservative in sort of the guidance that the group component of the guidance we've given.
Smedes Rose: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great, thanks. I just wanted to clarify Kevin mentioned in the opening remarks that some of the outperformance in the non-RevPAR fee related was timing related. Or maybe it was something in G and A, but just there was something timing related. So just wanted to get clarity on that. And then if I could also just sort of ask for clarification on the comments about fee revenue per room because I do think that's been a big question that a lot of investors have asked. And I think your commentary about expecting that to continue to grow is better than expected. So I just want to make sure I understood think it was Kevin's comments about was the idea that the fee revenue per room in Asia ex China was growing faster and that's why you the fee revenue growth coming from China with the sort of more shared economics was in a concern for you in terms of that slowing or just want to make sure.
Chris Nassetta: Well, for China, we can talk, Kevin will talk about fees. In China, the fee per room growth from the point of where we are is going up simply because we really did these MLAs to build a broad network effect, is been incredibly successful. I think we've outmaneuvered everybody, but now, what we're doing is franchising. We built a team and we're franchising, particularly with Garden Inn other brands, our own brands. And so if you look at the sort of piece per room that we're generating now, and you've looked forward, a disproportionate piece of it's gonna come from full fee franchise deals that we're doing with our other brands. So that's why that's growing. On fees per room, I'll let Kevin take the first one. On fees per room, I think Kevin already said it, it's just math. I say this to investors all the time, it isn't that complicated. We have you know, our pipeline is pretty consistent with our existing supply. We talked about China individually. We continue to have rising RevPAR and we continue to drive share gains, you know, a large part of our growth is from our highest paying royalty fee brands, and we continue to move the royalties over time on our brands, you know, systematically higher. And when you just do the math, which we do, obviously, in long-range models, these per room are gonna go up as long as I as long as we look at. We do ten-year models, and fees per room are gonna go up every year. In those models. There's really it's just it's it's as I said, it's sort of structural and math based on those inputs.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. And then so then yeah. And that's that that covers it, Robin. I was I was speaking to the broader fees per room, yeah, I mean, coming out of China, fee per room growth from where we are today will be actually in a higher rate of growth than the rest of the business. But I think it's important to focus on the entire business because you're right, we do get that question a lot. And then back to the non-RevPAR driven fees and timing, they're somewhat connected and they're somewhat separate. A large part of addressing the beat and in terms of what we're carrying through for the rest of the year we wanted people to understand that it that a decent chunk actually sort of the vast majority of the beat for the first quarter was timing. Some of that was timing in non-RevPAR driven fees and some of that was timing in other parts of the business. Separately, non-RevPAR driven fees across the board, I wouldn't point to any one component, whether that's purchasing or credit cards or HGV or other things. Did outperform meaningfully in the first quarter and will continue to outperform over the course of the year and we expect those non-RevPAR driven fees to be above algorithm both for the year and going forward. We don't give a lot more specific guidance than that, but that's how I would characterize that.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Hi, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, Kevin, could you guys unpack the 2Q guidance, the guidance a little bit more specifically looking at what you're expecting for domestic RevPAR versus international? And then within domestic, if you could just unpack that comment about group being better than transient on the transient side, which of the transient segments are growing better or worse in sort of real time here? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. I think for the second quarter, it's the same story just with a little bit of don't know if idiosyncratic is the right way to say it. Some timing issues in the second quarter largely driven by the impact of the Easter shift. Right? So I think the way to think about this segment is group will continue to lead business transient will be next and then we expect leisure conditions in the near term given the uncertainty to remain softer. I think as you think about domestic versus international, I would think about domestic which is still the large driver of the outcome being about the same as the guidance being roughly flat and then the international parts of the business in line with what I've said, right? So Europe a little bit better, Middle East better than Europe, APAC ex China positive and China a little bit negative. I think it's just the same story, a little bit more muted because of the calendar shift.
Brandt Montour: Very helpful. Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Lizzie Dove: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to kind of zoom in a little bit on what the drivers or what was assumed in the kind of lowering of the EBITDA outlook I guess specifically in terms of any pressure from IMF participation, especially in The U.S. Or any kind of slowdown on the non-RevPAR side? I know, Kevin, you said those are still strong. I think given like the algo of like 12% to 14% in the past at the Investor Day. I'm curious if that still holds true today.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think, obviously, Lizzie, I'll take the second part first. Factually correct about our Investor Day guidance. Think, again, what we're saying about non-RevPAR driven fees is still ahead of algorithm, and there's nothing that's really changed about our Investor Day guidance in the in terms of the structure of the model or the drivers that I would change. Obviously, RevPAR growth is our RevPAR outlook for this year has changed and that is largely what is driving the EBITDA impact for the full year. So if you think about our normal sort of our normal sort of distribution of kind of roughly $25 million to $30 million per point. If you put that into the gunculator ex timing items that I talked about in Q1, that all holds together for the balance of the year. So there's no drivers in terms of in IMF growth a little bit lighter when RevPAR gets lighter, right? I mean IMF flows through it about 1.5 times typically will be positive for the year, I should state, even on zero to two, we're run mid-single digits. IMF growth for the year. But it all sort of tracks with the model really the primary driver, if not the entire driver of the balance of the year coming down is RevPAR coming down.
Chris Nassetta: And importantly, all that's right, if you take the full year, we're delivering algorithm. I mean, we're just the same store, new unit growth, Nug is staying the same, and same store is coming down. But when you add one plus one together, it's getting you to what you should get to. Algorithm's a lot of
Operator: Your next question today will come from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I was wondering if you could touch on the impact from Canadian travel, how that has changed since you know, Liberation Day and particularly the last couple weeks. And more importantly, when you speak to executives that have businesses up there or multinational executives that you know, could potentially bring corporate or leisure travelers down there, how they're thinking about you know, the feeling and sentiment with their employees. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Really, really good question. I would have been shocked if we didn't get that question given everything going on. So interesting in the in the quarter, you know, inbound international represents circa 4% of the business, something like that. So it's not huge, but know, it's meaningful. In the quarter, it was up. Even with all this going on. It was up in the mid-single digits on revenue basis. And so what you saw was a progression where it was up a lot in January, a little bit less in February, and it was sort of flat in March, which I mean, we could debate, and I don't know the answer whether that's the full force of you know, of the impact of what's going on vis a vis particularly Canada and Mexico, but what you saw was clearly through the quarter, a flattening out a leveling off, and with Canada and Mexico, you saw those both deteriorate to the point where they're down for us I would say, like, high single digits. Each of them is down high single digits. At the same time, the reason it's flat in March, and what we were sort of seeing in April is other markets, weaker dollar, a whole lot of other things going on, other markets are up. Up from the Asian markets, up from The UK, you know, up from other parts of Europe, At the moment, I would say in March and so far in April, it's sort of balanced out and it's been neutral. And we'll see. Again if we can settle some and create more certainty trade deals with some of these partners. Hopefully, we can settle some of these things down. Interestingly, I asked, you know, our development team was up in Canada doing a bunch of work because we obviously have a big business. And Kevin and I were with him and asking him, are you hearing a lot of noise? People want to do deals with us. And their answer was quite to the contrary that they didn't sense any sort of resentment or sentiment vis a vis our brands as in a US-based company that that was affecting the, you know, sort of the trajectory of our development opportunities in the market at the moment.
Kevin Jacobs: Certainly, we haven't felt any of that on the development side. In Mexico either. Chad, it's worth pointing out as well that, you know, Canada combined are about 1.5% of our total revenue. So it's not to say that if you are part of our system and you own a hotel in Detroit or Buffalo that you're, you know, you're or it's closer to the Mexican border that you're not feeling it. I don't want I'm not I don't mean to be flipping about it vis a vis our ownership community. But in terms of the grand scheme of our business, it's only 1.5% of revenue.
Chad Beynon: Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: Sure. And your next question today will come from Patrick Scholes with Truist. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: When we talk to franchisees large franchisees of some of your competitors, we hear that construction costs are up, you know, at a minimum of 20% and in some cases, up 40%. Is that consistent with what you're hearing from your franchisees? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: No. I think, Patrick, I think what I'd say is you may have and I'm not saying you're not having valid conversations because I know you talk to developers all the time. That is not being realized. I think that is that particularly when, you know, these things first got announced, that was the fear right, as if you if you think about your sourcing and overall what could happen to development costs and some uncertainty. I think a lot of that has settled down. We came into the year in The U.S. With construction costs kind of trending up mid-single digits, it hasn't really realized, call it 3% to five It kind of that hasn't realized yet and I think you have to take a little bit of a wait and see approach depending on how this all plays out as Chris was talking about earlier.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color on your side. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Want to go back to your comments on April and the weakness there, maybe just digging in a little deeper. Within leisure Can you maybe give us some color on high end versus low end, how each of those track? And then same within BT, any differentiation you see between small, medium-sized accounts and then the larger corporate accounts? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Not I mean here's the thing. So April will be a bit odd. April the business, because the Easter movement will be a bit better and business transient will be worse. So I think you gotta be careful you know, sort of trending in April given the shift in the holiday I think I think more broadly, what we have seen is sort of a of a pullback in demand across all categories of leisure, both at the high end and in the middle. And on business transient, which I made the comment on in our in the prepared comments, we've seen not so very little impact on the SMB business, because these folks got to get out and run their business and they're not going to not gonna be as quick to make decisions and a little bit more on the big corporates. Having said that, there's been sort of a, you know, a bright spot, which has been in banking and finance where we have seen a pretty nice uptick. But broadly, I'd say big business is always going to be a little bit more cautious. They're gonna be a little bit more waiting to see where all this goes, where SMBs are gonna you know, in the moment, they gotta run their business. And, thankfully, SMBs 85 plus percent of our business transient book. So far so good. Again, we haven't everybody's worried the markets are asymmetric risk to the downside, You have heard what we where we are for the quarter, but also sort of March April, you know, it's we're still seeing positive growth. Not it isn't it isn't as though the growth rates have gone negative. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance, probably to be fair, leisure is kind of flat at the midpoint, but it's not really negative, but we would expect as I've already talked about, group to be up in a pretty decent way and even business transient to be up in that scenario. In fact, that's what we're seeing right now. Now we got to get through this Easter shift. But if you look at you know, if you sorta try as best we can to sort of neutralize for the Easter effect, we're still seeing growth just growth at a little bit lower level than what we would have hoped for expected coming into the year.
Michael Bellisario: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question today will come from Meredith Jensen with HSBC. Please go ahead.
Meredith Jensen: Yes, thanks. I was hoping you might speak a little bit to further into the development and how the conversion, process prospects are looking now versus a year ago potentially with the changes in construction costs and the like spoken about? And how this may or may not sort of shift ongoing discussions of M and A in the sector, maybe not for Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. because I know the bias towards organic growth, but maybe on just those few topics to speak a little bit more would be great. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. So on the thanks, Meredith. On the conversion front, I mean, we gave a little bit of the color. We think conversions will be about 40% of our deliveries this year. That's a little bit higher than last year. You think about the stuff we did last year on the partnership side, you know, those are larger conversions. So, you know, if you but if you neutralize conversion conversions are up year-over-year. We tend to take share. I mean, I think Chris touched on this earlier. In an environment where it gets a little bit harder to do new builds, developers lean into conversions. And then when the environment gets a little bit softer, we tend to take share. So we already, in The U.S., do nearly half of the conversions that got signed in The U.S. Last year, pretty close to half were with us. And pretty close to half were with all of our competitors combined. Right? So in a softening environment, we take even more share. Those deals, they're all different, right? Spark is driving a fair amount of that, but only call it 30%-ish of our conversions this year will be Spark. We did a bunch of DoubleTree's in the first quarter and in our first quarter signings, did conversions across 10 of our brands. So it really is mixed across the portfolio. And if someone can buy a trading asset or owns a trading asset today that's independent, it's a lot easier to finance. A lot of these conversions happen around transactions. And these transactions are just a lot easier to finance within place cash flows, and our brands become very attractive to both the equity and the debt finance for those deals. So we would continue we feel really good about the environment. And then we're doing a lot of conversions outside The U.S. Right? Our conversion deliveries this year will be about fifty-fifty U.S. And outside The U.S. So when we get sort of really focused on these conditions in The U.S, you have to remember the conditions remain a little bit different around the world. So we feel in short, we feel really good, and then I'll let Chris take the M and A.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. On the M and A, I think implied in your question, I think you were headed in the right direction. I mean, we are much more focused on organic growth. We, obviously did a couple of things last year, but we thought those were very unique in the sense of you know, fit very nicely into the portfolio brands that we had and space that we wanted to fill with really great brands, and we really feel like the value proposition for us was spectacular. And so we really are excited with those, and they're going really well. We look at, as we always have, everything that you read about that anybody's doing, you should assume we've looked at it. And that given our size and scale and all of these things for the most part are broadly marketed, you know, that we have chosen not to pursue it. And, you know, or certainly to any any type of conclusion. That's because the truth is we like organic growth other than a couple of things last year that we've done for almost twenty years. We've had great success in building what we think are the industry-leading brands, certainly the industry-leading performing brands, We have 24 brands that you know, that give us huge amount of opportunity in every market, including where we have the biggest distribution in The United States, where we still have huge growth opportunities. And we are a degree, I would say in most parts of the world still very early in gestation in terms of propagating the full family of brands that we have. At the same time, we're always looking at within these segments that opportunities, and there are two or three things that that we are working on in terms of new brands, that would be done organically. A couple of those in the lifestyle space, potentially a lifestyle collection that would be under Tapestry to take unique hotels that we think would be very additive to the system from a customer point of view, real demand in the owner marketplace, and we really don't haven't had a place to put those. And then a hard brand in between Motto and Canopy where, again, we see big segment of demand that we're not really serving in a in and an owner community that is looking to do around the world a lot more of that. Then I've talked about a number of times the old accommodations we call it or furnished apartment space where we've done huge amount of work there. My expectation is you will see us do something there. We look at everything and, you know, the yeah. I always have to say never say never, but we have made I think, great progress over twenty years of doing it the old-fashioned way. I think we've built a skill set and a team that is really, really good at this, and as I said, we got 24 brands. My guess is in the next year two, we're gonna have 27 at least. That we think will continue to fill niches within the family of brands that will provide customers some great opportunities and better serve our owner community on things that they wanna do. So I think that's the likely path you will highly likely path you will see us follow.
Meredith Jensen: Super clear and helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, everybody. As always, we appreciate the time. Lots of great questions. There's obviously a lot going on the world, a lot of which we talked about, but as I've said a few times we feel really good about the position the business is in. We love our model. We're in a really good position from a balance sheet liquidity point of view. You know, driving, you know, incredibly high margins. And even though there's some choppiness out there, we're really confident our ability to continue delivering for you all. So we'll look forward after the next quarter to give you an update and let you know exactly what we're thinking at that time. Thanks again for the time and have a great day.
Operator: Conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2025-02-06 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. To ask a question, you may press star then one. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Head of Development, Operations, and Investor Relations. Please begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you, Betsy. Welcome to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s fourth quarter and full year 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements.
Kevin Jacobs: Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors of our most recently filed Form 10-Ks. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're happy to report a great end to another strong year, marked by record unit growth and several important milestones. We added new brands and strategic partnerships to meet guests' needs. We opened more rooms than in any other year in our history, all of which further strengthened our network and positioned Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. for continued growth in 2025 and beyond. Thanks to our incredible team members and owners, we also welcomed more than 224 million guests to our properties, more than any year in our history. For the full year, system-wide RevPAR increased 2.7% compared to 2023, with growth across all segments and all major regions. Solid top-line performance coupled with strong net unit growth drove record adjusted EBITDA of more than $3.4 billion, up 11% year over year, demonstrating the strength of our fee-based business model and the power of our growth algorithm. Significant free cash flow generation enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders. Turning to results for the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 3.5% year over year, above the high end of our guidance range, driven by better-than-expected trends in leisure and continued growth in business transient and group. Leisure transient RevPAR increased 4%, driven by solid growth in both occupancy and rate, with particularly strong trends throughout December. In the quarter, leisure occupancy remained five points higher than pre-pandemic levels. Business transient RevPAR increased more than 3%, led by continued recovery in large corporates, with big tech and big banks meaningfully outperforming. Group RevPAR rose 3% year over year as demand for company meetings and social events remained strong. Additionally, booking windows continued to lengthen, and strong demand in conventions and company meetings drove higher rates for future periods. As we look to the year ahead, we feel incrementally a bit better than we did a quarter ago and expect system-wide top-line growth of 2% to 3% for 2025. We expect relatively steady growth across the Americas, modest deceleration in EMEA due to tough comparisons following a robust year last year, and growth across Asia Pacific given improvements in China and continued strength throughout the rest of the region. We also expect positive RevPAR growth across all major segments, with group outperforming driven by continued strength in company meetings and convention business. We assume very modest RevPAR growth in leisure transient, given forecasts for steady levels of consumer spending and challenging comparisons. We expect continued recovery in business transient driven by further momentum in large corporates, coupled with steady demand across small and medium-sized businesses. Turning to development, we opened 171 hotels in the fourth quarter, totaling nearly 23,000 rooms, as our strategic and diversified approach to development continued to expand into new markets around the world. During the quarter, we opened our first Tapestry hotels in Paraguay, Bonaire, and Australia, helping the conversion-friendly lifestyle brand to surpass 150 hotels in 20 countries and territories worldwide. We also debuted our Curio brand in Romania and opened our first Hampton in Africa, Tru in Colombia, Hilton Garden Inn in Greece, and Spark in Austria. In Asia Pacific, we celebrated the opening of our thousandth hotel ahead of schedule, representing growth of more than 30% versus last year. For the full year, we added a record 973 hotels representing nearly 100,000 rooms and the single biggest increase in rooms in Hilton's more than 100-year history, driving net unit growth of 7.3%. Conversions accounted for roughly 45%, driven by the addition of SLH properties and continued momentum from Spark, DoubleTree, and our conversion-friendly lifestyle brands. Overall, luxury lifestyle hotels accounted for roughly half of our system-wide openings in the year, bringing those portfolios to more than 900 hotels across the world. Additionally, our luxury and lifestyle pipeline mix is nearly two times our existing supply, supporting continued growth in these important segments. Even with record openings, our system-wide pipeline grew 8% year over year to total approximately 500,000 rooms at year-end. We signed 154,000 rooms in the year, up 18% and representing our biggest year of signings to date. We also ended the year with several notable signings, including the Waldorf Astoria Bahrain, Waldorf Astoria Al Madinah in Saudi Arabia, Conrad in Los Cabos, and our first Motto in China, and agreements to debut LXR, Curio, and Hampton in Morocco. Construction starts for the year remained strong, the highest in our history, increasing 10% year over year across all regions. Excluding acquisitions and partnerships with meaningful growth, we finished the year with nearly a quarter million rooms under construction, which is more than any other hotel company. This represents more than 20% of industry share of rooms under construction relative to our existing share of supply. With nearly half of our pipeline under construction and continued growth and conversion opportunities, we feel confident in our ability to deliver strong net unit growth of 6% to 7% in 2025, defined by our continued focus on geographic and chain scale diversity. We have exciting development opportunities ahead. LiveSmart Studios is slated to open its first locations this summer. Following the recent opening of Spark's 100th hotel, the brand has several international market debuts, including India and the CALA region, scheduled for this year. We expect our newly announced strategic licensing agreement with Olive by Embassy to accelerate Spark's expansion in India, representing an exciting opportunity to tap into the country's growing middle class. We also expect continued momentum in luxury, including the iconic Waldorf Astoria in New York. Following an extensive and thoughtfully designed renovation, the 375-room hotel will usher in a new era of luxury for New York City. This year, we will also welcome Waldorf Astoria properties in Costa Rica, Shanghai, Osaka, and Morocco, in addition to Conrad Hotels in Athens and Hamburg. Signia celebrated an important milestone just last week, with the opening of the brand's first hotel outside the US, located in Amman, Jordan. The property offers another sought-after location for business and leisure travelers. Demonstrating our continued commitment to meeting the evolving preferences of our guests, we recently announced several new wellness initiatives. In January, we expanded our partnership with Peloton to provide guests with complimentary access to classes on our in-room TVs. We also recently partnered with Calm, a leading wellness company, to offer guests access to guided meditation, sleep stories, calming soundscapes, and mindfulness exercises directly from their in-room TVs. Thanks to our incredible team members around the world, we continue to be recognized for our culture. During the fourth quarter, we celebrated our eighth consecutive year as the top hospitality company on the World's Best Workplace list by Great Place to Work. Our brands also continue to receive recognition, most recently by Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500. For the sixteenth consecutive year, Hampton took the number one spot in the lodging category, thanks to its strong preference, global growth, and guest loyalty. In total, twelve of our brands received recognition, underscoring the value they drive for owners and guests and our leadership in franchising and innovation across the hospitality industry. We are proud of the record growth we delivered last year. Our powerful network of brands continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders. Given our strong momentum, robust pipeline, and resilient fee-based business model, we're confident that we are well-positioned to continue driving strong performance in 2025 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a little bit more details on the quarter and our expectations for the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by adjusted EBITDA, which was $858 million in the fourth quarter, up 7% year over year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected RevPAR growth. Management franchise fees grew 5% year over year, ahead of our expectations despite an FX drag. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.76. Turning to our regional performance, fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was up 2.9%, driven by strong leisure demand and continued improvement across business transient and group. For full year 2025, we expect U.S. RevPAR growth at the low end of our wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 8.1% year over year, driven by increased air capacity to the region and strong leisure trends during the holidays. For full year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid-single-digit range. In Europe, RevPAR grew 6.2% year over year in the fourth quarter. For full year 2025, we expect low to mid-single-digit RevPAR growth following the region's strong performance in 2024. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 8.4% year over year, supported by key events, including COP29 in Baku and Formula One races in Qatar and Abu Dhabi. For full year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid-single-digit range. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 1.7% year over year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 8.8%, led by strong leisure performance in Southeast Asia during the holiday season. China RevPAR declined 4% in the quarter as softer macro conditions and cloud travel continued to weigh on performance. However, trends improved sequentially versus the third quarter, driven by Golden Week and an uptick in demand following fiscal stimulus, with positive momentum carrying into the New Year. For full year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth in Asia Pacific to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, assuming low single-digit growth in China. Turning to development, as Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 7.3% and ended the year with over 498,000 rooms in our pipeline, which was up 8% year over year, with more than half located outside the U.S. and nearly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we are excited about our strong development story and the robust demand for Hilton branded products in both the U.S. and international markets. Moving to guidance, for the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 3.5% year over year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $770 million and $790 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.57. For full year 2025, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.7 billion and $3.74 billion and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $7.71 and $7.82. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $150 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2024, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $3.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you
Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. If at any time your question has been addressed, The first question today comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Chris, I wanted to build off a mention that you made in your prepared remarks, just a bit more of a macro one here to start. But we obviously just went through a major U.S. election cycle since you know, our last call and our last update. You've undoubtedly spoke with a number of hotel and business leaders, and you said that, you know, you sounded a little bit more confident than where we were a quarter ago. So can you just expand on that comment a little bit? What are some of those conversations with business leaders looking like right now? And maybe what segments of the lodging business could we expect this some of the sentiment improvement to possibly impact? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Yeah. Happy. I assume somebody would ask me that. I'm glad we're getting to it early. And, obviously, these are just my opinions, but that's what you're asking for. And most of this I think, would not surprise you or anybody in the sense of sort of the general view on what's going on in the macro. I mean, if you go back a quarter ago, we hadn't gotten to an election. There was a lot of noise around the election, and there was a lot of uncertainty around the outcome of the election at that time. And that uncertainty then translated into a whole bunch of uncertainty around things that people care about, you know, whether that's consumers from a leisure point of view and certainly business and group ends up being a lot, you know, very directly related to business with huge, massive uncertainty on regulatory spending, regulatory immigration, border, tax policy, and the practical reality is not just the uncertainty around the election, but the uncertainty around all of those outcomes means that people sort of husband their capital a little bit more. They pull in their reins a little bit. They're a little bit more tepid, I think, broadly. In spending. So fast forward to today, we have an election. That is complete. Whether you like it or not, it was pretty dispositive. It wasn't, like, close. It wasn't disputed. You know, we knew in a day and or not even a day, and while there is certainly a lot of noise in a cycle of things that are going on by EO and every living in Washington. Trust me. I hear a lot of the noise, you know, if I live inside the Beltway. I mean, I think there is a broader belief, and I'll get to what I'm hearing from other leaders that will go nameless. There is a broad belief, and I would say fairly consistent, you know, amongst the folks that I talk to across a broad range of industries. That people think that the opportunity for economic growth in the short to intermediate term will be better. That doesn't mean that people don't think that there's noise and some people appreciate it more than others, you know, in terms of the various things that are going on. But I think almost to a person that I'm talking to really, quietly. I think people feel like you're gonna see there is an opportunity for a pickup more broadly in economic growth, and that there's an opportunity, you know, I think in our business as a result, you know, for a bit of an uptick, which is why I said I feel a bit better. Why? Because you have an election behind you. One, while there's a lot of noise, you're gonna be in a lighter regulatory environment across the board. Financial services, you know, broad range of industries. Two, tax policy. I mean, unclear. It's gonna take time. You know, we're all reading about the morning. You know, one reconciliation build, two, we're gonna be debating it and trust me. You know, we're talking to a lot of people about it. It's gonna be unclear when exactly how it happens. But it sort of has to happen. And I think, you know, certainly, the business community is much more optimistic that, you know, that's gonna get done in a way that is favorable. And so, again, across the board, as I talk to folks. But by the way, talk to friends and, you know, think about, you know, as it affects leisure business. But certainly talking to folks that are running businesses across a broad range of three I really can't think of one. That doesn't mean it didn't happen, but it's not in my memory set. Of somebody that thought that this is gonna be what's happening is negative for broader economic growth. So that's why I feel that you know, a bit more positive. Now, there is a lot of noise, right, particularly in the beginning. So the reason that we're not, you know, in our guidance and all those things, not going crazy in terms of building big upside is because there's a lot happening and it's early. And I think we need to see how these sort of things play out. But I think the general sentiment, I've said it is underneath it all when you lift you know, I guess, say, above it all. When you lift up above all the noise. Is that this is going to be good for the U.S. economy. And to a degree, that will have some knock-on impact in various economies, you know, around the world as a result.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thank you. Despite that positive business demand outlook, coming out of ALICE, it seemed like there was a lot of skepticism around the development backdrop just given where returns are versus interest rates. Yet you sound pretty positive on the development pipeline. Clearly, your pipeline's been growing. So I'm just would love to hear how you think about what has set Hilton apart from you know, that much more cautious kind of tone at the, at the industry conference.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I was there, not for long, but I did the main panel. And so I, you know, we had a big owner reception. I think we have four hundred owners. So I talked to a lot of people in a in the short time I was there. And so not to Steven I I appreciate the comment and you were probably there longer than I, but I would probably frame it a little bit differently and maybe what I, you know, I know, sort of like break it down into, like, you know, what how people felt about M&A activity, versus, you know, how they're sort of feeling about new development activity. And I I would say my read of it, again, not to take issue with it, was generally on on the first M&A much more positive I think people are very much of there's more capital available. Rates have moved up a bit, but I think there's a belief you know, that over the next twelve, twenty-four months, broadly, rates will come down. I think people feel like the bid and the ask is getting closer because you know, performance has, you know, has ticked up a bit. And so I sensed, and in fact, we were asked on the panel, and I think the answer for most of the folks on the panel with me was you know, a lot more optimism in M&A. In terms of the new development side of it, which is I think probably what you're referencing more, there's still, you know, a lot of friction for the reasons that you're describing. You know, during COVID, following COVID, it got very expensive to build. Cost structures went up. And so it got hard and and and interest rates went up and capital availability went down and so that's a awfully difficult equation for for new construction. I sensed actually you know, some increasing optimism. And so the question is why? Well, again, people broader view, I think, was you know, don't wanna get ahead of ourselves, but more optimistic about what's gonna go on broadly with the economy. So improving performance, stabilization of cost to build, stabilization on labor cost, there are other, you know, component cost insurance and others that are still going up, but some stabilization and frankly the largest parts of of the expense base. A, you know, I believe and I think people are figuring this out an opportunity for rates, as I said, over the next twelve to twenty-four months to come down and is moderating as we see that one of the largest components of inflation as measured by the the federal government is shelter. Which is on a lag and is still showing up at, you know, above target levels when reality of shelter costs are going up, that closer to one percent. So as you start to see that dataset factored into, you know, the inflation numbers, you're gonna see a very large component of inflation come down. Obviously, the administration's super focused on energy and try trying bring energy costs down, which is another large contributor that has broad impact. So I do I believe and I think people people are starting to believe that there is an opportunity not for rapid deceleration, in in in interest rates. There is over the next twelve to twenty-four months a likelihood that rates are gonna come down. And then last but not least, I do believe people are seeing more availability of capital. It's not a gusher. You know, but I think they're seeing more availability ability of capital. And I think there is a belief, which is what was driving, I think, again, I wanna be careful. It wasn't raging optimism, but sort of a bit of a a shift, at least amongst our our owner community is that in a world where the regulatory environment's gonna get a lot easier on the on the financial system, which I think is pretty clearly happening. And a world where the broader economic growth is stable, but, you know, moving up a tick, you know, that there's gonna end up by definition, as there always is in that kind of cycle, being more capital available because the lending institutions of all sorts are gonna have to go further on the risk spectrum to get their yields. And as a result, gonna be looking more and more to do build and and that kind of activity. And that that's a normal cyclical thing that happens but I think with the regulatory environment that that we're moving into, it it will accelerate that. So I I again, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say I I'm not taking issue with what you were hearing. There's certainly a lot of friction, and we hear that. But I would say, I started to sense a movement you know, to to a more positive place. Now the last part of it, sorry, and I'll stop, you know, why are we doing what why are we doing well? How are we defining you didn't it but I'll say it's sort of how are we defining gravity and what's been you know, a difficult environment you know, for new construction and development generally. And I think the answer is twofold. One, we I mean, it's all related to our brands who are the best performing brands in the industry. So while there isn't as much money, I think there's more coming. We are getting a very disproportionate share. We're just more financeable with the money that's available for new construction. And because our brands perform the best in the industry, we get a large disproportionate amount of conversion opportunities. I think over the last twelve months, we're not quite fifty percent of all conversion opportunities are moving in into our system. And so those two things you know, are uniquely helping have been uniquely helping us over the last couple of years, and I think we'll continue to help us, but I do believe the other things I said as well.
Stephen Grambling: That's great. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris, Kevin. Good morning. Good morning. Chris, I I you spoke a lot about development and and conversions and stuff. And I might have missed this. You might have said earlier. One of you may have said it, but conversions as a percentage of of your unit growth in twenty-four and then kinda how you see how you see that shaping up for twenty-five? Then I just had a quick follow-up.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. For for twenty-four, if you include everything, the acquisitions and partnerships, it was about forty-five percent. It was in my prepared comments, I think. It was. And if you take those out, it was about a third plus or minus. I think this year, twenty-five will be about a third. You know? That mean meaning that we don't we don't have any big play I mean, there'll be some very modest incremental growth in our partnerships, but I would I would do that in at our scale sort of a rounding error. And so, you know, we're we're gonna go back to, you know, sort of more normally where we'd be, which is elevated from the mid-twenties into the low to mid-thirties. But know, not not up where we were last year. And what was the last part?
Carlo Santarelli: No. The the second part, I just had a follow-up. The as as you look at your guidance, obviously, first quarter RevPAR guidance a little bit better than the full year. Adjusted EBITDA guidance obviously, you know, you're you're facing a challenging comparison. Was there were there some I don't wanna say, abnormalities, but some one-offs that that were benefits in the one Q twenty-four that that you'll kinda have to lap just so at kinda the the midpoint of of your adjusted EBITDA growth over year is looking like four to five percent versus kind of eight and a half percent for the full year. So I just wanna get a little bit of color on on some of the moving parts for the first quarter.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. You hit on it, Carlo. It is a tougher comp, and that was driven by a couple of one-time items. And then you've got some FX impact in the first quarter. If you adjust for all that, it's basically in line with the algorithm.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question comes from Lizzie Dove with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Lizzie Dove: Hi there. Thanks for taking the question. Another Alice one, but seems like you're defying gravity a little bit on the cost side too with, you know, the great EBITDA guide yet at Alice last week, there was a lot of talk around cost pressures in the industry. Particularly on, you know, the insurance side, the wage side. You maybe talk about just how you're thinking about that broadly and any initiatives you have to offset it?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, Lizzie. I think if you're talking about us in our, you know, in our cost structure, we we continue to be very disciplined. Our, you know, our GAAP G and A guide for the year, you probably noticed is even slightly lower than twenty nineteen after six years of of cost inflation. I, you know, I think on the on the operating side, as you say with owners, you know, yeah, there are some cost pressures and we have you know, we just have to keep we are and we'll continue to work for our owners to try to find as many operational efficiencies as we can so that so that they can grow their bottom lines as well and, you know, doing doing the best we can on on wages and benefits, doing the best we can on insurance, just helping them with operating efficiencies across the board. So you're so I I've actually missed Dallas this year. So I but my guess is you were hearing a little bit from the ownership side on cost pressures. And then for us, we just continue to remain disciplined.
David Katz: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead. It does appear that you're making some good traction in the luxury side of things. I also observed that you know, some of the capital deployed, you know, is up a bit this year and obviously, what we're hearing in in, you know, around analysis that the checks people are writing for luxury hotels are going up. Can you just give us a little more depth into sort of how you're thinking about that? Obviously, the strategy is getting some traction. But, you know, balancing that with you know, some of the capital required to play in that segment. Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Sure. I mean, I think if you think about it, it's been on where you are in the world. We are getting a ton of traction in luxury. And depending on where you are in the world, capital contributions from the operator can be can be higher or lower. In the Western world, they tend to be higher in that space. It's probably worth noting that a bunch of our traction in luxury, at least last year, came from the SLH partnership, which completely capitalized, right? Zero contribution on our part. You are hearing about some deals up there. I'll there as you get into the higher end of the range. Particularly in luxury, there are more competitors. Right? In in our bread and butter, in the mid-market, know, depending on where you are and the location, know, maybe the list of brands that you want to play with is, you know, two or three, and we we might be at the top of that list. When you get into the higher end of the range of luxury and the higher ends of full service, that that the number of brands know, in the aperture opens up pretty wide, and so the laws of supply and demand are alive and well. So it creates a lot of demand for key money. With all of that said, we still only contribute key money on ten percent or less of our deals. We do play in some of those deals because they're important and they tend to be from time to time higher checks. But I think if you look at what we do versus our competitors, you know, I'll take our track record against anybody's any day. And then the last thing is you talked about a little bit of the trajectory. You know, last year was a little bit light. I'd say there are a couple of deals out there where the timing has kind of pushed into twenty twenty-five. So you're seeing that a little bit in our guidance. And our guidance for this year is right in line with what we said at the Investor Day, two fifty to three hundred I think that's the right way to think about it on a run rate basis.
David Katz: Okay. Thank you. And that's for all CapEx including KeyMite.
Kevin Jacobs: Yep. Thank you. Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you. So, you know, obviously, great Q4 result, and and better twenty-five RevPAR guidance than a quarter ago. I did want to ask about you know, you often talk about the algorithm growth algorithm being RevPAR plus unit growth and getting to see growth and kind of moving higher as as you move down the P&L, and it seems like for twenty-five that the EBITDA growth rate is a little bit lower than the sort of midpoint of your RevPAR unit growth. Just wondering what may be going on there and sort of wondering if it's tied to, you know, in Q4, it looked like based on other management fees were were down a bit. And so if if there's something there that is sort of continuing into twenty twenty-five that's not bringing the that top line growth kind of getting magnified as it moves down the P&L? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, Robin. It's a good question. I'll take the second part first because it's a little bit more straightforward answer. If you adjust those base and other fees for some one-time items in FX, it actually would have been in the high single digits and that was all baked into our guidance for Q4 and the numbers we gave you and we beat that guidance. So it actually came in a little bit better than we thought. So there's nothing going on there other than timing and some FX. And then for the full year twenty-four, yeah, our mid the midpoint of our guidance guidance is at eight and a half. Algorithm would suggest nine. Again, the same it's actually the same answer as Carlos' question earlier in Q4. Where if you adjust for some of the one-time items last year, and you adjust for FX, we're above algorithm for this year at the midpoint.
Chris Nassetta: Are there any one-time and importantly, if you go back and look at even with that, if you go back and look at investor day, sort of what we laid out, yep. Bottom line, EBITDA numbers are higher than what we would have laid out a year ago for twenty twenty-five even with the FX. Really is FX. If you take FX out, it's above the algorithm. I mean, either one-time thing is going on, but it's really FX. But even still, even with the FX, bottom line EBITDA is higher than what we presented to everybody know, in our in our three-year plan. And that's because, again, we're super disciplined. Like, we were super disciplined on the top line. We're also disciplined on cost structure. And so if you think about this business versus nineteen, we finished last year well, EBITDA margins that are over one thousand basis points higher than the prior peak of twenty nineteen. So think that's a pretty good testament to the discipline that we have running this business.
Robin Farley: Thank you. That's super, super helpful color. Just let anything you'd call out in terms of those one-time items, just so we can think about that when we're thinking about the quarterly cadence just sort of any of the big ones you'd call out.
Kevin Jacobs: No. It's just sort of the lumpy you know, there are all sorts of their term fees are all sorts of things that happen in a normal year and they sometimes get weighted in one quarter versus the other. And and and in this case, that some of them were weighted in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty-four or twenty-three and the first quarter of twenty twenty-four once you once you get through that those those go away. I mean, you still have FX. Depending on where the dollar goes, that's that all washes away. And, obviously, for the full year, it washes away. Kevin? You saw our guidance for the full year.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just following on that question, Kevin. If you could just maybe bridge the rest of the P&L. When we look at EPS guide, versus, again, the Investor Day algo, it's it's you know, below that. Obviously, buybacks are not in the the full year guide, but it was in the the three-year algo. But, yeah, look, the the the bottom end of the EBITDA guide is right there in line. It makes sense with your RevPAR it looks like the EPS is still a little lower. And if you could provide some extra color there, I'm sure it'd be helpful.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Sure, Brandt. I mean, you look you mentioned that the big, you know, big driver is buybacks, but that that was all factored for, and I assume you're factored for. The other one is just leveraging, right? We we we did two billion dollars of financing to relever the balance sheet to fund our to help fund our buyback program. This past year, we've got another about similar amount next year, and it's just a little bit higher rates than than we had been borrowing at before, and so you're just seeing that catch up flow through to EPS. And other other than that, if you adjusted for all that, we'd be in the mid-teens in terms of adjusted EPS growth. Yeah. And while you're relevering.
Chris Nassetta: It hasn't impact longer term, it doesn't have any impact meaning once you've stabilized that's a certain leverage level than year over year.
Brandt Montour: Excellent. Thanks, everybody.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you just really thinking about maybe just the U.S. for a moment and your top about your RevPAR expectations. Across the system. But when you think about kind of just the luxury or upscaled, you know, full-service properties versus select service, would you expect to continue to see more relative weakness on the select server side or any kind of commentary there of what you know, how you think the year could unfold and maybe what's what's weighing or supporting your expectations for that segment?
Kevin Jacobs: No. I think, Smedes, you might I'm it's I I think talking about Q4. Are you talking about Q4 relative to chain scale performance?
Smedes Rose: Well, and for the year as well. I mean, I most It's really just I'm sorry. I mean, you're.
Kevin Jacobs: It's really just year over year comps. Right? So I think we I wouldn't we wouldn't call out any any underperformance. We continue to be in line or better than chain scale performance for the full year twenty twenty-four. We're gaining share and we expect that to continue.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Kevin. Morning. Mark, good morning. One thing I don't think I've heard you speak about is tariffs and specifically, you know, what potentially might be any impacts on your franchisees or potential developers and builders. You know, what what are you hearing from them? And the last time I blinked, I believe they would care of us at the moment. Could change in a moment is the ten percent from China. But, you know, I'd like to hear your thoughts around that potential and.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. If any happy to talk about it. As you pointed out, embedded in your question is they're tariffs and then they're not. And it's it's sort of moving around a lot. So far, obviously, you know, we've talked to a lot of people, not not any real impact to to speak of. It depends what happens. I do I do believe what's playing out is a series of trade negotiations, you know, that are that are delicate and I believe tariffs are part of that negotiation and part of the strategy to getting to the right kinds of deals in the end. So doesn't mean there won't be tariffs. But my guess is that that we will end up in most cases in a place where we get some form of trade deal done that will not involve major tariffs. And so again, I sort of like that all of you that know me know, I like to lift up above all the noise. This whole steady hand on the wheel. Think when you lift above it all, you know, I still believe that with the opportunity is broadly even with all the noise of tariffs and I'll come back to supply chain. In the second, we're going to that we have broader economic growth that's better than we thought it was going to be, not not worse even with the risk of various negotiations and short-term tariff imposed imposition of short-term tariffs. One of the things that we've done, so far no impact and frankly not to say it depends what happens that we we couldn't have impact, but we've diversified our supply chains in a very aggressive way. Over the last five years. I mean, think about what happened in COVID. You know, like, couldn't get things. So, you know, part of it was driven by the necessity of diversification coming out of COVID. But then we continued on because we just think it's a really good idea to have various places in the world where we can get various products. So that's not, like, we're getting Terry from one place in the world for the whole system. You know, because that would create risk that if you, you know, had a problem with tariffs in that particular location, it could cause a ripple effect. So I would say, again, never you know, I can't say it would have no impact, but we we have done our HSM team has a terrific job of diversifying our supply chain. And so we feel pretty good feel pretty good that Lulu's what's going on so far and that and and the areas that are in question that we have ways to pivot you know, given our supply chain relationships in other other parts of the world.
Patrick Scholes: Thank you. Well said and explained.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Michael. Just wondering if there's any commentary you can give on deletions and also what might be falling out of the pipeline. Any color on how those might be trending and and what the read-throughs would be there? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: It's a good question. We, you know, we we generally remove a point to a point in a quarter of the system every year. I mean, it's sort of same answer we've talked about before, Michael. Most of those are our choice. We did do a little bit more last year for twenty twenty-four than than typical than that run rate, but but everything that's baked into our expectation for twenty-five is consistent with long-term averages.
Operator: The next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about your comment on large corporations traveling more. Kind of that impact on on BT and group. Wondering when you started to see that acceleration and now that we have more certainty and and some more certainty around policy inside the Beltway. If that could be a a a big positive swing factor, you know, sequentially as we kinda work through the next couple months, for the go forward. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: It certainly could be. We are not we we have not, you know, given you guidance or forecasted that. I would say we saw throughout the fourth quarter, you know, an uptick and then particularly election. You know, demonstrated by midweek strength. Now, you know, I think that was based on all the things that I described earlier. People belief on, you know, more certainty on tax, regulatory environment, it's just more more comfort, you know, spending more. I think you know, part of it was that the way the holidays fell, it compressed the fourth quarter in terms of travel days. And that, you know, that gave us a benefit in the fourth quarter. But net net, as I said, every every CEO I'm talking to, we've met I met with our head of sales, you know, across all our special corporate account. I mean, uniformly, I think people whether it hadn't in part because the election, which I think it probably did, but it was happening anyway, just in in a, you know, sort of normal cycle of people getting back to office and getting more serious about running their businesses and sort of back to a little bit of business as usual. You know, if you talk to all accounts, if you talk to large, medium, small. Almost, you know, without exception, people are broadly saying that they're gonna travel more. Okay? And they broadly understand that they're gonna pay more for their travel because they then that the environment they're living in. And so I do think that you know, that bodes well for business transient recovery to continue to, you know, sort of beat our way back to prior. Obviously, rate structures are higher. We're still not back to prior levels demand, but I think by the end of the year, there's certainly a pretty good shot of being able to do that. Same same with group and leisure as I commented on my introductory comments. Leisure's already way over. So I, you know, I think you'll see some substitution effect. As between the segments, which which will be good. You know? What you should wanna see, and I certainly is you know, as business transient demand levels you know, sort of recover. And then I think we'll ultimately go beyond prior peaks in in core demand you'll be trying to, you know, sort of manage your inventory in a way where you're taking out lower price segments that would be, you know, sort of lower rated leisure. We wanna keep the high rated leisure, but some of the lower rated leisure. Which we're super we're super focused on as a type. So it's a long long winded way of saying it was happening in the fourth quarter. It accelerated in you know, in a post-election world. The trend so far are are sort of indicative of the same thing, although it's early in the year, you know. You're not you're not you had the holidays falling away, where January wasn't, you know, a a barn burner. I mean, we it was fine and in line with our expectations, but people just aren't full you know, they're just fully getting back out on the road, but I I suspect we will see you know, a a bit of a a small step change in in midweek route.
Chad Beynon: Thanks, Chris. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to ask about the dawn of the AgenTek AI AI. Obviously, the the first partners into those AI agents have been the online travel agencies booking TripAdvisor, etcetera. Are you talking to those agents? Would you be happy for an OTA to handle your distribution through those agents? And then maybe overall, do you see that development as as good or bad news for Hilton?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, we we obviously wanna, you know, deal with our customers as directly as we can. I mean, we do have a percentage of our business that comes through the OTAs. It's a relatively small percentage of the business. We have good relationships there. You know, the better they can serve that customer that we access, through them, the better for for everybody, the better experience is always what what what we want. And so you know, we think that's great. But the very large majority of our system is is is driven through our direct relationships. We want, obviously, for that to continue, we have done a huge amount of work in how we think about, you know, every element of the relation dream about a trip, to exploration of you know, how they where they wanna go to the booking if experience, to putting their package together, to pre-arrival, on stay, post-arrival, every element of it, and we're, you know, without getting into a great detail because it would take a whole day to do it. You know, we are super engaged in how we use tools and technology, including AI in every step of that journey, to make it a more pleasant and friction-free experience for our customers and so no, we don't plan to outsource that is the short answer. We're we're doing we're we're all over it. And I think, honestly, the work we're doing across the board, but particularly with the stay experience. Terms of being able to use AI from a data and analytics point of view to understand in great granular detail what individual customers want and then two. Mass customize the experience both ahead of the stay but particularly on stay. We have some really really interesting things going on in game change changing things there. And so we are fully committed to to pursuing continuing our pursuit of direct relationships with our customers.
Richard Clarke: Thanks Chris. Maybe just to to also follow-up on that. Could I conclude, therefore, that you would not allow you know, an OpenAI agent or a, you know, a Gemini agent to navigate to Hilton and make a booking on behalf of a customer. You're saying they would have to come direct to do that, not through a agent's AI.
Chris Nassetta: That that I I just said we may work directly with a number of those players. We would we will work directly with them. But what we're saying is we're we don't wanna work indirectly with some of those players.
Richard Clarke: Gotcha. Understood. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Dan Politzer: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to circle back on leisure a bit. Guys called out the strong occupancy trends particularly in December. Was that mostly in U.S.? Was it international? And then also, you know, can you maybe touch on if the it sounded like that was a bit lower lower rated than higher rated given the occupancy. And then know, just one one clarification for the first quarter. Anything to call out in terms of calendar, spring break, Easter, anything we should be aware of. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I think in the fourth quarter, it was pretty much everywhere headed on leisure and had you know, a lot to do with how the holidays fell. Now that impacts some regions more than others, but the holidays fell in a way that stimulated a lot of travel. By the way, it was across the board. It wasn't just low rated. It it you know, it volume wise would have been more low rate, but it stimulated all all all rate structures. Of leisure. And then it was the second part of the question. Holiday. Oh, holiday in the first quarter, you have Easter. The biggest impact is Easter.
Dan Politzer: Got it. Thanks so much.
Chris Nassetta: Otherwise, I mean, obviously, there's a lot of noise with what fires and storms and snow and all that, best we can tell you know, sadly, there's a lot of things that go on every year. There was enough of that going on in the first quarter of last year that it doesn't strike us yet that there's any real net impact. But Easter moving is is a net positive for Q1 and will be a net negative, obviously. For Q2. That's the primary driver of of guidance being a half a point ahead in Q1.
Dan Politzer: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from Conor Cunningham with Nellis Research. Please go ahead.
Conor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. So some positive comments on China today. So I'm just curious if you could kind of unpack that a little bit. I would imagine that within that low single-digit number that you talked about for twenty-five, the differences in first half or second half are pretty stark. So if you could just bridge that a little bit and then maybe touch a bit on on just development and signings and what's going on in the region in general. Thank you. Yeah.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Sure. For China, it was pretty consistent last year over the course of the year. It ended up sort of down five-ish for the year. I think it was down four in the fourth quarter is what I had in my prepared remarks. For this year, I don't have the quarterly spread exactly in front of me, but I think it's pretty consistent across the board. Low low single digits. And then development, we're doing great. In the in twenty twenty-four, our approvals were up our approvals in starts are both up ten percent, and our openings in China were up nearly thirty percent. And we continue to really well sort of across the board in in in chain scales in terms of demand for the product. So the slowdown you're seeing overall in real estate isn't affecting lodging as much. And in fact, lodging is, you know, our developers are a bit of a beneficiary from you know, hotels, particularly mid-market hotels, both in Hilton Garden Inn and our and and our master limited partnerships, being a good a good adaptive reuse for some of the Shell residential buildings and Shell office buildings that got developed and now need to find a different use in China. So low single-digit RevPAR that is, of course, on easier comps and we really know what GDP growth is gonna be in China this year? No. But we feel pretty good about you know, doing better on the fundamental side, and then we're doing great on the development side.
Chris Nassetta: The only other thing I'd add at China is Chinese are traveling like crazy. So there's the there's a whole outbound story, which is China has opened up visa-free zones into Asia. Visa-free zones. And so while we still expect China know, the sort of be tepid positive growth, but tepid as as Kevin just suggested. When you aggregate all the demand for travel coming out of China, it's super beneficial to our broader APAC business. So like Japan, Southeast Asia, they are huge. You know, Australasia to a degree, they're huge beneficiaries of a lot of outbound travel outside of China. That obviously has the the effect of of diminishing what's going on within China. But, you know, the good news about a big global diversified company like ours is we get to pick it up on the other side too.
Conor Cunningham: Appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks again everybody for joining us. We always appreciate the time, great questions. Hopefully, we gave you a little bit of context in addition to our prepared commentary. It's an interesting world, but we're as you heard, I'm super optimistic about obviously, very happy with how we finished out twenty-four and twenty-four overall. And optimistic as we go into twenty twenty-five. So we'll look forward to catching up with you after we finish the first quarter. Thanks again. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-10-23 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Head of Development Operations and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you. Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s third quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and-forward looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you. Jill. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Our third quarter results continued to demonstrate the strength of our business model as strong net unit growth helped drive solid bottom line performance. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS both exceeded the high end of our guidance, despite softer-than-expected RevPAR performance. We opened more hotel rooms than any other quarter in the history of our company and surpassed 8,000 hotels in our system. We also reached a milestone 200 million Hilton Honors members in the quarter, as our award-winning program, industry-leading brands and exceptional service continued to increase guest loyalty. Turning to results. Third quarter system-wide RevPAR increased 1.4% year-over-year, below our guidance range due to slower ramp in September following Labor Day, weather impacts, unfavorable calendar shifts and ongoing labor disputes in the US. Business transient RevPAR increased 2% with growth across both large corporates and small and medium-sized businesses. Leisure trends continue to normalize with RevPAR declining modestly from post-pandemic peaks. Group RevPAR was more than 5% year-over-year, led by strong demand for both corporate and social meetings and events. For the full year, group position is up 10% with group position in 2025 and 2026, up low double-digits to mid-teens. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, we estimate systemwide RevPAR grew at 2.3% in the quarter, just slightly softer than the second quarter and with all segments increasing. On an adjusted basis, leisure transient RevPAR increased nearly 2%, driven largely by solid trends across Continental Europe. In the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR growth largely in line with third quarter, driven by strong group bookings, continued business transient recovery and favorable calendar shifts, partially offset by the election and ongoing labor disputes in the U.S. Weekday pace for October is tracking up more than 300 basis points versus September's weekday pace, driven by solid business transient performance and group strength. Company meetings and convention business continue to grow as a percentage of mix driving longer booking windows. Given year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we expect forecast full year RevPAR growth of 2%, 2.5%, and full year adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately 10%, demonstrating the continued resiliency of our business model. Turning to development in the quarter. We opened a record 531 hotels, totaling more than 36,000 rooms, and achieved the highest net unit growth in our history at 7.8%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 8,000th hotel worldwide, our 900th hotel in Asia-Pacific and our 900th hotel in EMEA. Home2 Suites, which has more than doubled in supply in the last five years, opened its 700th hotel and continues to have the largest new development pipeline in the industry. We continue to expand our lifestyle portfolio, opening a number of new hotels in the quarter, including the Graduate Auburn and Graduate Princeton, the first two openings under our newly acquired Graduate brand. We also introduced several brands in new markets around the world, including Spark in Canada, Embassy Suites in UAE, Canopy in Japan and Hampton in Switzerland, demonstrating the strong value of our industry-leading brands and delivering for owners. We welcome nearly 400 luxury properties through our exclusive agreement with Small Luxury Hotels of the World. These properties, spanning 70 different countries, provide Honors members even more opportunities to book unique luxury experiences and sought-after destinations across the globe. Including SLH and our existing luxury properties, we now have one of the largest luxury hotel portfolios in the industry. Conversions accounted for 60% of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of SLH properties and continued momentum from Spark. We opened more than 20 Spark hotels in the quarter and now have over 6,000 Spark rooms in supply just a year after the brand opened its first property. Spark now has opened hotels in the US and the UK and Canada, and we recently announced plans to open hotels in Germany and Austria before the end of the year. The brand's pipeline is three times larger than its existing supply, and we expect continued launches in international markets to further boost Spark's trajectory, positioning us well for future growth in the premium economy space. In the quarter, we signed 28,000 rooms, expanding our pipeline to more than 492,000 rooms, which is up 8% year-over-year, excluding partnerships, our pipeline also increased from the second quarter. We signed three luxury deals in Greece, Japan and the UAE and 35 lifestyle properties, including a record 15 Curios. Conversions accounted for more than 30% of signings in the quarter, driven by the strength of Spark and continued momentum across Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. Construction starts remained strong, up 21%, excluding acquisitions and partnerships. We remain on track to exceed prior levels of starts by year-end with meaningful growth across both the US and international markets. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. As a result of our strong pipeline and under construction activity, we continue to expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year and 6% to 7% for 2025. We continue to be recognized for our culture and award-winning brands. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality workplace in Latin America and Asia by Great Place to Work, adding to the more than 560 Great Place to Work Awards and nearly 60 number one wins around the world since 2016. We're also proudly named the number two workplace on the 2024 People Magazine Companies That Care list and recently recognizes Time's Best Hotel Brand of 2024. Overall, we're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and the milestones we've achieved, our full network of brands to continue to be an engine of opportunity for our guests, our owners and our team members, we're excited about our growth into future. Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group. Adjusted EBITDA was $904 million in the third quarter, up 8% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected non-RevPAR fee growth, lower corporate expense and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 8% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.92. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR was up 1%, driven by a strong group performance. In the Americas outside of the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 4% year-over-year, driven by strong results in urban markets, particularly in Mexico. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year driven by key summer events, including the Olympics in France and the European soccer championships in Germany. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 3% year-over-year, led by occupancy gains in Qatar and Riyadh. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was down 3% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 4%, led by strong performance in India. However, China RevPAR declined 9% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons, disruptions due to typhoons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results. Turning to development. We ended the quarter with approximately 492,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 8% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside of the US and nearly half under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $804 million and $834 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.57 and $1.67. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 2.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $37 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $2.4 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning Chris, Kevin, Jill. Back in March at your Investor Day, which feels like a long time ago for a lot of different reasons, you gave a 2025 EBITDA target of $3.69 billion. When you look at that number and the drivers getting there, what's different about 2025 as you sit here today versus this past March? I guess, in other words, a few in the industry are in this 1% to 2% RevPAR growth range for next year. Do you still look at that level of EBITDA is achievable or do you need RevPAR to be somewhat higher than 1% to 2% to get there?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, that's a good question. Obviously, it's a tad early to be getting into 2025 guidance, as you know, we would typically do that at the end of -- when we report year end at the beginning of next year. But I will give you a high-level sense of it. I mean we are in the sort of early-ish stages of budget season, so lots of work to do. But I would say I have a reasonably -- like most things, I have a reasonably strong view of where I think things will end up. And so I'd start with sort of like how do we feel broadly about 2025 and I would say we feel pretty good about it. I've been doing this for longer than I'm going to admit, maybe close to 40 years. I've rarely seen sort of a stronger consensus view on the macro, particularly here in the U.S. But I think broadly -- and that macro view is sort of, I think, the word resiliency I used to describe our business. I think that word is getting used a lot to describe the economy. And I think there is a very broad consensus view that the economy will continue to be -- it obviously has been slowing because that's what the Fed has been trying to do here in the U.S. and to a degree, in other parts of the world, but focus on the U.S. But it remains strong, resilient, and showing positive growth. And I think our -- the consensus for you is that next year will be more of that, that we'll have positive economic growth. The odds of a recession at this point, I think, are quite low. If you look again at consensus view, I'm not an economist, but that's the view. And I talk to a lot of people, and I would generally agree with the view. So, I think as we think about as a backdrop, thinking about 2025, what's going to be the macro, which can drive a bunch of our business, obviously. We feel pretty good about it. I think when you think about how that's going to add up, and I'll sort of give you the punch line and then I'll break it down a little bit by regions and segments. I mean I think the punchline is my best sense, again, early in our budget season, is that next year is going to look a lot like this year from a same-store growth point of view. Now I think we'll get there a little bit differently. But I would say at this point, I think next year, we'll end up when we're sitting here a year from now, we'll be saying it felt a lot like 2024. If you break that down regionally, I think it's -- again, at a high level, where I think it ends up is the US ends up pretty similar to what we're experiencing this year. I think if you look at Asia-Pacific, I think it will be better in in part because comps China are going to get easier and there's a lot of stimulus occurring there. So I do think China will have a better year. And China -- I mean, APAC ex China remains quite strong, as Kevin suggested in his comments. And we don't see a lot that's going to disrupt that. And we have some comp benefits, particularly in the third quarter in weather in in typhoons Japan and China that will be a benefit. So, I think APAC will be better. I think EMEA will be a little bit less good than it's been. I think it's still going to be very good, to be clear. My guess is that it will probably still lead the pack in RevPAR growth in terms of our mega regions around the world. So it's not that I see a problem there. But I do think it will be somewhat less growth than we saw this year. And when you blend it all together, US about the same. APAC a little bit better. EMEA may be a little bit worse. I think you end up kind of about where you are. If you break it down by segments, again, I mean I'm homogenizing a lot of stuff together. But I think it's again a similar story, maybe with a little bit of nuance. I think on the group side, you're going to continue to see really good strength. I said we're up in the low to mid-teens in terms of our position going into next year, so we feel really good we'll cross over with more than half the business on the books. And booking windows are extending because there's just not enough supply relative to the demand. So I think you're going to see both demand growth and pricing growth in the group segment. I think in business transient, which will be, I think, in in second place terms of the pecking order of growth. Again, broadly, I think you're going to continue to see business transient grind up. I do think next year, we will likely surpass prior peaks of 2019 in terms of demand levels. So you will see increase in demand. All the anecdotal and hard evidence that we're getting from most of our big accounts and our SMB business suggests that, and you will continue to have good pricing power there. And then leisure, I think, again, a little bit like this year, you're going to continue to see normalization. What does that mean? That means, I think demand is sort of flat to maybe even down a little bit. But again, because like in all segments of life, particularly here in the US, inflation is down, but still stubbornly a bit high. I do believe that we'll continue to have very solid pricing power. So when you blend it all out, I think, again, it will look a lot like this year. I think it will, depending on the segment, be balanced, as I just described. But if you blend the whole world together, it will be a nice blend of both demand and pricing the way all that sort of -- all of what I just said amalgamates together. And listen, we spend a lot of time on this. We just did our, as we always do every quarter, our quarterly business review with the whole world. And everybody's in budget season and has got their head down. But I think the overarching sort of atmospherics with our teams around the world is consistent with what I just said, feeling pretty good. I mean, listen, we'd rather have higher RevPAR growth always, but we feel that, that's pretty solid. And the last thing to finish my pillar buster, thank you for the question, Joe, because I'm answering a bunch. We obviously feel really good about unit growth. We have given some guidance there. We've got a lot of momentum in that area. I'm sure we'll have more questions, but we feel very good about that. And so the way I would think about it is we're always trying to deliver algorithm growth, back to your initial question, which is I always say here, X plus Y needs to equal Z. So same store and unit growth need to add up. And I am very confident that algorithm will be alive and well for 2025.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning everyone. Chris, just maybe on the development side, given you just talked a lot about kind of what's going on in the kind of RevPAR and macro side. Can you just walk us through -- obviously, we now have the initial expectation of 6% to 7% for next year, a little bit more about what your kind of underlying assumption is there and sort of how it might factor in, possibilities of like what could -- maybe just walk us through what could be a little bit better if the development environment were to improve? Obviously, your starts remain really compelling, and what could be a little bit worse, just what would be the kind of range or bound of outcomes there? Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: I'll offer some comments, and Kevin runs development, so I should see to him, too. I mean I do think we feel, obviously, really good about 6% to 7%. We have more visibility into that than obviously the macro. We have a view on macro that's based, as I described on consensus. But we have good visibility. We've got a lot of stuff under construction. We have a lot of momentum on conversion. So the way I would say it is just a couple of points of clarification. One, the 6% to 7% is organic, that's not sort of incorporating partnerships, which is why this year's number is coming in higher than that at 7% to 7.5%. I would say implied in it is about a third of it would be conversions. That's about where we'll end up this year. By the way, if you take out the partnerships, we'll end up at about a third. If you add the partnerships in, we're about 50%. So -- but we don't, again, expect to repeat that. And that's how we get to it. Again, it's a super granular analysis other than in the year or for the year conversions, everything is identified, meaning it's in the pipeline. It's happening. And so it's really delivering on that one. And if it's going to deliver next year, it's pretty much got to be under construction right now or in the next. There may be a brand or two in a place or two around the world, including the US, where you could still start something, maybe with a LiveSmart right now or in the next 30 days and sneak it in next year, but it gets awfully hard. So in terms of the new build stuff, we have a good sense of that. Again, conversions, we have a good sense of a lot of those, because like Spark and others, they're in the pipeline, so. And then there's a segment of those conversions that are unidentified. We have a really good track record on delivering that. Obviously, those numbers at a third have been moving up. We've done more than that historically, but they've moved up from the low 20s to about a third. And we're taking a very disproportionate share of conversion opportunities around the world, and that's because our brands are performing really, really well, and we don't see any risk of that. So, what could make it like at the higher or lower end of the range, I think sort of intellectually the right way to say it is, maybe it has to be ultimately in the conversion space because of what I just said. I mean, maybe there's a few more that sneak under construction at the end of this year, but I don't think that's going to move the needle a whole heck of a lot. I think it's that we're more than a third in the conversions. I think that's possible. I'm not saying I think that'll happen, but I think that's possible. We give a range of six to seven for a reason that there's still a heck of a lot of work that Kevin and our development teams around the world have to do. I hope we make it look a little bit easy. It's not, but we feel really good about that range. And so, again, intellectually to do, you know, better or worse relative to the midpoint of that range is sort of conversions more or less.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. I guess maybe a follow-up on the NUG commentary, I guess how does the pipeline of what's in construction just from a fee-per-room mix compared to the existing base? And have you seen any change in the development as rates have started to come down here and lending has loosened?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'll take the second part first because it's a little bit easier. I think you are starting to see things free up a little bit in terms of the development environment as rates haven't come dramatically down, but they've come down a little bit. And I think people can see a path to a better day on the capital front. And we are actually starting to -- there's a lot more conversations around change of ownerships, which I think supports what Chris was just saying about conversions, because you've had -- as is normal for this part of the cycle, you've had pretty widespread between bid and ask on transactions, and transactions drive, as you know, a lot of conversions. And so we're starting to I think, see a little bit of a thawing in bid-ask spreads, which has led to more applications in the last 30 days or so on change of ownerships and things like that. We're starting to see a lot of -- more activity there, which bodes well. And then your first part, the fees per room, we're really not seeing any change. I mean, if you think about the complexion of what we're putting under construction and what we're delivering, it is still largely on an overall basis the same mix. So, we're not seeing dramatic changes in the mix. You're obviously seeing RevPAR growth over time. You're seeing mark-to-market on fees as contracts roll over. We continue to take price in terms of license fees a little bit, and the vast majority of our development actually is in the brand where we get the highest fees. And so when you put all that in the model, we're really not seeing a change in fees per room. And in fact, it will grow over time.
Stephen Grambling: Awesome. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: And the next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hi, Chris, just building on your point that you think kind of 2025 looks a lot like 2024. I would assume kind of RevPAR being the primary driver of that. Given the group pace that you guys currently have, and I believe you said low double-digits to low teens for 2025 and 2016 -- or sorry, 2025 and 2026. How do we interpret kind of the way you're thinking about leisure and business transient as we move into 2025 based on kind of what we know today?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, I would say and tried to cover it, but I'll click a little harder on it. In group, I think you're going to see a very balance -- you're going to see the highest growth rate. I mean I don't have the number -- I mean, we don't have a budget yet. But you see comparable growth. I mean, you heard the numbers we're talking about for like third quarter, up 5% or 6%. And I think you're going to be looking at that kind of level of growth in the group segment, if you look at the whole world. And I think that will be pretty balanced, as I said, between price and occupancy between rate and occupancy. I think in leisure, again, if you're solving for something in the 2s and that's at 5, I think this is transient ends up being sort of more in that range, again, with a balance, but if group is in the mid-single-digits, I think I think business transient is in the low single-digits, but higher than one. I mean, similar to this year, we're sort of trending at 2, low 2s, something like that. And then I think leisure, which again is, I think I said this, maybe I didn't, it's still trading way over historical levels. We don't think we'll go backwards. We don't think we're going backwards this year, but we think it's sort of flat. And so I would say my expectation, and I already said this, would be demand is flat, maybe even a little bit down as you continue to normalize the work environment and the like. But because you have pretty good pricing power and you still have inflationary pressures, particularly here, but in a lot of parts of the world, we feel like we'll be able to push rate a little bit. And so I would say we think leisure again, it's early, right? I don't have a budget in front of me, but we've talked a lot about it. I think leisure is positive, but not much positive. So I would say it's like very, very modestly positive. And when you put those three things together, that's really not that far off of sort of where we're ending up this year. I mean, I think that's why I say, I think when you finish 2025, at least sitting here today, it feels an awful lot like 2024.
Carlo Santarelli: I appreciate that Chris. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, you mentioned earlier that you're getting an outsized and it's obvious amount of conversions. Can you provide just a little bit of insight on how you're doing that? Is that just good old-fashioned shoe leather, any competition or whatever other euphemism? Or are there some specific drivers because we are obviously observing key money more carefully across the industry than usual, et cetera?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean, listen, Kevin may want to come over the top on this because he and his team are doing the shoe leather. I do think it's partly shoe leather. I mean, listen, I think we're -- say to our teams all the time, like our philosophy and how we run a company is we're pretty scrappy. We're pretty gritty. We don't take anything for granted. So we get our hustle. So, our teams hustle. I don't know what everybody else is doing, but we're hustling. We've built really good relationships. So a lot of this business, not all of it, particularly in Spark because they're bringing a bunch of new folks into the system, which are going to be hugely beneficial over time as we saw with Hampton decades ago. But we have really solid relationships where we've done a really good job with people and doing what they ultimately are looking for which leads to what I think is really driving it, which is performance. I mean you're signing up to these deals and not to be pedantic. But these are at the short end, generally very short end, 10. But more likely, these are 20-plus-year relationships that you're entering into with no real way out. And so these people are investing billions of dollars when you aggregate all of this development, even all the conversions, and they want to have confidence that when they're signing up, they're going to make money, but they're signing up for a long time that they've got the right system that they're signing up for. And so the truth is our track record is really good. Our brands are performing really well. Our market share is the highest it's ever been. It's significantly higher than any of our competitors. And so that doesn't mean we don't have to compete. I say the same all the time. For this cool like, why don't we win every deal? Why should we -- why are we only winning half the deals even though we're, whatever, 6% of the global market. I'll let Kevin explain himself on that. But getting half the business is pretty darn good. And I think it ultimately comes down to our ability over a long period of time to be able to deliver performance for owners because we can be witty, charming, scrappy gritty, we can be all the things we think we are or hope to be. But in the end, it's about performance. They're investing money in these assets or -- and this relationship with us to drive returns.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. Chris, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about how your visibility on business transient and leisure transient kind of compares to what it would have been in 2019? In other words, do you feel like you have more visibility or less visibility today? And then if I could squeeze 1 in for Kevin just on the comments about what drove better EBITDA than guide. I would love to hear about the non-RevPAR fees. And then also I think there was a timing benefit there as well. Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks Robin. I would say the answer is we don't have a tremendous amount of incremental visibility. The place we obviously have the most visibility is in group, which is why we give you those statistics. That business is pretty darn sticky. We have found recently and over a long span of time, people have needs, they still have pent-up needs. So, we feel really good about that. But leisure and transient, I mean, leisure transient, transient, business our visibility is limited, certainly limited to 60 or 90 days out. But then anecdotally, particularly with business transient, just talking to all of our customers, which we do all the time, our sales teams, I do, others in senior management to. We survey them. We do have data that tells us what they're thinking, and that gives us a rationale for what I'm saying to you I think will happen next year. But they haven't booked the business yet. Unlike groups where they booked it, they haven't booked it and then leisure where we have the least visibility into the future. Now, the reason I started my whole answer in my filibuster with the consensus view was obviously not lost on you or anybody else, particularly in leisure and business transient as it relates to how we think about next year, a lot of it so goes the economy to a degree, so goes those segments. So, that's why it always has to start with a view, a consensus view of like what the heck do we think is going to happen in the economy. It's not that the group business is immune to it. It's just stickier. It just -- it is not as immune to short-term swings overtime as the other segments. So, that's -- it's about -- I mean, have we gotten better, do we have better listening posts with our customers than we might have had five years ago? Yes, I think so. I think we're better at understanding what's going on. The reality in terms of booking visibility is about the same.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. And then on the -- Robin, on the non-RevPAR German fees, we were -- clearly, we were pleased with the performance. If RevPAR came in for all the reasons talked about under our expectations, the non-RevPAR-driven fees -- if you think about performance in the credit card business, in our purchasing business, things like that was all sort of above algorithm, if you will, above the overall rate of the business. And then on timing, it was about half the beat from the third quarter were timing items if you get behind it, and so that's about all I'd say about that.
Robin Farley: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask,
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Semdes.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Good morning. You talked a lot about just group going into next year, and it has been and continues to be. It looks like kind of a silver lining in the space. And I was just wondering when you look at what you're seeing now for 2025 group, I guess, particularly in the U.S., is there -- is it driven more by incremental citywide conventions? Is it more smaller groups that I think have been doing well for a while? Is there anything just kind of in particular that you could call out that's helping to drive that continued strength there?
Christopher Nassetta: I'd say it's a little bit of everything. If you think about what's going on, certainly, the big city-wides are picking up and not surprisingly. They just -- we've been saying this on every call. This takes longer in gestation to get those -- that business going because they book multiple years in advance. They spend millions of dollars planning these events. And they went for two or three years unwilling and/or unable to do that. And so we're certainly seeing wind in our sales from that. But we're also seeing really good social group business. I mean people still want to get out and see people. I mean, that is still a thing. And then I'd say corporate meetings are -- we're seeing really terrific demand. I mean even though the workplace is sort of normalizing somewhat, it is not going back to where was. And the reality is a lot of people have needs and that they're making -- sort of up for a time when they were more remote. They needed meetings for innovation and culture building and the like. And a lot of people have sort of changed pretty permanently, us included. By the way, our work environment a way where we take less space because people are more mobile, and it requires them needing space outside of their own office footprint more than historically they have. And so, that's a nice little wind in our sail as well. So that's a long-winded way of saying it's broad-based. I mean there's -- it's not one thing driving it.
Smedes Rose: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And our next question is from Lizzie Dove from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Lizzie Dove: Hi there. Thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to go back to the unit growth piece, which is obviously very strong. I believe the majority of the pipeline is coming from international just about. So, a little bit of a refresh of just where you see the key opportunities, the key markets driving that international expansion, maybe a refresh on the China piece as well with the stimulus. And just in any way that you kind of have to adapt your portfolio as you take those brands to different markets?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I mean, I guess the end, Lizzie, thanks for the question, is the easy part is, yes, you do have to adapt your brands and your prototypes and your room sizes and things like that, the markets around the world. They still maintain their essence and their positioning within the brand ladder and their swim wins and things like that, but you're obviously adapting them around the world. I think that sort of if you think about the complexity of the pipeline, it's about -- it's a little over half, call it, 55-or-so percent outside the US. The stuff that's under construction, just given the dynamics of some of the things that are going on around the world, our limited service business in China, things like that, it's about 80% of what's under construction is outside the US. Deliveries this year are going to be sort of more like the pipeline sort of think about it as mid-40s percent in the U.S. and 55% or so percent outside the U.S. I think the China business is doing great. We think both approval starts. I'm jumping around a little bit. But sorry, it was a broad question. Our approval starts and opens we think will all be up in China this year. We're -- even though there's a macro slowdown in China and you read a lot of headlines about real estate bubbles and the like in China. What's going on a lot in China is they're trying to find different uses for some of these buildings and some of the real estate that's been developed. And our business, particularly the limited service part of our business, both in our Master Limited partnerships and in our Hilton Garden Inn business is able to take advantage of a lot of the adaptive reuse of those businesses -- of those pieces of real estate. So -- and I think when you take a step back from it, though, I know you're relatively new to the coverage. But you've gone through the materials. And we outlined in our Investor Day, is kind of over the time period that we gave you for that. We think, call it, half of the NUG, 3 to 3.5 points will be in the Americas, 1-point or so will be in EMEA and 2 points will be in APAC. And that will move around a little bit year-to-year. But generally speaking, those will be the trends. And then you'll see in the Western world more conversions. In the developed world, more new builds. In Asia, we're shifting our business to APAC outside of China. So a lot of growth opportunities there, a lot of growth opportunities in India, a lot of growth opportunities in the Middle East. So, we're really seeing the benefit of a diversified set of products that we can deploy. And when certain parts of the world are strong, we can deploy in those parts of the world when certain parts slow down, diversification is a beautiful thing, and we're continuing to grow through it.
Lizzie Dove: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Good morning, everybody. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I'm curious on SLH. I know it's relatively new, but that's a big chunk of luxury hotels in your system on the website. People can earn and burn their points there. Curious how the early traction has been, if you've done anything sort of out of the norm in terms of marketing those hotels to loyalty members and how you're feeling about the start there.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean you're right, Brandt, it is super early, but in the sense that they just went in and sort of the middle end of the summer. And a lot of those properties are resorts in very unique locations that book way ahead of time. So, there's only so much data we have just given the time of year it came in. But the data that we do have is super good, meaning that our customers are engaging with it. They're looking at the availability of these properties. Now many of them this summer weren't available because they had already been booked given when they came in the system. They are -- where they did utilize it, they utilized it in a very healthy way for redemptions, which is exactly sort of the behavior set that we're looking for. And so I'd say obviously, a long way to go, but we feel very good about the ownership community and SLH feels very good about the start of the relationship. And I think as we get into the -- get a little bit of time, quarter or two and then certainly get into the spring and summer of next year, I think you'll see some real uptick. But you go in like if you go on our app, I had to do it. I was in Italy and Tuscany to meet some friends, where we have a few hotels go in the app and like hotels nearby me. And we went from having like three hotels to 40 hotels. So, -- and many of them are really small and very unique, but that's exactly what for a leisure, high-end leisure customer they're looking for. And so it really gives us significant enhancement in terms of shots on goal for people to book and importantly, for people to be able to dream that are road warriors and have a place to realize those dreams.
Brandt Montour: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Michael Bellisario from Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Mike.
Michael Bellisario: Chris, you sort of alluded to it, but just wanted to dig into RevPAR index and pipeline share a little bit more. Is it fair to assume that in a slower RevPAR backdrop that's maybe actually better for your business, at least on a relative basis? And then any similarities or differences that you see today compared to 2018 and 2019 when RevPAR was last in kind of stuck in first year? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, I mean it's interesting. I said earlier, so I don't want to contradict myself that obviously always like to see RevPAR higher. And so I will say it again, I'd always like to see it higher. But having said that, there are, and then you alluded to it in the approach to the question, there are benefits of the environment we're in. And we saw those benefits going back to that time where typically, we are able to deliver. If we do our jobs, better share in terms of performance on our existing assets. And we take in more difficult environments, environments where financing is less available, we end up disproportionately getting more conversions and more of what is available for new construction because our brands are just more financeable. And so that is certainly what we've been experiencing. If you look at the numbers across the board on development, whether you break it apart on new construction or conversions, you look at market share numbers, which continue, I mean, they're very high. So getting them -- they continue to grow. We've grown market share every single year in the eight, almost going on 18 years I've been here. So the higher you go, the harder it gets, but we're super focused on that. So I'm not giving you a specific answer because there isn't one, but this environment is not terrible for us in that way. And the really nice thing, as I think we demonstrated in the third quarter and we'll demonstrate for the full year, and I think we'll demonstrate again next year and the year after is the model is really resilient that even, I mean, think about it, even in the environment we're in where we're going to be in the twos on same store growth, we're going to deliver a circuit 10% EBITDA growth and higher than that in EPS and free cash flow. That doesn't -- I mean, that doesn't feel so bad. Imagine what can be done in an even better environment from a same store point of view. So that's not -- as I said, I know I'm not answering it specifically. But these conditions are -- we feel like whatever -- I guess I'd finalize it by saying we can't determine the macro. What we can do always is outperform competition. And so we feel good about in this environment, our ability to do that. We feel good about that. And our job is in every environment to do that, but we -- yes, and we will, but we feel we -- we're not -- this is not a terrible environment in terms of our ability to deliver.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Meredith Jensen from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Meredith Jensen: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about the occupancy and rate sort of offset. I know in the past you've spoken quite a bit about pushing rate. And I'm wondering how that conversation with franchisees and hotels have gone, shifted over the past few months? Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: It hasn't really shifted. I mean, obviously inflation is down broadly, use the US because it's our biggest market and we're here, sitting here in the US. And inflation is not running 8% to 10%, but it's still running four plus against the target of two, which I think personally will be a long time coming just because of the underlying strength in the broader economy. And one thing we didn't talk about yet is the basic fiscal spending between shifts and inflation reduction and infrastructure. You put all that stuff together, forget the private sector, there's a huge amount of public sector spending going on. And I think all of that sort of underpins growth and non-residential fixed investment, which drives a lot of demand in our business, which I think continues to give us a decent amount of rate integrity. And so our expectation is while that isn't -- is moderating from the hypercharge levels that you saw generally of inflation across a lot of sectors and we expect the same thing in ours, we still expect that there's a decent amount of pricing pressure. And so as we think about, by the way, we have very sophisticated revenue management models that it's not Christmas with its hand on the button deciding the rate of every room every night, thankfully. But we have very sophisticated systems. But those systems and all of our data scientists here at Hilton still believe that given those conditions in most segments at most times, there is good pricing integrity. The one area that I talked about where probably less by nature, if you think demand might be flat or going down a little bit as leisure normalizes, particularly on weekends, there may be a little bit less pressure there. But broadly, as I said, Mike, I think when we finish this year and next, I think leisure rates will be up. Not a lot, but I think leisure rates will be up just because of the underlying macro conditions. I don't know if that answered it, but the short answer is not nothing material that we see that's different in the last few months, certainly.
Meredith Jensen: Super helpful. Thanks a lot.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one, continuing on development, the guide for key money or contract acquisition costs at the beginning of the year, $250 million to $300 million, and that came down this quarter. Obviously, we only have two months left in the year, so you have a good sense of where things are from a key money standpoint. Kevin, I know this is something you guys highlighted at the Investor Day. But is this more of just a delay to 2025? Or is this just more progress in your goal to reduce key money as a percentage of NUG? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean, look, I think key money terms of percentage NUG and the more strategic bid, no change in our approach. I mean we still use key money on less than 10% of our deals. We use them when we have to when it gets competitive, but 90%-plus of the deals don't anything associated with them. It's just a little bit of timing, right? We're getting closer to the end of the year. We have more visibility into what we think is going to happen. A little bit of a couple of projects that we have in the works that we think are more likely to happen next year. And if you think about last year, was a bit heavier year because of some strategic projects. This year, it will be a little bit lighter. I think going forward, if you think about next year, probably somewhere in between last year and this year, but really no change in strategy.
Chad Beynon: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Morning. Kevin, a question for you. What are your ROI targets for brands, specifically developing them internally versus buying a brand? And then related to that, on these recent, I'd call them tuck-in brand acquisitions, are these initially accretive to earnings? Or if not, how long does it take for them to be accretive? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: No, I think, look, there's a lot there, Patrick, or we've talked about this a lot. I think when you think about, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions. So if you think about broadly alluded to sort of buy versus build. Obviously, the ROI is near infinite when we build these brands and build them over time organically into multibillion-dollar businesses. It's sort of you do a buy versus build analysis, but it almost always suggests build from a pure ROI perspective. And the last couple of deals we've done, they've been basically accretive out of the box, right? I think we -- we didn't -- we disclosed that on Graduate, if you'll recall from the press release that it's accretive out of the box. So, on both of these things, they were very specific to things we wanted to tuck in strategically. We're able to take advantage of a little bit of a distress in the environment to buy them really well and they were accretive right away, as I said.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you.\
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this now concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Chad, thanks. And to everybody that joined, thank you for the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world. But we're really happy with how the third quarter worked out. We feel good about the fourth and the full year. And as we've talked about quite a bit today, I feel good about the setup for 2025. We look forward to catching up with you after the years out and be a little bit more specific on 2025 at that point. And I hope everybody has a good end of the year and great holiday season when you get to it. It's funny to hear myself say that, but it's that time of year. Anyway, thanks again for the time today.
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-08-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Head of Development Operations and Investor Relations. You may begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s second quarter 2024 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you. Jill good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR growth driving adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance. We continued to execute on our successful development strategy and in July our system surpassed 8000 hotels globally. Our newly acquired brands and recent strategic partnerships will help us build even more loyalty with guests, further enhancing our network effect and increasing our industry leading RevPar premiums. Coupled with our asset light fee based business model, we are well positioned to continue producing significant free cash flow and driving meaningful shareholder returns in the quarter. In the quarter, system-wide, RevPAR increased 3.5% year-over-year above the midpoint of guidance due to robust group performance, continued recovery in business transient and easier holiday comparisons. Transient RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with increases in both business and leisure demand. RevPAR across large corporates rose 5% in the quarter, driven by strong trends across most industries, including notable recover in technology. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to exceed prior peaks, supported by solid summer travel demand, particularly in international markets. Group RevPAR rose more than 10% year-over-year, led by strong demand for corporate and social meetings and events and booking windows continued to lengthen. For the full year group position is up 10% over last year, with position up mid-teens over the next several years. We expect full year system-wide RevPAR to increase 2% to 3% driven by positive growth across all major segments and regions. We tempered the high end of our expectations versus prior guidance due to softer trends in certain international markets and normalizing leisure growth more broadly. With continued strength in group and steady recovery in business transient, we expect higher end chain scales to continue to outperform. Turning to development in the quarter, we opened 165 hotels totaling more than 22,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 6.2%. We marked several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 6000th hotel in North America, and we surpassed 75,000 home two suites rooms globally. We also opened seven new resort properties in Europe, including the debut of Curio in Croatia and DoubleTree in Malta. We welcome graduate hotels and NoMad into our family of brands during the quarter, providing further opportunities to deliver exceptional guest experiences and accelerate our expansion in the fast growing lifestyle segment. Demand for lifestyle products continues to increase as guests seek unique experiences and sought after destinations around the world. In the last year, we have expanded our lifestyle offerings by more than 30%, fueled largely by growth in Curio, Tapestry and the recent acquisition of Graduate. With roughly 400 lifestyle properties today and hundreds more in the pipeline, we are well positioned for substantial growth over the next several years. Conversions accounted for roughly half of openings in the quarter, driven by the addition of Graduate and the continued strength from DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, Spark opened 27 hotels, more than doubling its existing supply. The brand also celebrated its debut in Europe with the opening of Spark by Hilton London Romford, just nine months after the first property opened in the U.S. The opening marks the start of an exciting journey for Spark to redefine the premium economy segment in Europe, with further launches of the brand across Continental Europe expected in the coming months. In the quarter, we signed 63,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to approximately 508,000 rooms, which is up 8% from last quarter and 15% year-over-year, with notable strength across the EMEA and APAC regions. In particular, Hilton Garden Inn continued to gain tremendous traction with year-to-date signings, up nearly 90% across 20 different countries. Overall, conversions accounted for over half of the signings in the quarter, driven by additions from our acquisitions and partnerships. Excluding acquisitions and partnerships, conversions accounted for 25% of signings in the quarter, largely driven by continued momentum with Curio, Tapestry and DoubleTree. System-wide construction starts in the quarter were up 160% versus last year and up 37% excluding acquisitions and partnerships. With meaningful growth across both the U.S. and international markets, we remain on track to exceed prior peak levels of starts by year-end. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly four times our existing share of supply. We've seen tremendous interest from owners through our exclusive agreement with small luxury hotels of the world. With the pace of initial property signups far exceeding our expectations under our strategic partnership, we added nearly 300 boutique luxury properties to our system in July, with an additional 100 properties expected to join later this year. Adding these unique properties to our network is highly complementary to our existing luxury portfolio and significantly increases our luxury offerings for guests around the world without any capital commitment. During the quarter, the first AutoCamp properties were added to our platforms. Each AutoCamp location provides a unique opportunity for guests to immerse themselves in nature without sacrificing the comforts of high end accommodations. These exclusive agreements with SLH and AutoCamp provides Honors members with new and exciting ways to earn and redeem points while broadening and enhancing our network effect. As a result of our strong pipeline recent tuck-in acquisitions and strategic partnerships, we now expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5% for the full year. We are also proud to continue to be recognized for our industry leading brands and culture. Brand finance recently ranked Hilton as the most valuable hotel brand for the 9th consecutive year, claiming nine of the top 50 hotel brand spots. Additionally, Hilton was recently named the top workplace in the U.S. for millennials by Great Place to Work and Fortune for the 7th consecutive year. Since 2016, we've received over 540 recognitions as a Great Place to Work across more than 60 countries and we remain the number one great place to Work in the World and the United States. We're very happy with our second quarter results, development milestones and brand and commercial enhancements which we think demonstrate the continued strength of our business model. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results in the quarter and our expectations for the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery. Adjusted EBITDA was $917 million in the second quarter, up 13% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected U.S. RevPAR performance and some timing items. Management franchise fees grew 10% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items was $1.91. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was up 3%, driven by strong group performance, particularly in urban markets. In the Americas outside the U.S. second quarter, RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year, driven by strong results in leisure markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 7% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments and continued strength from international inbound travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year with growth in both rate and occupancy led by strong group and leisure performance. In the Asia Pacific region second quarter, RevPAR was up 1% year-over-year. RevPAR in APAC ex-China increased 11%, led by continued strength in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR declined 5% in the quarter with difficult year-over-year domestic travel comparisons and limited international inbound travel negatively affecting results, which weighed on RevPAR results for the region but accounts for less than 3% of overall fees. Turning to development, we ended the quarter with approximately 508,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 15% year-over-year, with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of 7% to 7.5%. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 3% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $875 million and $890 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.85. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.375 billion and $3.405 billion. We are bringing down the high end of our guidance to reflect slightly lower RevPAR growth expectations and FX movements. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.93 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate further share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $37 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter year. Year-to-date, we have returned nearly $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and for the full year we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question?
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you give us a little bit more detail. Obviously on the net rooms growth side of things. Chris and Kevin, clearly going to 7% to 7.5% is obviously a very good thing. Can you talk about what's added versus a quarter ago with particular attention with SLS and some of the newly acquired brands, as well as maybe what's different on a sort of organic same brand basis versus a quarter ago?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, I'd be happy to. I think the way to think about it is what's being added essentially is, is Graduate. I mean, if you look at our prior guidance, we had incorporated a guesstimate on what we would do for SLH. We are doing better than that. And so I think in the end that's going to probably be about a point and a half of NUG Graduate, which we said would be separate and apart is about a half a point. And so I think if you sort of unwind all that and compare it against prior guidance, the organic is slightly less, but has 100% to do with some things that are just moving from the fourth quarter into the, into the first quarter of next year. But as we were, as I said in my comments, in terms of feeling good about what's going on the development side, I mean, for the full year, we're going to hit historically high levels on signings. We're going to hit historically high levels on starts. And that is both of those, excluding any sort of partnerships or acquisitions. And obviously that's been translating into very good results. We feel very good about the momentum into next year. Most everybody was at our investor day in the spring where we articulated a sort of algorithm story of 6% to 7% organically. And we feel very, very good about being able to deliver on that. Obviously, this year is going to be above the higher end of that because of some of the inorganic things. But if we fast forward to next year, our expectation certainly is organically. We will be, we will be solidly in that range just given the signings, the starts and looking at how that's going to play out in the next couple of years.
Joe Greff: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will be from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey Chris, I think you addressed most of what I was going to ask, but at the end of your remarks there, you did talk about organic growth and the outline you laid out at the analyst day. When you think about contract acquisition spend over the next several years and acknowledging kind of that 6% net unit growth range. Should we be thinking something similar to what you've been spending in terms of contract acquisition spend this year to date, last, etcetera?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, last year was elevated because of a few very specific deals, which we've noted over the last couple of calls. This year will moderate and be lower than last year. And I think on a go-forward basis, I'd look at the next year as it sort of being comparable to where we'll end up this year. We're not really seeing any material difference. Notwithstanding a lot of noise in the market, I think in the quarter. Kevin helped me. We, our key money percentage of deals in second quarter was like 7% or 8%. Overall key money is still less than 10%. So 90 plus percent, fully free of any form of incentive. And we haven't really seen those stats really move around a whole lot. Again, we had an elevated year or two coming out of COVID because we got some really cool opportunities on some very big super high end luxury and sort of resort convention type assets. And we took advantage of that. But we're getting back to more normalized levels, which again will be lower than last year, this year. And I think we'll continue at that kind of level over the next two or three years.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks. And then you mentioned group pace plus ten for this year. And the outlook for the next few years you mentioned was mid-teens. In terms of 2025, 2026, what kind of percentage of your expected group room nights is on the books at present for 2025…
Christopher Nassetta: I don’t have the exact number in my head, but I would guess at this point, for 2025, it's probably 40% to 50%. And for 2026, it's probably a quarter, something like that. By the end of the year, we'll be for 2025, we'll probably cross over at 60% to 70%. Those would be sort of the typical numbers. And group is sort of getting back to pre-COVID typical levels. Like, even if you look in the second quarter group mix, it was pretty much at where we were pre-COVID. I mean, of overall mix in Q2 was 20%, which is exactly what it was, pre-COVID. So it's sort of, Group it's taken a while because of the long lead nature of it and planning and all that goes into it, particularly with the larger groups and the citywides. But that, that's sort of, now hitting on all cylinders and normalizing. So, yes, I would think it'd be in those percentages. So I think it's a, they're a very good indicator if we sit around this very table, with all of our senior team, including head of sales and his team, and they feel very good. They're not. There's no sense of sort of slowing on demand and pricing, and the group demand, pricing and overall attitude in that segment remains quite good, quite strong. And as I mentioned in the comments, the booking window is extending. I mean, our overall booking window extended in the quarter. And at this point, pretty much the booking window is back to, obviously got super short during COVID but it's pretty much now back to normalized level extended in the second quarter and pretty much got us back to pre-COVID levels. The Group booking window continues to extend just because people have to go further out. There's just not enough space available for their needs.
Carlo Santarelli: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: Morning, Chris. So, wanted to maybe just go high level and get a few of your views on the latest on the consumer engineering, maybe the broader macro. Obviously, a lot of cross currents out there. I think what we continue to see repeatedly is some softness and leisure at the margin in the U.S., contrasting that with the fairly solid corporate environment. But behaviorally, what caught your eye just operationally through the quarter as we got into maybe the summer travel season. What do you think is changing at the margin? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, a great question. And obviously we spent a lot of time talking to people and looking at a lot of data in our business. Let me do it maybe through the lens of walking around the world a little bit to talk about what's going on. So starting with maybe I'll finish at home, start with Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific, as you heard in Kevin's commentary, is sort of a tale of two cities, China and then APAC ex-China. So in China, I think Kevin covered it nicely. In China, there is actually a very significant amount of travel going on. We do expect to end the year sort of down probably circa 5%. But what's going on in China is obviously they have economic issues, so their economy is slow, but really the travel business is still quite robust. But what's happening is they've opened up a lot of corridors for inter Asia travel that is visa free. And Chinese travelers love to travel and they're getting out of China and they're going around and there's just not enough inbound travel yet into China. There's not enough flights from Europe and the U.S. and other parts of the world to compensate for that, and that's going to take time. I mean, I was there during the quarter at a U.S. China travel summit that the State Department sponsored with their equivalent, and we were talking about, how we're going to get, stimulate more travel, more flights. And by the way, the flights have tripled or quadrupled, even since then. So, I mean, there is progress, but it's still going to take some time. So I think, China is a complex story, but that's what's going on. People, travel in aggregate similar to where it was sort of not better or worse, but more people leaving, not enough coming in. I suspect over the next year or two, we will get to a different place. Hopefully their economy start to pick up, but you'll have a lot more inbound travel. The rest of Asia Pacific quite strong, particularly led by Korea and Japan. And we haven't seen any real signs of weakening in those markets. And I should say India, for that matter. No real signs of weakening. And those are the real APAC ex-China markets that are driving performance. And then coming to EMEA, again, sort of a bit of a tale to cities. The Middle East remains quite strong pretty much across the board. Europe, I would say, is still very, very strong in an absolute sense, but a touch weaker than what we had seen a quarter ago, led by what you're talking, implied in your question, which is some of the leisure business. Again, you're still at the high end of high single digit sort of year-over-year growth. So it's not like it's a it's not a bad story. It's just a little it's come off just a little bit. And then coming, coming, I could keep lots of other places in the world, but these are the big markets. It’s coming home to the U.S. is exactly what's implied and sort of what you would guess from what I've already said. If you break apart the segments, Group is still raging, business transient is still grinding up, not at a rapid pace, but still grinding up. Both of those segments maintaining great pricing power. And then leisure transient has been normalizing, because we're just getting back to a more normal life. And it was at very elevated levels, particularly on weekends, but broadly and so we continue to see sort of normalization there. And the consumer, if you break it apart, and sort of segments in the lower sort of half of consumers, maybe even the lower three quarters. I mean, you can read the data is all out there. They had bank accounts, and checking accounts full of money coming out of COVID. They've spent all that money. They're now borrowing more. And so, they have less available, less disposable income and capacity to do anything, including travel. You go up to the upper echelons and people still have pretty fat bank accounts and checking accounts and wherewithal. And so, what the impact of that is, some continued normalization on leisure transient. And the reason I use normalization is not to be cute. I mean, for the full year, if you look at it, we think we will globally see growth in all segments. I said that quickly in my prepared comments. It'll be very, very low in leisure transient, but positive a little bit, higher on business transient and then, very, very strong for the reasons I've described on meetings and events. So it is not, at least in our world and what we have seen year-to-date and what we expect for the rest of the year, it's not cratering in any way. It's just soft. It's but definitely softening for the reasons I described.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you so much.
Operator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hi, thanks. We'd love to hear some incremental detail on effectively the non-RevPAR related fees, both within the management and franchise fees, as well as the other revenue line, as we just think about, how the outlook has changed and any puts and takes to think about not only this year, but maybe longer term.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Stephen. I think, look, obviously, those -- the non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed. We still had very strong core fee growth in the quarter based on our algorithm but non-RevPAR-driven fees outperformed in the first half of the year. Some of that is a little bit of timing as it relates to the over the trajectory of the quarters of this year. And, but I'd say longer term, all of those parts of the business, right, we've talked about license fees. We've talked about other income. We've talked about ancillary lines of business at our Investor Day, all of those parts of the business should continue to grow at algorithm or above over time. So you're seeing a little bit of timing issues this year, but then over time, it should be additive to the algorithm overall.
Stephen Grambling: And just to clarify, are the timing issues just related to deals that were struck partnerships that were struck or just lapping over changes in terms?
Kevin Jacobs: Not on partnerships or deals just a little bit of comparability year-over-year and just a little bit of strength in the early part of the year in some of those parts of the business.
Stephen Grambling: Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: And -- I should say, a handful of onetime items in there, but nothing related to the partnerships.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And it's perfectly suited because I wanted to follow on to the prior one, which is related to non-RevPAR fees. Can you talk a bit about your ability to affect or influence that growth meaning is there just more resource toward identifying and executing on those opportunities? Or is the world just evolving in a way that's sort of driving that growth on your behalf which benefits from your scale?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean, being born to raise the control freak, nothing. I don't view anything is outside of some ability to have influence, not that maybe the broad macro, which we'll, I'm sure, talk more about at some point. So there are, David, a bunch of different things we can do. I'm not going to get into granular detail. But I mean you can see it in some of the actions that we publicly talk about like with our AmEx co-brand cards and the things that we're doing there to sort of reintroduce cards, change the benefits. And so I think I think the way you should look at it is, as Kevin described, we're in constant state of dialogue with all of our third-party partners on how to maximize these cards. We have a very serious seat at the table. We have lots of sort of contractual rights built into our relationship. But we also in the bulk of and particularly in our largest one with American Express have a long-standing and very close partnership. It's always in both of our interest to be making sure these things are performing. And so we both have dedicated teams in our companies, in the case of AmEx, we and they, but in our other partnerships that we have as well. And we have people literally grinding every day to figure out what or to figure out what the -- what we could do to modify the offer to customers to ultimately get them more to sign up in the case of co-brand and to enhance their desire to spend. We're in constant dialogue with like Hilton Grand Vacations. If you think about it, AmEx and HGV are probably the two biggest about the value proposition there. You can see in a very material way, we were deeply involved in the Bluegreen and Diamond acquisitions. Those were things that we worked on very closely with them to ultimately drive a much better outcome by effectively creating new brands within that space. So I can go on and on. The short answer is we don't leave anything for chance. I mean we're all over this stuff. We have rights, and we have great partnerships, and we are very aligned always trying to figure out how to modify programs and adjust the offers to customers to drive better outcomes.
David Katz: Super helpful. Lots more in this. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Hi, thanks. Just circling back to the unit growth guide for next year. You have -- I think it's something like 30% more rooms under construction than you did in 2019 if my math is right. So you don't really necessarily need an acceleration in conversions, but some others are talking about that. I wonder if you could just sort of characterize what you think is going on in the conversion environment in terms of are there things that would drive that to accelerate in 2025 or -- for [indiscernible]
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean I agree. -- that's why I feel good about being in the 6% to 7% range. I mean, effectively, if you take out all the partnerships and everything, it is by being solidly in that range, it is accelerating. So it is organically reflective of the strength conversions, we do think are accelerating. I mean, for the full year, we're going to have conversions over 50%. But again, that's in part driven by partnerships, acquisition and partnership. If you strip all of that stuff out conversions are going to go from like 30% to just under 40%. So we are having great success in conversions. We believe strongly that has everything to do with the strength of our brands and the strength of our commercial engines driving better outcomes for our owners. And so we are getting a hugely disproportionate share of conversions. And if we do our job, which we intend to do, we think that will continue. So being solidly in 6% to 7% next year, it is reflective of the benefit of the acceleration we're seeing in signing starts, conversions, all of that baked in. It's obviously a little bit early in that it's August to give the number -- to give a tighter range. But as we get closer to it, we will, but we feel very comfortable being solidly in that range.
Robin Farley: Great. It's very helpful. And then if I could, just one clarification. Kevin's comments on kind of the timing of fee growth and that the first half outperformed and the idea that it will -- over time, it will -- that sort of algorithm is sustained. Just does that mean like sort of for the full year, the algorithm will be the same? Or was that more that like I'm just thinking about it in second half would be slightly below algorithm, but the full year still comes in, in line or with the comment that...
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. If you look at our guidance that is what is implied. I mean we -- the first part of the year in terms of -- I don't know what metric you're looking at. But if you just look at EBITDA growth, it will be higher in the first half of the year because of some of the stuff that Kevin was talking about on timing. As a result, it will be lower. But for the full year, it will be in the ranges we talked about, which when I rounded is sort of like EBITDA growth of 10%. I mean, I think -- and I'm patting us on the back, but I guess that's my job. I mean when I think about what's going on in the world and our ability to do that, I think it's striking. The reality is, as much as I said, I'm a control freak, and I wish we could control everything. We don't control the macro. You know that better than we do. And the macro environment is weakening a touch, okay? That's just what's going on, not dramatically so, but it's weakening a touch thus, why we brought the top end of our RevPAR guidance down and the top have shaved a little bit of the top end of our EBITDA guidance. Frankly, a lot of that shape had to do with FX changes honestly. If you take out FX, it didn't really move a whole lot from an EBITDA point of view. But even in the face of all that, at the same time that RevPAR, the midpoint of RevPAR is coming down, the midpoint of unit growth is going up, and the result is pretty much the same, which is if you think about back to Investor Day, we said we're going to deliver plus or minus 10% EBITDA growth on average, we’re going to do it even in an environment that I would argue from a macro point of view is not super strong and softening a touch because of the success that we're having in executing what I think is a very thoughtful plan and strategy on the development side, we are still getting to circa 10% EBITDA growth in that environment. And I think that is a demonstration, both of the resilience of the core business and the model, and this is the pat us on the back, and I'm patting Kevin on the back as he runs this development, the success that we're having in what is a really good development strategy being super well executed.
Robin Farley: Great. Perfect, thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Just I guess to follow up on the growth outlook a little bit. Just looking at sort of the implied RevPAR ranges at kind of one and change to three and change through the back half of the year. I mean, is the higher end just a reflection of maybe what happens with the U.S. economic growth? Or is there something else in particular that you think could drive you towards the higher end of that implied outlook?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean it implies 2% to 3% really for both quarters, Smedes. I think if you think about it, if you look at what's going on so far in the third quarter, it has been a touch softer. And as we get into the fourth quarter, the expectation would be as the bigger business travel months of October and the first part of November kick in, particularly in the U.S., that there would be a little bit of strengthening in RevPAR growth. As supported by -- also by, I should mention by our group position. So if you think about that and then if you think about the mix of the business, we still are largely 70% plus or minus of our revenue comes from the United States. And so what happens in the U.S. will be a driver, but supported by our group position supported by strength in the bigger group hotels in the urban markets, we think -- and what we think will be stronger business travel in the early part of the fourth quarter, that's kind of what's playing out over the balance sheet here.
Smedes Rose: Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: And the next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Brandt Montour: Good morning. So Chris and Kevin, so implied in the fact that EBITDA, the guidance for the full year didn't really come down but you did cut RevPAR, we're left to assume that there's some incremental fees potentially from that extra NUG from SLH. Correct me if I'm wrong there. But the follow-on question is, if you could just remind us the economics of the SLH hotels and what you're implying to sort of accruing fees from them as we go through the rest of the year?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think your implication is right. Some of it is fees doing better in SLA. Some of it's non-RevPAR fees doing better. And the way to think about economics on SLH's we get sort of normal fees relative to what we would get a typical franchise arrangement. But for the fact that we get paid on the business we generate there versus 100% of revenues. Now recognize that the average rate of these hotels is probably 5 times to 7 times -- 6 times or 7 times our system-wide average rate. So in the end, we feel very good about the economics.
Brandt Montour: Okay. That's super helpful. And then the follow-on question is just a clarification on some of your comments, Kevin, on the back half RevPAR I know U.S. is the big one, but U.S. and China may be taken separately, what are you implying for the back half on those two buckets versus the July run rate? Are you implying any reacceleration or sort of straight lining or what's qualitatively what you guys are thinking there?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean, we didn't -- we haven't given a July run rate for us. But if you look at what's going on in the industry, it does imply an acceleration in the back half of the year relative to July, if that's your specific question.
Christopher Nassetta: And I think that acceleration, Kevin said this, Brant would be fourth quarter oriented. I think third quarter, you will likely see -- you're in a transition where leisure is softer and you don't have all the business travel and the meetings and events. So third quarter, if you look at it, third versus fourth. I think third quarter will be weaker, fourth quarter a lot stronger for the reasons Kevin described. One, we end -- we fully expect a more normalized business transient travel, particularly as you get a week or so past Labor Day. And in October, November, it will get cooking, and we have a very strong group base in the fourth quarter that supports a stronger fourth quarter than third.
Brandt Montour: Perfect. Thanks everyone.
Operator: And the next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hello good morning everyone.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Have you seen any impact on ADR growth or even customer demand from bundling the hotel rate and the resort or amenity fees into a single rate quote? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: No, not yet. I think, look, it's sort of early days on sort of those changes. But I mean, really, in the end, that's about more transparency, and we do not see any impact to AV. We have not seen any impact nor do we expect any from that change.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. And a follow-up question may for Kevin. You folks have done exceptionally well with EBITDA margin expansion really far and away the best in my coverage universe since 2019. Any high-level thoughts about how much more room you have to go? Or how should we think about potential for EBITDA margin growth over the next several years. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, thanks for the question, Patrick. We appreciate that because we think it's been a very good story. We talked about this a little bit at the Investor Day, but for those who weren't there or need a reminder, we think there's 50 to 100 basis points a year of embedded margin growth increases in the business as we shift, obviously, the growth in the business is all through the fee segment. So those fees come in at 100% margin and improve the margins of the business. And so that, combined with really good cost control, which I think we have like Chris said earlier, I think we'll pat ourselves on the back a little bit on that. I think we're really good about being disciplined about cost control. And so what that's done is you can see our margins are 1,000 basis points higher than they were pre-COVID, and we think that, that will continue to grow. Again, there will be different there'll be puts and takes depending on what's going on in the economy and how we do and where we are relative to our annual algorithm projections. But for the most part, you should think about it as 50 to 100 basis points -- embedded growth.
Christopher Nassetta: And some years there'll be better somewhere. This is going to be a year that's best. So I think we will -- we expect to be over 100 basis points in EBITDA margin growth this year.
Patrick Scholes: Okay, thank you for the clarity.
Operator: And the next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to focus on conversions, which for you guys and a lot of your peers are just becoming a bigger component of net unit growth? And maybe said differently, more predictable piece. So as you think about the net unit growth beyond in 2025 and 2026 and some of the new brands that you've rolled out, which are helping on conversions, should this lift just in terms of percentage of NUG. And how does the cycle play into that with rates coming down? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. It's a really good question. I think it's obviously a bit of both. I mean we've had years in the past. This is the part of the cycle where particularly when capital gets more constrained and more expensive for new builds. And this is the part of the cycle where you typically lead into conversions because they're just easier to finance. You've got a trading hotel, you've got -- it's cash flowing. We are obviously leaning in to our lifestyle brands, which our soft brands tend to be more driven towards conversions. Spark is a 100% conversion brand. So we are doing things strategically to increase our share of conversion. So I think it's both. I think it's -- part of it's cyclical in nature. You said -- like I said, you've seen times when conversions have been a bigger part of the story. This is a part of that cycle. But some of these are like, I don't want to say permanent, but sort of semi-permanently we're doing things strategically to focus on being able to take share, and we're doing it. I think I think last year for the full year, we were something like 40% of the conversion deals done in the entire U.S. We're higher than that so far this year. And so our -- the network effect we create, the RevPAR next we drive the fact that our brands are stronger and the fact that we're strategically focusing on it, I think should mean that it's additive to the overall growth trajectory of the company over time rather than just being cyclical, but cyclicality matters as well.
Chad Beynon: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey good morning. Thank you. Just on Spark, you mentioned 27 hotels. Any themes in terms of the brands or types of properties that are converting from and what the average investment by owners is? And then my follow-up on the 400 SLH, generally, where are they located? And any more detail you can offer about the profile of these properties coming in as well? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. So I'll take the first part, I would say, on Spark, is everything is going the way we thought and the way it's planned. I mean, 95-plus percent of them are from third-party brands. I think I'm not going to get into specifically which brands those are from, but I think people can figure that out, and it's been sort of what we've expected. And the owner investment is coming in, in line with what we thought. There have been a little bit of increases in construction costs as has been well documented in the industry, but still coming in within the ranges. And then so far, early days, the RevPAR index, the performance of the hotels has been quite strong and again, maybe even a little bit better than what we've expected, which is creating momentum in that area. And then SLH breaks down 60% in EMEA, 20% in the Americas and 20% in Asia Pacific. And I'd say that they're small hotels, by definition, small luxury hotels. I think on average, they're 45 rooms to 50 rooms, something like that. As we've talked about, really unique properties in really high rated, high RevPAR markets, and that's all been -- I think the pace of people signing up has been better than we thought, but the profile is exactly what we thought when we went into it.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Dan Politzer from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Dan Politzer: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on China. I believe you said that China was 30% of overall fees. I assume that over indexes in terms of the incentive management fees. But how should we think about that relative to that line item? And maybe any guide guardrails for incentive management fees as we think about the rest of the year and as it relates to China.
Kevin Jacobs: No. I think, look, for China, it doesn't -- it's no different than our normal fee structure. If we manage -- it's basically off the top and a percentage of GOP at the bottom. So that's not really different than any of our other international management agreements. And then now we're growing a big franchise business now in China. So that's just straight franchise fees, right? 5%-ish franchise fees off the top. And so that's really the fee composition in China is really in line with the broader business. And then for IMF, there's a couple of things going on with IMF. This maybe isn't exactly what you asked, but we've got a little bit of FX. We've got a couple of contracts that converted from management to franchise sort of at the same economics. So you're just seeing some shifts from 1 IMF segment to the other. If you adjust for those two factors and a couple of timing items IMF would be sort of low double-digit growth for the year, so a little bit better than the overall business, and it's, I think, 9% or 10% of fees. So nothing much really going on there.
Dan Politzer: Thank you. Helpful.
Operator: And our next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just looking at some of the other regions like Middle East and Africa, Asia, ex-China, the ones that are really delivering the double-digit growth at the moment. Just your outlook for that for the second half. Can they keep that pace of momentum? Or are we going to sort of see a convergence of global RevPAR around your guidance number?
Christopher Nassetta: No, I think we feel good about the second half in those regions that are really performing at that level. As I was trying to say when I did my little around the world exercise, we do think there's softening in certain segments, in certain parts of the world for the reasons I described. But not we think APAC ex-China is going to have a very good second half of the year. We think Middle East Africa will as well in those two cases. And those are the two that are really at the highest levels of RevPAR performance.
Richard Clarke: And then maybe just a clarification. Maybe this is related to your previous comment, Kevin. But I noticed that think about 1,000 Waldorf Astoria rooms have left the system and about 300 Conrad. I guess that's probably Edinburgh and the New York one. But just any color around those hotels leaving the system and what it means for those brands.
Kevin Jacobs: No. I mean the -- we had a couple of Waldorfs that we converted to actually stayed in the system and converted to different brands. These are a couple of the hotels that have been in Waldorf for a long time kind of going back to when Waldorf was more of a collection brand than sort of the brand it is today. And so other than the one you mentioned in New York, the Waldorf that shifted out have stayed in the system and they're now -- one is an LXR and two of them are Curios.
Christopher Nassetta: And that was at our urging, with what we're strategically trying to do with Waldorf, if you think about all the existing Waldorf, the new [Indiscernible] that are coming. Waldorf is really hitting on all cylinders. The product is extraordinary. The new products are off the charts. And so there are like any brand that's been around for a while, there are some that really don't quite fit the bill. But the good news is with 24 brands, we have a home for -- not for everything, but we have a home for those things. And those properties that that left Walter are terrific properties that just weren't sort of meeting the mark on Waldorf, but they met the mark in other brands.
Richard Clarke: Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Kevin Kopelman: Well thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick housekeeping. The first one is on your FX assumption. Is it safe to assume that, that was set before the U.S. dollar kind of started weakening on Friday? And then the second one was, if you could -- could you give us pipeline approvals in the second quarter ex-Graduate? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. So the first one, the answer is no. I mean, technically, our forecast was set before Friday, but I don't think the Friday's move is going to have a material effect on the full year for FX. It's just it did -- as we mentioned. It did get a little bit worse over the -- become a little bit more of a headwind over the course of the quarter, which affected our guidance range for the full year. And then sorry, the second part of your question?
Kevin Kopelman: The second one was just you had that huge approvals number. I think some of it was maybe incorporating graduate hotels, but I know underlying was also strong. If you could just give us pipeline approvals ex-Graduate.
Christopher Nassetta: We gave it -- it's in the press.
Kevin Jacobs: It's in the press release.
Christopher Nassetta: 4,000 and change.
Kevin Jacobs: And you're right. It does incorporate both momentum in the existing brands and the new stuff. I'd say that's pretty strong.
Kevin Kopelman: Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.
Conor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Just on the conversations with developers, I'm just curious on how that's changed over the past six months. I assume that there's a lot more comfortability around financing and credit availability. And then another one, just Airbnb called out booking presentation on just longer-term rentals. I mean, I realize your extended stay business is not exactly the same. But are you seeing any hesitancy on the longer but curve stuff in general? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. No, the second part is easy. We're not. And I think I'm not going to comment on what Airbnb said, and you haven't had a ton of time to study what they said, but that's a very different business. The composition of their business, 90%, 95% leisure all long-term stay. So I'll let them comment on that part of the business. We're not seeing any changes. And Chris even talked about booking windows normalizing and things like that earlier in the call. So nothing there. And then sorry, the first part was...
Conor Cunningham: Just on the evolution of your discussions with developers. It seems like -- yes.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I'd say they're largely consistent. I mean developers remain excited about the future for travel and the setup I think that overall capital is a little bit less expensive than it was, right? It's coming off of peaks. I think there's an expectation that it will come down there is -- it is a more constrained credit environment based on the lending community's views of the macro and what they're worried about is going to happen. But there's still capital available for good projects, which is why you're seeing our construction starts go up. And we're taking share in environments where capital is more constrained. We've said this a bunch of times, but rising tides lift all boats when the tide is going out, the stronger brands that are -- that lenders have more confidence lending to and developers have more confidence affiliating their hotels with are going to take share, and that's what's happening.
Conor Cunningham: Appreciate, thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you, as always, for spending an hour of your day with us. Obviously, we're super pleased with being able to deliver on second quarter, and we feel very good about our outlook for the full year, as I described, while the macro environment is a little bit weaker. Our development story is incrementally stronger and the net result is pretty much our ability to deliver an algorithm, which we're excited about. We will look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter to give you the latest and greatest. And hope everybody enjoys what you can on the rest of summer. Take care, and thanks.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-04-24 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin. 
Jill Chapman: Thank you, MJ. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.
 In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.
 This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.
 With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. 
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report strong first quarter results, which continue to demonstrate the power of our business model and the strength of our development story, both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS meaningfully exceeded the high end of our guidance even with RevPAR growth at the low end of our expected range. We also announced several new partnerships and additions to our brand portfolio, which will enable us to build even more loyalty with customers and help accelerate growth.
 Turning results for the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 2% year-over-year, which was at the low end of our guidance range as renovations, inclement weather and unfavorable holiday shifts weighed on results more than we anticipated. Leisure transient RevPAR exceeded our expectations even with tough year-over-year comparisons given continued strength in international markets and holiday shifts, business transient recovery remained steady with RevPAR across large corporates, up more than 3%, driven by strong demand in consulting and government contracting. Group RevPAR rose nearly 5% year-over-year, led by strong convention and social demand. Additionally, corporate groups continue to grow as a percentage of booking mix and booking windows continue to lengthen.
 As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%, with the U.S. towards the low end of the range and continued strength in international markets. We expect positive RevPAR growth across all major segments, led by group performance at or above the high end of the range, business transient around the midpoint and leisure transient towards the lower end of the range. For the full year, group position is up 13% versus last year.
 Turning to development. We started the year off strong, building on the positive momentum from 2023. In the quarter, we opened more than 100 hotels totaling approximately 17,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.6%. Hotel openings span nearly all brands, demonstrating the strength and breadth of our industry-leading brand portfolio. Conversions accounted for 30% of openings, largely driven by DoubleTree and Spark. In the quarter, we celebrated the addition of a number of new luxury and lifestyle properties, including the debut of LXR in Hawaii, the introduction of the Waldorf and Canopy brands to the Seychelles and the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Orlando.
 Located within the newly developed Evermore Orlando Resort complex, the Conrad Orlando features 5 distinct dining venues, an 8-acre lagoon and expansive pool complex, a world-class spa and extensive meeting and event space. We also achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 800th hotel in Asia Pacific, our 225th hotel in the CALA region and reached 25,000 true rooms globally. Additionally, Hampton opened its 3,000th property worldwide. Since its launch 40 years ago, the Hampton brand has been a category leader with the largest global pipeline of any focused service brand and the recently announced new North American prototype. Hampton continues to demonstrate the strength of our legacy brands and the power of our innovative approach to brand evolution, we are confident that the best is yet to come for this iconic brand.
 In the quarter, we signed 30,000 rooms, increasing our pipeline to a record 472,000 rooms, up 2% from last quarter and up 10% year-over-year. Signings meaningfully outperformed our expectations driven by strength in international markets. In Asia Pacific, we signed agreements for 4 new Conrad properties, further strengthening our luxury pipeline. Globally, an interest in Hilton Garden Inn remained particularly strong with the brand achieving the highest quarter of signings in its history. System-wide construction starts also outperformed expectations, up roughly 45% versus last year, with all major regions meaningfully higher. Approximately half of our pipeline is under construction and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company, accounting for more than 20% of industry share and nearly 4x our share of existing supply.
 We also recently announced several exciting partnerships and tuck-in acquisitions, further accelerating our expansion into the fast-growing lifestyle and experiences categories. Earlier this month, we acquired a controlling interest in Sydell Group to expand the NoMad brand from its existing London flagship location to high-end markets all around the world. Our development teams are fully engaged and we have a great pipeline building. Additionally, we announced an agreement with AJ Capital to acquire the Graduate Hotels brand, a collection of over 30 lifestyle hotels in university anchored towns, each Graduate Hotel, steeped in local history charm and nostalgia and designed to reflect the unique character of its local university, offering the perfect setting for game-based graduations, reunions and campus visits.
 Graduate presents a unique opportunity to serve more guests, especially in markets where we're not present today. With thousands of colleges and universities around the world, we believe the addressable market for the brand is 400 to 500 hotels globally. For the rapidly increasing number of travelers looking to prioritize exploration and adventure, we recently announced an exclusive partnership with the premier outdoor hospitality company, AutoCamp. Stays will be bookable on Hilton's direct channels in the coming months, and we will offer our guests an experience that blends the spirit of an outdoor adventure with the hospitality and design forward nicking of a boutique hotel.
 Hilton Honors members will be able to earn and redeem points on stays and enjoy exclusive membership benefits while experiencing sought-after locations around the United States, including several properties adjacent to popular national parks. Along with our previously announced exclusive partnership with small luxury hotels of the world, these offerings provide incredible opportunities to further accelerate our growth and enhance our network effect by broadening and deepening our customer offerings in some of the industry's fastest-growing markets and segments. As a result of our strong pipeline and all the great progress we've seen to date for the full year, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned addition of Graduate.
 To provide even more personalized experiences for our guests, we continue to leverage our industry-leading technology platforms from a digitally enabled concierge for our luxury brands, to the ability to choose your room from a floor plan and control your in-room entertainment from your mobile device. We continue to fully integrate the digital experience. Additionally, recent initiatives like add-ons Hilton for Business and improved search functionality are driving even greater conversion and higher revenue.
 We also continue to be recognized for our incredible workplace culture, Fortune and Great Place to Work recently named Hilton, the #1 on the list of best companies to work for in the United States, marking our ninth consecutive year on the list, and our sixth consecutive year in the top 10. In total, we won 20 Great Place to Work awards around the world with 5 #1 wins. These recognitions follow our ranking as the #1 world's best workplace and make Hilton the only hospitality company to have earned the top spot on these prestigious lists.
 Overall, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, and we expect our industry-leading brands, strong development story and powerful business model to continue to drive growth. Now I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year. 
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was largely driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group.
 Adjusted EBITDA was $750 million in the first quarter, up 17% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected international RevPAR performance, license fee growth and timing items. Management and franchise fees grew 14% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.53.
 Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR was down 40 basis points year-over-year as renovations, holiday shifts and weather impacts dampened transient trends. Group performance remains strong. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with strong transient demand driving RevPAR growth of 10% in urban markets. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. A number of large events in the region drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 15% year-over-year, led by both rate and occupancy growth. Several prominent events, including the Asian Cup in Qatar and holidays in Saudi Arabia contributed to strong performance in the region.
 In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 8% year-over-year, led by rate growth in Japan and Korea. China RevPAR was flat in the quarter with strong results in January and February, offset by difficult year-over-year comparisons in March. RevPAR in China's top cities increased 6% in the quarter, but an uptick in outbound travel pressured demand in secondary and tertiary markets, which benefited early in recovery from strong domestic travel.
 Turning to development. We ended the quarter with more than 472,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 10% year-over-year with approximately 60% of those rooms located outside the U.S. and nearly half of them under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we expect net unit growth of 6% to 6.5%, excluding the planned acquisition of Graduate Hotels.
 Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $890 million and $910 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.80 and $1.86. For full year 2024, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA between $3.375 billion and $3.425 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.89 and $7.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases or any contribution from Graduate Hotels which we expect to close in the second quarter.
 Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $900 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And for the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings results we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.
 We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please? 
Operator: Of course, the first question today comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. 
Stephen Grambling: I just touch on the guidance in the first quarter. It seems like, clearly, some positive commentary in there. I just want to make sure I'm clear. I guess, when you put it all in the blender, if you will, what's really change in your mind as you look at the back half of the year and take into account what you've seen in the first quarter, both as it relates to development versus some of the deals you've made and then also what you're seeing on RevPAR. 
Christopher Nassetta: Sure. Happy to cover that. That's a broad array of topic so really -- really artful questions, Stephen. I would say when you flush it all out, obviously, and Kevin covered it in his prepared comments, the first quarter from a RevPAR point of view is a little bit lighter than we thought, but sort of easily explained on the basis of what Kevin already talked about. We had a lot more under construction than we had anticipated, which is a good thing, but not enough rooms out of inventory in a lot of those assets, particularly in our limited service brands to take it out of the comp set. So that weighed on is weather, definitely, we didn't anticipate what was going on -- what happened in the Northeast at the beginning of the year.
 And then while we certainly knew about the holiday shift of Easter moving in. It was a little more impactful and spring break sort of ended up being like a rolling 4 weeks of spring break. And so we underestimated that. As we think about the full year, the way to think -- the way I think about our outlook is the way I think most people are thinking about the broader economy, and that is the broader economy is reasonably strong. It seems to be very resilient. Obviously, employment numbers are quite good. Corporate profits, it depends on the industry, are still quite strong. And so as we sort of factor for that for the rest of the year and we think about the various segments, it leads us to feel about the way we did when we talked to you last time. Meaning if we look at the big segments, the group business is still incredibly strong. The demand is great. Every month that goes by, it's very strong. 
 While the first quarter was certainly choppy because of the movement of the holiday and all that. When you talk to customers, which we do all the time and I do, I think you get a very positive view about there are people traveling more for business transient. And because the economy has been resilient and employment has been strong, I think it helps with the underpinning, while leisure certainly is normalizing from super high levels. It gives you, I think, a reasonable amount of confidence that it's still going to be relatively strong, modest growth, mostly in the form of rate because we continue to have a decent amount of pricing power. And so when you sort of like put that all in the gonculator and spit it out at the end of the day, from a RevPAR from a top line point of view, that's why we maintained our guidance. First quarter, a little bit more choppy, but the reality is some of that reverses because of the holiday shift, we'll get the benefit in the second quarter, and we feel about the same based on a pretty consistent consensus view that the economy is going to maintain relative strength.
 On the development side, between Kevin's and my comments, you heard, I mean, we feel like we have a lot of momentum. I said it on the last call, that I think we were on the slope up. And I said -- and we said it at our Investor Day that over the next few years, we think we'll be at 6% to 7% in NUG, that's where we think we're going to be and the reality is we had strong expectations carrying over momentum from the end of the year, but it was better in terms of signings and starts and openings, frankly, that a little bit than we thought. And so as we look at the year and we look around the world and work with our development teams. I mean the reality is we think we're going to sign more deals than we've ever signed, and we're going to start more deals and more hotels under construction than we're going to sign. That obviously is helped by conversions, but it's also new development. I mean if you look at the new development versus conversions, they're both up in sort of the low teens.
 So there's a lot of momentum. What's driving that? Of course, we think people have a lot of interest in our brands because of their best-performing brands. But if you look at the broader system because of the relative strength of this economy and many other economies around the world, people are largely very profitable. And as a result of being very profitable in their existing portfolio, their desire is to continue to expand their businesses. And so we feel very, very good about what's going on. The financing environment. I'll leave some other things for maybe other questions I can keep going. But that's sort of both from a revenue top line point of view and a little bit of color on both and unit growth to give you a sense of how we think about the outlook for the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. 
Joseph Greff: Chris, just kind of going back to your comments on how you're viewing the balance of this year. You mentioned all 3 major segments you would expect to be degrees of up year-over-year from a RevPAR growth perspective. If you were to bifurcate it between the full-service chain scale segments and the select service chain scale segments, would you expect the lower-end chain scale segments to be positive year-over-year? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, modestly. I mean we think they will be lower in performance, but we think our forecasting and outlook is they will be positive but modestly so. And those were impacted in the first quarter by the things -- more dramatically by the things that I described. And by the way, comparability because the first -- if you look broadly in the first quarter over the last year, from the standpoint of how we perform relative to the industry overall, we had a much better performance than the industry, and that was really driven by the select service brands. And so they have lapped in the first quarter over very, very difficult comps. That gets easier, pretty difficult comps in Q2 for the record as well, but we think that gets much easier in the second half of the year from a comp issue. And so our expectation is they would be positive but lower than other higher chain scales. 
Operator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. 
Robin Farley: Great. I wonder if you could kind of remind us where we are. You talked about the Group being up -- position up 13% year-over-year, but where we are with Group and business transient relative to 2019? And then I kind of have a part 2 of the question, which is just when we look at the broader FTR trends and occupancy in the U.S. has been down for -- depending on how you measure a month there from sort of 7 to 12 months with all the RevPAR coming from rate increase. And just wondering in your long experience looking at trends over the years, does that worry you at all that occupancy is down even with, I think, not getting back to 2019 levels yet and kind of what that might mean for rate and RevPAR later in the year? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Taking one at a time. In terms of Group and BT versus '19, they are both eclipsing from a revenue point of view, but from a demand occupancy point of view, they're both below business transient modestly, pretty minor. Group a little bit more so, I think, like 500 basis points or something like that is from memory. They can, in fact, check me. And that has -- so let me cover in reverse order business transient is, I mean Group is just a function of gestation period for this to ramp up. I think by the time you get to the second half of the year, and certainly, by the end of the year, Group demand will be finally back to where -- just based on the underlying strength in that space.
 Business transient, as I said, is a little bit off. If you break it down between small, medium businesses versus the big corporates, the small, medium businesses are already demand-wise over, and the big corporates are under. But as you saw, we had pretty big growth relative to a quarter that wasn't a lot of -- was more leisure-oriented because of the holiday shift in big corporates, and that's what we're hearing from our big corporate customers as they're traveling more. So that is coming back. Their balance sheets are strong. Earnings are still -- maybe they're going up at a lower rate or whatever, but they're still relatively strong.
 And so our expectation is by the end of the year from a demand point of view, we think there's an awfully good chance that BT will get there, too, just with continued growth in the big corporates in very resilient SMB business. And that's sort of how we've baked our outlook. In terms of occupancy and rate, that sort of answers the question then because we think you are continuing to build occupancy through the rest of the year. I think you got to be really careful in the first quarter. The first quarter is super messy with the things that we've talked about going on. It's really hard to like glean much from that.
 But if you look at the Group trends, they are really strong, as I said, and that provides a tremendous platform to yield manage that we really haven't had in the way that we're starting to have. And if you agree with the sort of the underpinnings of business transient and occupancies are not raging up but are sort of grinding up. Again, that gives you a pretty good setup for some modest occupancy gains. Those are going to come in BT and Group, not in Leisure. In fact, you could have slight occupancy declines in Leisure, but I think in the core of the more days of the week than not, you're building more pricing power, which I think allows you to continue to have the ability to push rate. 
Operator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. 
Shaun Kelley: Chris, just hoping we could get a little bit more color on sort of the regions. You gave some in the prepared remarks, but specifically, to dig in U.S. at the lower end of the range. So I think we've talked a little bit about what could get that coming. But anything you're seeing on April there in terms of some of the shift back from Easter. And then I think more importantly, you called out some strength elsewhere, Europe, Japan. Could you dig in a little bit there? And specifically on China, just flattish, the exit rate wasn't that great. What needs to happen there one way or another to impact Hilton? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Thanks. I'm going to ask Kevin to take that. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun, I'll take this one. I think, yes, in the U.S., we're seeing so far is in line with our expectations, right? The Easter calendar shift is flipping back the way we thought April is in line with what we thought. And so if you think about our 2% to 4% guide for the whole company, I think the U.S. will be at the lower end of that range, but I think you'll see the U.S. go back to positive I think around the rest of the world, I said it in my prepared remarks, but Europe remains really resilient, up 10% in the quarter. There's a lot of noise in the economy in various European economies and war and whatever else is going on, it still seems to push through, and we still seem to get pretty good performance. APAC, the same thing.
 Now China we said was flattish for the quarter. We think it will be about the same for the year. And what's happening there is what we said in our prepared remarks is that you had a lot of resilience coming out of the pandemic with domestic travel really fueling strong demand growth there. And now people are starting to move outside of the country because they can. And the urban markets in China are performing really well. The secondary tertiary markets are feeling the effects a little bit of people leaving the country and we think that will continue for the balance of the year. And I think you asked what you need to have that change is you need to have more inbound into China, particularly from other parts of Asia Pacific and then you need to see people from other parts of the world starting to come inbound to China to create that incremental demand that will enable us to yield rate and have that start to grow again. 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. The other thing -- I think that's all perfect, I would add on relative to China is we are also, while people aren't coming into China, we are starting to see that shift. There are a lot more flights that are going to start in the second and third quarter that are going to be going from major destinations, including the United States into China, which is going to help. But we are also seeing is the Chinese customer and as much as we think will sort of be flattish this year because there was a huge surge in Chinese were staying in China and traveling all over China, and now they're leaving. We are a net beneficiary of that and other parts of Asia.
 So if you look at our Southeast Asia business, our Japanese business, I mean, they are largely predominantly staying into Asia at the moment. I think that's going to change as more flights open up. And so we're getting -- well, China is not surging in the sense we talk about, we are seeing other markets, particularly Southeast Asia and Japan that are huge beneficiaries of that migration. 
Operator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. 
Carlo Santarelli: Kevin, I know you touched on it in your prepared remarks a little bit, but specifically on the base and other fees, I think they were up about 32% year-over-year, a dramatic acceleration. In terms of the things you mentioned, I would assume some of that is international, but any way you could provide a little bit more color on the drivers there? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean, part of it is, as you said, it's a mix. I mean, in parts of the world where we have more managed hotels is driving more management fees and incentive management fees. We had good performance in license fees, as we mentioned, were up ahead of the broader business. And then our purchasing business has been really strong as it continues to grow. And that you see showing up in other -- that business has continued to take share even outside of our system, it continues to take rate, and it's performing really well. So that's been a positive driver there as well. 
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. 
David Katz: With respect to net unit growth, I know you said previously that the acquired entities may add 25 or 50 basis points. Can you just sort of paint us a longer-term picture of how the addition of those should roll into your NUG. Is that sort of included Chris, when you say 6% plus. How should we think about those brands in the context of that? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean we did say last time that we were going to incorporate SLH into it, and that is incorporated into our 6% to 6.5%. We ultimately will add in Graduate, but just we think the better convention is to add both the EBITDA and earnings impact and the net NUG impact once closed so that is not in that. I think the way to think about it going forward is the SLH is going to be probably coming into our system over the next couple of years. It's early days, but so far, we really like what we're seeing. We're getting a very, very high percentage of existing SLH members in the markets that we have been out and with SLH marketing to sign up and want to come into the system. And we have no reason to believe that won't continue, getting the technology and all that done, which is people are working on both sides very, very diligently on. We'll start to get us to the other side and incorporating assets and the ability for our customers to book through our channels and honors, earn and burn and all of that, sometime probably middle or late summer so I mean, it's a little bit of a moving feast.
 But the 6% to 6.5% does incorporate what we said last time. It's probably 1/4 to 0.5 point is the way to think about that consistent with what we said last time. And there'll be more next year built into that. And my guess is as we grow that business with them, it will continue to contribute probably at a lesser degree just because we'll get the bulk of the system in over this year and next. Graduate will be kind of a onetime thing. And as we said at our Investor Day, we believe -- and we don't have -- I said there, we had one other thing we were working on. We announced one thing since then. We don't -- I don't think you should expect that you're going to see any additions to NUG in that arena.
 Now I'm going to say because I always do, never say never. I've been saying that for the many years I've been running the company, but we don't have any other of those sorts of tricks up our sleeve anytime soon. So I think the way to think about our guidance of 6% to 7% over the next few years is there'll be a onetime sort of thing for Graduate, but it's otherwise organic in the way it's always been. 
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. 
Bennett Rose: I just noticed that the percent of the pipeline under construction just ticked up a little bit from fourth quarter and first quarter. I was just wondering, is that concentrated in the U.S. and could you just maybe talk a little bit about what developers are seeing in terms of getting properties out of the ground on the financing front or getting the supplies of the workers they need. Just any color along there? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I mean I think the percentage under construction is from both. I don't have the breakdown right in front of me, but it's definitely from both and then somewhat driven by slightly higher. We've been talking about a slightly higher percentage of conversions. So those go under construction more quickly. And so as you do those, it moves the percentage of the pipeline that's under construction a little bit. I think in terms of the atmospherics, I think, look, you hear -- we all hear from a lot of developers, you probably talk to developers. It's still challenging the labor cost side of it and the raw materials cost side of it, those dramatic increases that we saw during COVID have leveled off. So that's a good news story.
 Capital remains more expensive, although I think important to note that it's a little bit less expensive than it would have been sort of end of last year or over the course of last year. So I think you're still seeing better developers and the better projects are getting financed. It's a good new story broadly across the industry, fewer things are coming out of the ground, but we're taking share. So we have higher quality brands that are more easily financeable. So more of our projects are getting done and coming out of the ground. It's just sort of at a slightly slower rate. But like as we said in our prepared remarks, and Chris mentioned in some of the Q&A, we think our starts are going to eclipse prior peaks this year, they're going to be obviously up year-over-year. And so we're getting enough done to keep momentum, but it's still a little bit tough out there in terms of financing. 
Operator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. 
Brandt Montour: And maybe for Kevin. Kevin, you mentioned timing items. If you could just elaborate on that and sort of what and where and when we should expect any of that to reverse, please? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I mean timing will be -- it will largely reverse in the second quarter. It's not huge. It's sort of $5 million to $10 million of timing items in the first quarter. And then to sort of just finish the story at the risk of doing modeling live on the call. But we did increase our guidance at the midpoint by $45 million, but that has a headwind -- an incremental headwind in and of about $10 million to $15 million, closer to $15 million of FX over the course of the year. So we did, in fact, carry through a little bit more than the beat in terms of our outlook for the year. 
Operator: The next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. 
Chad Beynon: Wanted to ask about Group beyond '24. Is this continuing to build in terms of multiyear commitments? Maybe just kind of a stat in terms of what you're seeing on the books for '25 at this point versus what you historically have seen during these periods? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I don't have the data point in my head, but I do know this. Yes, it's building for '25, '26. I believe both years are sort of high single, low double-digit increases relative to where we've been in the past. So yes, I mean, they're putting the data in front of me. So my memory is right, 13% and 15% up in '25 and '26. 
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist. 
Charles Scholes: On the NoMad news, that's a pretty small change at the moment. What are your plans for that? Where do you see that brand going in the next 5 years? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Look, we think it will -- it is a very strong brand. There's a reason why we wanted to partner with them/controlling interest in that company. It is small today, but it's been a little bit bigger over time, such a well-known brand in the community. And we think that brand will compete really effectively combined with our engines and the strength of our system, compete really effectively with the other luxury lifestyle brands that are out there, and we think it can be upwards of 100 hotels over time. And so most of those will be -- there'll be some conversions, but a lot of them will be new build. So it will be a little bit longer burn, and it's a little bit smaller segment than some of our other scale brands, but we think it will fit in nicely and contribute positively to our NUG over time. 
Christopher Nassetta: And what we really love about it is we did as I've talked about, it seems like time and eternity, luxury lifestyle. We did a huge amount of work because one of the options was to do this on our own, which you know we are pretty good at and like to do historically. And as we did the work over the last bunch of years, sort of like because this is always benefit in the skunk works, and I'm not exaggerating, this is sort of the ethos of what Andrew Zobler and his team have created a sort of bull's-eye for what we think is modern luxury lifestyle today and going forward in terms of what customers are looking for.
 And so it was a very efficient way for us to get in the space, accelerate our entry in the space, meaning take -- let's be honest, multiple years because they already have a pipeline, let alone what we're adding to it. And importantly, with Andrew and his team be able to effectively acquire a really talented team of people that are very steeped in the luxury lifestyle space. So we think it was sort of the trifecta. It hit every button for us in terms of making sense. But yes, it's very small. But hey, the good news is it's very small, we didn't pay a whole lot for it, and that means great organic growth going forward. 
Operator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. 
Duane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate it. Just coming back to the fee rate growth, if we just look at fees as a percentage of total room rev. Can you speak to what drives seasonality, if anything, on this percentage. And in terms of the year-over-year improvement, you showed nice improvement here in the first quarter. Can we hold on to that as we progress through the year? Or is it lumpy? 
Kevin Jacobs: Sorry, Duane, I didn't quite catch the first part of your question. 
Duane Pfennigwerth: Just the fee rate growth, which you showed nice improvement on year-over-year total fees as a percentage of room rev, is there seasonality on that percentage? And if so, what drives it? In other words, you made nice progress here in the first quarter. It's one of the concepts you talked about in your Investor Day is sort of raising royalty fees, et cetera. Is there anything specific to the first quarter that's kind of nonrecurring? Or can we hold on to that improvement as we progress through the year? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think it's a bit of both without getting into too much detail. There was a touch of the timing was in fees, but a lot of it is strength. And like I said earlier in one of my answers, in the parts of the world where our managed business is bigger and the segments in the U.S. with urban hotels where our managed business is bigger, we think incentive management fees will continue to be a strong contributor over the course of the year, and that's sort of all baked into our guidance. So no anomalies in there. 
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. 
Michael Bellisario: Two parts for you on loyalty. Just first, what was Honors occupancy in the quarter? And then bigger picture. Just aside from offering customers more options, how are you driving how are you thinking about incremental engagement? I know you're still having to educate travelers about loyalty and the benefit of loyalty, especially compared to all the book direct and marketing campaigns you had to do pre-pandemic? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Honors occupancy was, I think, at our historical high 64% and change up like 300 to something -- a little over 300 basis points year-over-year. And so Honors is working. Our customers are engaged more than I think any other program that is out in the industry. We do have a bunch of things that we are doing. Some of them you've seen that are -- what we're doing with SLH, what we're doing with AutoCamp, you should expect to see more not like Graduate type things, but more partnerships particularly in the experiential area. I think I talked about it on the last call so more AutoCamps, I think areas like safaris and yachts and other riverboat cruises and other things because we know that our customers -- those are adjunct sort of travel experiences that connect to our business that gives our base of customers, incremental things to engage with us that they want to do and is not in conflict in any way with our business, but we think is synergistic.
 And so there are a bunch of other things that we're doing that. But in reality, our expectation, while we, I think, to lead the industry, I know we do at 64%. We have aspirations as we talked about at Investor Day, to be really at 75%, maybe over time, even higher. And that's a very -- I'm not going to get into the details of it for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But that is that is not 1 or 2 things. That's a series of strategies broadly for Honors, some of which I just talked about, further opportunities to keep customers engaged in other ways that are new and different and appealing to them.
 But it's also a significant amount of work that creates a more bespoke offering in certain major regions of the world, I think Asia Pacific, particularly China and other parts of the world where loyalty is a big deal, but what appeals to that customer base may be a little bit different than what might appeal to a customer base here in the United States. And so there's -- again, there are a whole bunch of different things that we are going to do. So I think you should have an expectation you'll continue to see that Honors occupancy go up as a result of greater engagement. Obviously, that is our lowest cost distribution channel. And so that's good for us and very good for our owners that it helps drive incremental market share gains and does it on a very cost-efficient basis. But I'm not going to get into granular strategies within Honors in this format or any format for that matter other than with our customers. 
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James. 
William Crow: Two parter here, Chris. First, how much risk do you think exists? Or are you seeing any signs that the weaker demand we're seeing at the low end of the chain scale could migrate upward as the Feds hire for longer stance persists? And the second part is simply third quarter, how much impact do you anticipate from the Olympics, if any, on overall results? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean we do think the Olympics will be a nice positive for Europe broadly and obviously, for Paris and France. I mean our -- it's not going to dramatically impact our numbers just because Europe is a pretty big part of our portfolio. But if you look at France, while we're present in a lot of markets in France. We're not -- it's not a large portion of our portfolio. So it will be great, and it will help, but it's not going to help as much as if it was in New York City or summer where we had a huge density hotels.
 In terms of the first question, which I think is a really good question. And I think, listen, it deserves a good answer, and I'll give you the best I got. The best I got is who said it George H. W. Bush, it's the economy, stupid, I think. I'm not calling you stupid Bill, for the record. But it has everything to do with the economy. I mean the reality is, as I said in my comments, our outlook is based on a pretty -- not just consensus view, but a strong consensus view that the economy is going to be growing at a decent rate and employment is going to stay pretty strong. 
 Obviously, higher for longer is the Fed's way of trying to like tamp things down. But there's no question in my mind, you can have your own view. Everybody can that the Fed is trying to orchestrate a soft landing. So far, it feels like they have been able to do it.
 Our outlook with the U.S. being at the low end of our guidance ranges sort of anticipate that consensus view, which is a soft landing, which means the economy is more resilient than people thought but broadly as the year goes on, softening because that's what the Fed is trying to do. And we have tried to sort of factor for all of that in our guidance. And so whether it's the upper end, lower end or wherever it is, I think it has everything to do with a broader economy. The good news for us is the median income of our core customer, like our lower member is high, it's $150,000 median income where the Fed where you look at the data out of the credit card companies and the retailers, it's like $100,000 and below is where you see people stretched and credit card balances, bank accounts running out and credit card balances going up. When you get up into the $150,000, the data still looks really good in terms of people have a lot of money in the bank and they have enough disposable income. 
 And as I said, businesses, company, corporate America is still relatively strong. So I think of the economy, if they -- I think this range and outcome that we've given and sort of where the U.S. we think will flush out is based on the consensus view that we will have some slowing but a soft landing and positive economic growth. 
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. 
Richard Clarke: In the quarter versus 2019, it looks like U.S. occupancy is still 450 basis points where you were pre-COVID. Obviously, there's some seasonality in there but that doesn't seem to get you anywhere near that. Is it just now a matter of time to get that occupancy back or can we now think that maybe there has been some structural shift in travel that means kind of... 
Christopher Nassetta: I think you answered it, large. That has more to do with seasonality than anything. And the calendar shift because remember, Leisure is sort of 25% or 30% of our business and because of the calendar -- because of the holiday shift, it ended up being a big leisure quarter, which meant Leisure was good, but the reality is then 70%, 75% of the business was not. And so I think it's a seasonal plus the compounding impact of the movement of the holiday. So I do think -- I mean, listen, we sort of got -- we got pretty close in December. So I mean, by the fourth quarter of last year, we were pretty tight on 2019 levels. 
Operator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. 
Conor Cunningham: Could you just talk a little bit about the competition for conversions? Where things are most intense and where regions or areas that you're having more success? You obviously did really well in the first quarter, I think you said 30% of your makeup of the new development was there. Just any thoughts there on competition? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Conor. It sort of depends on -- it's sort of a little bit deal dependent, right? Sometimes it often depends on which flags are available in that particular market. It depends on where you are at the upper end in luxury, there's a lot more competition because there's just more brands. And then when you get into the sort of the middle tiers and below, there's us and a couple of others that -- not to be competitive that sort of maybe fight for second place when we're not available. So yes, we do really well. I think for the full year last year, in the U.S., we did 40% of all conversion deals that were done in the U.S. 
 So we take a lot of share. We're doing really well. We've talked about Spark is going to be really disruptive in terms of your bringing a brand to a segment that we haven't been in before. So you're combining the strength of our engines with a brand that's sort of new and innovative and can be really disruptive in that space. But that's not the only place we're being successful. We're being successful all over the world. I think we mentioned DoubleTree in our prepared remarks. Our soft brands are gaining momentum, Curio, Tapestry, LXR, so it really -- I'm rambling a little bit. It really does depend on the deal in terms of who shows up and we're competitive with. But I think the good news is when our flags are available, if you can mine our engines with the quality of our brands, we're always right there at the top of the list for developers. 
Operator: The next question is from Dan Politzer with Wells Fargo. 
Daniel Politzer: Europe seems like it's certainly a bright spot within your portfolio. Can you maybe even outside the Olympics for the rest of the year, could you maybe frame where you're seeing that demand? Is it on the business or leisure side? Is it kind of the higher chain scales or middle tier? Any additional detail there would be helpful. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think it's really across the board. They're seeing the same dynamics. The Group demand is strong, business, Leisure, particularly with the strength of the dollar that sort of buys more for leisure travelers going over there, it's really been across the board. 
Operator: The next question is from Ben Chaiken with Mizuho. 
Benjamin Chaiken: Great flow-through on revenue to EBITDA in 1Q. That's in the context of what sounds like some calendar headwinds. Anything you would call out as a tailwind or a comp dynamic or just good blocking and tackling. If I heard correctly, I believe you mentioned there was a $10 million good guy in 1Q that I believe reverses in 2Q? Just anything you could call out as we progress through the year? 
Christopher Nassetta: A little bit, but I think it's good blocking and tackling. And we -- our flow-through of revenue to EBITDA, we think, is consistent with what we've been saying and outlining 50 -- low 50s and what we described at Investor Day. So Q1 is, I think, a good demonstration of great discipline in running the business even when top line was a little bit lighter than what we had hoped for. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. And again, I think I said this before, but when it comes from fees, right, I mean, that's obviously our highest margin business. And so an incremental dollar of fees and IMF drops straight to the bottom line. So when the strength comes from the fee segment, which probably will continue to because that's our largest segment and our fastest-growing segment, you're going to continue to see better flow-through and margin growth. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional closing remarks. 
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks, everybody. As always, we appreciate you dedicating this much time as we've described. We feel good about the business, good about momentum, good about where broadly economies are to deliver the results that we've talked about and super good about the momentum we have on the development side. And we will look forward to talking to you this summer after we complete Q2. Thanks again and talk soon. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q4  (2024-02-07 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode [Operator Instructions]. After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you, M. J. Welcome to Hilton's fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.  This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President of Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.  With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are happy to report a great end to what was another really strong year for Hilton. For the year, system-wide RevPAR grew 12.6% versus 2022 with solid growth across every major region and chain scale compared to 2019, RevPAR increased 10.7%. Strong top line performance drove record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $3.1 billion, up roughly 20% year-over-year to the highest level in our company's history. During the year, we launched two new brands, introduced new innovations, expanded our partnerships and opened a near record number of rooms, all of which further strengthened our network and enabled us to welcome more guests than ever before. Our strong top and bottom line performance drove significant free cash flow, enabling us to return $2.5 billion to shareholders. Turning to results for the quarter. System wide RevPAR increased 5.7% year-over-year, exceeding our expectations, driven by strong international and group trends. Group RevPAR rose 6% year-over-year due to an uptick in small company meetings and convention demand. Business transient recovery continued in the quarter with RevPAR up more than 4% [visited] by gains in both rate and occupancy. As expected, leisure transient RevPAR increased 3%, decelerating modestly versus the third quarter, largely due to seasonality. Compared to 2019, system wide RevPAR grew 13.5% in the quarter, up more than 200 basis points sequentially compared to the third quarter. Demand continued to improve with December system wide occupancy reaching 2019 peak levels. Group RevPAR outperformed expectations, increasing 8% versus 2019 and up more than 700 basis points sequentially versus the third quarter. Business transient continued to recover growing 5% versus 2019. As expected, leisure RevPAR remained strong growing 25% versus 2019 and decelerating sequentially due to calendar shifts. As we look to the year ahead, we expect system wide top line growth of 2% to 4% versus 2023. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth across all major regions with international markets modestly outpacing the US. We also expect positive RevPAR growth across all segments, driven by continued recovery in business transient and group coupled with steady leisure demand. We expect continued recovery in small company meetings and large association and convention business to drive strong group performance. For 2024, group positions is up 16% year-over-year with small companies meetings increasing as a percentage of mix, further demonstrating the value of small and medium sized businesses given higher rates and greater resiliency. Turning to development. We continue to see positive momentum throughout the year opening 24,000 rooms in the fourth quarter, marking the largest quarter of openings in our history. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the openings of our 250th Tru Hotel and our 1000th Hilton Garden Inn. We also reached 70,000 rooms globally for Home2. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Signia by Hilton Atlanta, the city's largest ground up development in over 40 years. The property strategically located next to the Georgia World Congress Center and Mercedes-Benz Stadium features nearly a thousand rooms and over a hundred thousand square feet of meeting space, including the largest hotel ballroom in Georgia. For the full year, we opened 395 hotels, totaling approximately 63,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 4.9%. Conversion activity remains strong, accounting for 30% of openings and demonstrating the strong value proposition our system continues to deliver for owners. Full service and collection brands represented the large majority of conversions and continue to gain traction with owners. Both Curio and Tapestry open more hotels in 2023 than in any other year. Even with robust openings, our pipeline reached the highest level in our history, driven by record signings of 130,000 rooms, up 45% year-over-year and up 12% compared to pre-pandemic levels. At year end, our pipeline totaled over 462,000 rooms with roughly half under construction following a strong year in construction starts. For the full year, starts increased 15%, driven by the US. We continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company with approximately one in every five hotel rooms under construction globally slated to join our system. As we look to the year ahead, we expect continued positive momentum in signing starts and conversions to drive even stronger openings, boosted by our two newest brands, Spark and LivSmart Studios. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth to accelerate to the higher end of our 5.5% to 6% guidance range with the opportunity for further upside of 25 to 50 basis points from our exclusive partnership with Small Luxury Hotels of the World that we announced this morning. This partnership will meaningfully expand our luxury distribution as we expect to add the majority of their over 500 hotels to our system. Adding this extraordinary portfolio with a heavy orientation to resort locations to our already strong and growing luxury portfolio will further enhance a powerful network effect and give our guests even more opportunities to dream, book, earn and burn points, and we're doing so in a capital light way. The royalty rate will be in line with our existing brands, but fees will be paid only on the business driven through our channels. We expect over time to drive a meaningful portion of system revenues for SLH, and we'll start to integrate hotels into our system later this spring. Last quarter, we announced Hilton for Business, our multifaceted program designed to transform the travel experience for small and medium sized businesses by providing a new booking Web site along with targeted benefits designed specifically for SMBs. The program launched in January with thousands of companies registering in just the first few weeks. SMBs account for approximately 85% of our business transient mix and comprising meaningful and growing percentage of our group mix. Given its greater resiliency and higher rates, we think this important customer base provides significant opportunities to drive further growth. Overall, we remain focused on creating unique experiences in our hotels, including through innovative food and beverage offerings. We recently announced the launch of StiR Creative Collective, an in-house consulting and development arm that gives us the ability to work with our owners, operators and hotel teams to elevate food and beverage offerings to meet the evolving needs of our guests. Several noteworthy StiR projects have already launched at the Conrad Orlando, the Canopy by Hilton in Toronto and the new Signia in Atlanta. In a business of people serving people, our team members are at the heart of absolutely everything we do. We recently celebrated the remarkable achievement of being named the number one world's best workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. This recognition follows eight consecutive appearances on the world's best list and marks the first time a hospitality company has achieved the top honor in this best in class program. Additionally, for the seventh consecutive year, we were honored to be included on both the world and North America Dow Jones sustainability indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our performance with our world class brands and powerful commercial engines driving a record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth. We're confident in our ability to continue delivering value for all of our stakeholders in 2024 and beyond.  Now, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give a bit more detail on the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 5.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance and continued recovery in group and business transient. Adjusted EBITDA was $803 million in the fourth quarter, up 9% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, largely due to better than expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $1.68. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 2% year-over-year with performance led by both business, transient and group. Leisure transient in the US was flat with difficult year-over-year comparisons. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 11% in the fourth quarter, improving 100 basis points versus the third quarter. In the Americas outside the US, fourth quarter RevPAR increased 7% year-over-year with urban markets delivering RevPAR growth of 17% boosted by strong group business. In Europe, RevPAR grew 10% year-over-year with solid performance across all segments. Large events, including the Rugby World Cup in Paris, drove strong group performance across several key cities. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 12% year-over-year, led by strong rate growth. The COP 28 Climate Change Conference in Dubai, along with solid trends in Egypt, contributed to strong performance in the region. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 42% year-over-year, led by continued demand recovery across China and Japan and notable strength across all segments. RevPAR in China was up 73% year-over-year in the quarter with RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region, excluding China, up 18% year-over-year. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 4.9% and ended the year with over 462,000 rooms in our pipeline, which was up 11% year-over-year with approximately 60% located outside the US and nearly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, we are excited about our strong development story and the robust demand for Hilton branded products in both the US and international markets. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system wide RevPAR growth of 2% to 4% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $690 million $710 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.36 and $1.44. For full year ‘24, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.33 billion and $3.38 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.80 and $6.94. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $158 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2023, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return approximately $3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks.  We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourselves to one question. M. J., can we have our first question please?
Operator: The first question today comes from Joe Greff with JP Morgan.
Joe Greff: Chris, I was hoping you can talk about M&A of brands. Obviously, there was an article earlier this week, suggesting you might be close with the Graduate Hotels brand. If you want to comment specifically on this, but I would just love to get your overall view on opportunities for you to acquire brands. And then since it's something that you've been sort of not doing at all, maybe you can revisit some of the criteria for brand M&A.
Chris Nassetta: I'm happy to do that, Joe. I figured with all the rumor and all, I'd get asked this question. Obviously, first and foremost, you're right, I'm not going to comment on market rumors and speculation on anything specific. I would say my attitude, our attitude on M&A is really the same as it's always been. If nothing, we've been consistent and I've been consistent in what I've said. And that is we -- the fact is, as you point out, we haven't done any, but every time I've ever been asked for the last 10 years of being public, I've said never say never, but we have a very tough filtration system. And that filtration system at a high level is, number one, does something really -- is something additive from the standpoint of the portfolio of brands that we have. And from the standpoint of offering our customers, a product and experience that would be really additive to the family of brands that we have, number one. And number two, and importantly, can it be done in a way that's accretive to the value of the company. For the last 16 years, going on 17 years that I've been here, we've looked at pretty much everything. I've said that to everybody and nothing is passed through that filter. So that's the reason we haven't done anything. The environment we're in is a little bit different. There is, for a lot of reasons, interest rates and otherwise, more stress in the system than normal, that probably, I think, presents more opportunity to do things like this, but things that are quite modest in my view and that are what I view as sort of tuck-in acquisitions. Now I still think the filtration system is really rigorous. And obviously, we're not sitting here announcing any acquisitions. We announced a strategic exclusive partnership with SLH that we're very excited about, and I'm sure we'll talk about from other questions on the call. So that we don't have anything to report. And to the extent that we do, obviously, you guys will be the first to know. And so summary is we have no different attitude. We continue to look at everything but the stress in the environment maybe provides a little bit more opportunity than we've seen in quite a long time.
Operator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: Chris, you obviously -- you talked about the strength in business transient and group that you kind of foresee for 2024. Given those mixes respectively are down couple of hundred basis points from pre-pandemic levels, I was kind of wondering where you think they settle for 2024? And what impact that mix shift has obviously presumably taking away from leisure demand to some degree on ADRs for the year?
Chris Nassetta: I think broadly, if you look at the segments, and I said it at a very high level in the prepared comments, we feel really good about all the segments. Business transient continues to recover. I mean the big corporates finished the year still a bit off, probably 5% off of where they were, but still but growing, every segment in that world is a little bit different. I mean most segments were relatively strong and either back to or beyond prior to pandemic levels with the exception of probably banking, technology and consulting, which were less. But blended together, they weren't that far off. SMB segment is at or above, most of those segments are at or above. And when you blend all that together for the fourth quarter full year from a RevPAR point of view, business transient was ahead, but from an occupancy point of view was still a bit behind. We do think that by the time we finish this year, assuming sort of the broader consensus view of a reasonably soft landing that by the time we get to the end of the year, we think will be at more normalized levels of demand. And we believe given very low supply numbers that are continuing and continued decent economic growth that we're going to continue to have pricing power there and everywhere else. On the group side, I'll give you a snippet of like group position being up 16%, that's the best leading indicator. But anecdotally, sitting around this very table last week with all our teams from around the world and all of our commercial and sales leads, I've said it, the demand is off the hook. I mean the demand is really strong. Every quarter is the next new high watermark in terms of bookings for all future periods. So we are seeing very good strength. We believe the group demand is quite sticky in the sense that a lot of it still is pent-up demand that are things people haven't done for a long time that they need to do in addition to incremental new demand. You're obviously seeing in the group space, the big association, citywide business start to come back, that's super sticky business because of the time frames associated with the planning and the cost. So we think group will definitely lead the system. And as a result, you asked about rate, which I'll cover on both, we think rate will be very strong. Just there is so much demand and there's just a limited amount of space, if you think about it, not only is supply low broadly, but supply of hotels over the last 10 years that have been built that have a lot of meeting space has been [nimic]. And so you have a lot of demand -- I mean, I was sitting around this table yesterday, we're planning our own conferences for like sales conferences and general managers and all these things that we have to start going out three and four years, because we can't get space in our own hotels. So demand is good as a result with very limited supply, pricing should be good. And then on leisure, we do think it will grow. We do think probably more in rate than volume, because the consumer, particularly our consumer, which is our median income levels, reasonably good. It's in the 140,000 to 150,000 range. They still have plenty of money, plenty of desire to travel. And again, there's just not a lot of new supply. So the fundamental economic setup is good. Obviously, it got supercharged coming out of COVID, so it will probably -- we think it will grow more rate than volume, but it will grow. But it will be third in line after continued recovery starting with group then business transient, then leisure transient. So we feel really good about -- again, based on a broad consensus view that we have a rational sort of reasonably soft landing and continue to see decent -- slowing broadly, but decent economic growth in 2024.
Carlo Santarelli: And then if I could, just a follow-up on Joe's question from earlier. The guidance for 2024, I'm going to assume that SLH and any kind of tuck-in M&A that you guys do in 2024 would be on top of the guidance that you provided this morning…
Chris Nassetta: Correct. The 5.5% to 6% with a strong indication to the high end of that is pure organic. I said in my prepared comments, we think SLH depends on how rapidly hotels come in, which is why there's a range, 25 to 50 basis points on top of that. And if we were to do anything else, it's all on top of that. But that is the 5.5% to 6% were leading towards the high end of it is pure organic.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley: Chris, wondering maybe you could build off of the last part there about SLH. And it’s pretty selective. But just A, can you give us a little bit more about the deal itself? And I think it sounds economically quite similar to what we see kind of in the normal course on the fee side, but any color you can provide there? And then I think more importantly is just big picture, do you think there are other collection and places out there that you could utilize your distribution capability and help other systems that may exist out there but not overlap directly with owners, which I know is going to be a sensitivity point for you.
Chris Nassetta: Well, first of all, on SLH, as you hopefully could tell from my prepared comments, we're really excited about it. We've had a relationship there for a while. We've been working with them to figure this out and we're really excited to be able to get it done. I mean if you think about it, it's sort of like the moons and the stars aligned super well for us. We're going to be able to bring the majority of 500 hotels that are super unique, small, obviously, Small Luxury -- it's Small Luxury but very heavy resort orientation and very heavily oriented to very niche markets that are super hard to get into. And so when you look at it vis-a-vis the overlap of our existing -- we have 100 open luxury hotels, we have about another 60, 70 in the pipeline. So a terrific portfolio and growing super rapidly. When you look at the overlap, there is really none just because this is a really unique collection of hotels. We did a bunch of focus groups and customer research around this over the last year and really feel like this offering from the standpoint of our customers, particularly our higher end customers is going to be super well received in terms of their ability to bucket through our channels, but earn points, burn their points, go on their vacations in these places and the like. And so we think it is literally the perfect combination. And an unbelievable way for us to take what is currently 100 -- with pipeline 150, 160 hotel luxury portfolio and turn it into 600 or 700 scattered in all the best and most unique and hard to duplicate places around the world. So we think this is great. Customers, we think, based on all the work we did, are going to really love it, and we're excited to start ramping up including them in all our channels. In terms of the economics, we feel really good about it. As I said, we want to be really straightforward. I mean the license fees that we're getting are very similar sort of in the zone of what we would typically get in all of our -- with our direct brands. One difference in this case, as I said in my comments, we'll get paid on the business we generate, which we think will be significant. I mean it will take time to ramp that up, it will be significant. And that there's real economics in this for us as well. So we think sort of like, as I said, moons and stars, fabulous for the network effect, fabulous for our customers, and we think really good for shareholders in the sense that we'll be generating meaningful fees, and we are investing nothing, it's fully capital light.
Shaun Kelley: And just as a follow-up there, Chris. Just any thoughts on, again, sort of future opportunities that could look like sort of leverage the platform…
Chris Nassetta: I think there are always -- I mean we're looking at lots of different things all the time. I mean since the IPO road show, we have talked a lot about network effect. I mean, very consistently trying to build that out to create an ecosystem that brings customers in and builds loyalty. And so we're always looking at other opportunities. And so I think there are possibilities in that regard. But nothing -- I would say, right now, we're focused on this. This is a lot of effort and work to get these built into the system. And we'll see, we'll see, anything that we think we can do to keep building -- bringing new customers in and giving them and our existing customers more products that resonate with them, that builds more loyalty and that we can commercialize in the sense of being paid for the effort we're interested in. But nothing more to report at this point beyond SLH.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies.
David Katz: Just to follow on the same theme. Is there a case or a strategy or thought around whether SLH could either naturally or strategically transition into a business use as well? I admit I've not stayed one. Is there any particular barrier to that as business people tend to choose smaller and smaller hotels, more unique properties over time?
Chris Nassetta: Listen, absolutely no barrier. I mean I emphasize the resort, because if you look at it as a percentage of their rooms and a number of hotels, a lot of them are in resort locations. By the way, there's over 500 hotels and growing. By the way, it's not like it's static, it's growing and we think we're going to help them grow at a much faster pace by being in our system. So we think this will continue to be 500, 600, 700 and continue to grow. There are plenty that are in urban locations around the world that are small luxury boutique hotels, just percentage wise, it's more resorts. But there's a very good representation in urban environments around the world and some really interesting urban environments that we don't have luxury exposure to. And so we absolutely believe that this is also crosses over into business transient. It will also drive some group business, but prototypically these hotels have very limited meeting space just by the very nature of what they are. I mean they have some boardrooms and small meeting spaces. So it will drive some meetings and events business, but I think it will be a lot of leisure and then -- first and foremost, and then business transient. But I think business transient will be a meaningful component of it, particularly in those hotels in the right locations.
David Katz: If I can just ask about the locations geographically, what kinds of cities are in it now and where would they like to be, please?
Chris Nassetta: I think if you looked at the map, I mean, you can go on rather than me describing it, you can go on their Web site. I mean right now, it's sort of like 60% of it is in Europe, 20% in the US, 20% in APAC. The major cities in those markets, they have -- pretty much all of them have some representation. What you'll find if you went and then double clicked on that is that locations within those cities are pretty unique just because of what they are and where they are. So they're in niche super hard to duplicate locations within most of those major cities.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.
Smedes Rose: I just had a quick question again, on the SLH. To reach the higher -- above the 6% unit growth that you said you're comfortable with, what sort of penetration would you need to reach within the SLH portfolio, I guess, in year one to get to the 6.25% or 6.5% growth that you mentioned with this potential -- with this partnership?
Chris Nassetta: We ultimately think the majority of SLH hotels are going to join our system and feel confident in that. The question is just going to be with all the technology and -- I mean all of which is being worked on because we've been -- we signed it recently, we've been working with them for quite some time. So the range of 25 to 50, which we feel comfortable, just has to do with how quickly we can get all -- execute against all of the technology requirements and the like. So again, as I said, we feel good about the high end of 5.5% to 6% without any of those. The quarter [indiscernible] will depend on just the speed of execution. And so next call, we'll try and give you -- we just signed the deal, teams are working hot and heavy on it. On the next call, we can probably try and refine it a bit, we'll have a better set.
Smedes Rose: And just, Kevin, could you just share with us what the year-end share count was?
Kevin Jacobs: I actually don't have the actual share count in front of me right now, Smedes. We'll follow up with you.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays.
Brandt Montour: Just one more on SLH.
Chris Nassetta: We're excited about it, too. So happy to [Multiple Speakers]…
Brandt Montour: I mean, I guess the question is, when you think about those hotels coming in the system, and it sounds like they're all -- you think that they might all come at some point. But do they have to opt in? And sort of what is -- those individual hotel owners, what does the mechanism look like? I guess I would have thought of them all…
Chris Nassetta: They have to opt in and we and the team at SLH have already started the process of communicating with them in that process, but they have the option to opt in. Now we think as does SLH, at least the owners that we've discussed with that it's a compelling value proposition for them to be opting in, which is why we have confidence that the majority of the system ultimately will come in. But they have the option to opt in or not.
Brandt Montour: And so just to quickly follow-up on that. So these are hotels that went to SLH originally, because they wanted to keep their sort of whole specific brand, their own name and be very independent and you're basically allowing them to do that same thing by going [Multiple Speakers]…
Chris Nassetta: We're allowing them to keep all of that, they're not branding with us. The SLH brand is maintained. So it's the same branding they've had. We're just giving them access to hundreds of millions of customers, a loyalty program all of our sort of commercial booking channels and the like, which obviously has proven to be, given the market share we drive in our system, quite a compelling value proposition. So we feel good about it for the same reasons we feel good about all of our development progress.
Operator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.
Robin Farley: So looking at your pipeline, your rooms under construction looks like it's back almost to pre-pandemic levels pretty much. So I guess I'm just wondering what percent of your 2024 unit growth are you expecting to come from conversions?
Kevin Jacobs: We think we did 30%, as Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks this year. We think it will be a little bit higher than that, sort of in the mid-30s for the year this year.
Robin Farley: And I know you're not guiding to anything next year yet. But is that something you expect to accelerate as a percent of your unit growth over time or do you think that we're seeing that sort of mid-30% range this year will be kind of the most, and then it will return to more normal additional supply under construction?
Kevin Jacobs: I mean over time, it will depend on market cycles, of course, but I think as we -- particularly with Spark, which is 100% conversion brand, I think it will drift upwards over time and become an important part of -- it's always been an important part, but it will be a little bit higher over time. And then again, it will vary with market cycles over a longer period of time.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie.
Chad Beynon: With respect to the 2% to 4% RevPAR guide, Chris, I know you walked through this from a segment standpoint, and it's obviously early in the year. In 2023, you guys exceeded [Star] results in each quarter. And for '24, I think [Star] has a slightly more positive outlook than you guys. So could you kind of maybe kind of square that circle in terms of your process versus maybe how [Star] would do it? And then, I guess, more importantly, should we expect the international RevPAR, I know it's FX neutral, to be more positive for you guys than domestically?
Chris Nassetta: I mean, as you would guess, we look at what all the pundits have to say, including Smith Travel, and that's interesting, but we do a ground-up process. I mean this is done by every individual hotel in the world, all 7,500 plus of them that then aggregates into us having a budget, and then we create a range around it. So that's the process we go through. Obviously, there's lots of uncertainty still on -- as we've talked about, we sort of tend always to take the consensus view, which right now is a soft landing. So there are a lot of different paths that the broader economy can take. But it feels, certainly, with what we're seeing in our business that, that is the most likely outcome. And so this is how we aggregated it together on a property-by-property basis. I would like to believe, and certainly, every year, I believe that I've been here in 16 years, we have grown market share, including last year, where we grew market share pretty nicely, and we are currently at the highest levels of market share we've ever had in our history. If we do our job again this year, we will grow market share again, which should mean that we would outperform whatever the market gives us. That is what we are trying to do. In terms of internationally, I think I said it in my comments, international is going to be a bit above the US, in part because you still have parts of Asia. One, EMEA is really strong, just basically strong, it's recovered and strong. And then you have parts of Asia Pacific that are still sort of recovering, notably the China market and the comparability benefits and that's really causing a slight overperformance in international versus US.
Chad Beynon: Looking forward to more of that at the Investor Day.
Chris Nassetta: Look forward to seeing everybody.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities.
Patrick Scholes: This question is for Kevin. Just give us an update on how Spark is progressing. And then related to that, given the uncertainty surrounding what's happening with Choice and Wyndham, do you think that is helping with your conversion activity?
Kevin Jacobs: Look, Spark is going great. I mean, we've got nearly 150 of them in the pipeline already, and we just launched it last year. We've got another 250 working deals, something like that, so 400 working deals. We had eight or 10 of them open now that are performing really well. So we're picking up a lot of momentum. So we feel really good about the future of Spark and its value proposition. And I think I'm probably not going to comment on what our competitors might or might not be doing together. We believe strongly in the value proposition for Spark that's why we launched it, and we don't think that anything that goes on in the environment around us will change that trajectory or our ability to be successful in that segment.
Operator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.
Duane Pfennigwerth: I wonder if you could offer some thoughts on the trajectory you see from here on mid scale and below chain scales, still up meaningfully versus pre-pandemic, but a bit softer year-over-year. How do you interpret that? And is there anything you see on the horizon that could drive some acceleration this year on the lower end?
Kevin Jacobs: Look, I think some of it is comps, right? Those segments recovered really well and a lot more quickly from COVID. So some of it's year-over-year comps. So I think that you'll always have those, as cycles play out, you'll have those effects, and we really believe in the demand for mid scale. So you could have differences in year-over-year RevPAR growth relative to other chain scales. But in terms of serving tons of customers, we think there's 70 million customers out there in that chain scale or below. And then if you think about -- so for Spark, for mid scale transient, if you think about LivSmart for more extended sort of 30, 60, 90 day extended stay business, we feel really good about the demand profile over the long term and the ability to serve. As Chris said earlier, in one of his answers, serve more customers, bring new customers into the system, but more importantly, deliver great returns for owners and earn more fees. We don't do these things because of how year-over-year RevPAR growth will perform. Now like in these chain scales, we expect to generate premium market share and outperform the competition. But you're going to to continue to have year-over-year in RevPAR growth, and that's not why we do these things.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird.
Michael Bellisario: Sort of a two part just first on development and signings, maybe where are you seeing the wins by brand, by region and kind of outside of the Spark momentum that you just mentioned. And then I guess, just specifically on Spark for the eight or 10 hotels. I know it's still early days there, but what are you thinking in terms of loyalty contribution and sort of earn and burn patterns from Honors members so far?
Kevin Jacobs: So at the beginning, I'd say, look, for the first part of it, Michael, the success has been pretty broad based. I mean 45% up in signings which was up 31% in the US and then obviously a little bit better than that outside of the US and we expect another record year in 2024. And that's just because our brands are performing, industry fundamentals remain good. So despite what people think about economic growth, you're going to be in a supply constrained environment here for a while. And in those environments, we take more share, right? We mentioned we've got one in five rooms under construction more than any other hotel companies. So we have a lot of momentum and owners want to affiliate with us. And then when you get into an environment where capital -- where lending is more constrained, right? Lenders want to see -- they want to lend to projects that are affiliated with our brands. And that's not just a US phenomenon that's around the world because lenders feel like they're more likely to get paid back. And so a lot of it's momentum, it's across all the brands and chain scales and across all the regions. And then the second part of your question, I think -- look, it is early days, it's only a handful of hotels. But I think so far, what we're seeing from the performance of the Sparks is in line market share premiums reasonable to strong loyalty contribution. We do think we're going to sign up a lot more new members with these hotels, because we'll bring new customers into the system. So it's not just a matter of were they a member before they booked but sometimes they book and they become a member while they're there. So I think it is early days but pretty consistent performance across the board there.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.
Richard Clarke: Just going back to SLH. Firstly, is this the luxury lifestyle launch you've teased recently or is that still to come? And then related, I guess, when other companies have done these kind of partnerships, they've seen some criticism that hotels are joining the loyalty program but a lower percentage of their revenues being handed over to Hilton. So how are you going to stop hotels from choosing the SLH route into Hilton Honors rather than maybe joining LXR or Canopy, or one of the other brands where they would pay across all of their revenues, the fee percentage?
Chris Nassetta: The first on luxury lifestyle, no, this is not in lieu of that. We are still hard at work. I've made, I think, pretty clear for a long time, but much clearer lately that we intend this year to enter that space one way or another and we're hard at work. And I think you should expect sometime this year, hopefully sooner than later to see us enter that space. And we think that's something that is totally different than what we're trying to do with SLH. In terms of the value proposition of existing brands versus SLH, as I said in my earlier comments, I mean SLH is something very different than LXR, very different than Canopy, different than Waldorf, different than Conrad, different than everything we have in the sense that these are really very small luxury hotels in very niche markets in a lot of cases, but even within non-niche markets, very niche locations. And as a result, we do not believe that they are in conflict with or cannibalize anything else we're doing, just because -- I mean, I suggest anybody just go on the Web site, they got 500 plus, you can sort of get a feel for it. And I think we did huge amounts of work in terms of overlap analysis to make sure we understood that. I think you could very quickly understand that like this isn't consistent with anything else we're doing. It will be very -- what we do in luxury lifestyle will be very different. What we're already doing with LXR, our luxury soft brand is very different. Those hotels tend to be bigger, hotels, more meeting space and all of those things. So as I said, we're excited. It's very -- as big as we are at 7,500 hotels across all of these chain scales, it's really hard to find something that you would view as this complementary but we worked really hard to find that and we think SLH is that. So we do not believe that -- we believe it will bring in lots of new customers, serve our existing customers, as I said, really well, make them happier as they earn and particularly, they burn points and will not be in conflict either with our existing owners, but more importantly, not be in conflict with our existing growth opportunities and the brands that we already have on the brand park.
Richard Clarke: Maybe if I can just ask one very quick follow-up. Just the gap between the 15% RevPAR growth in owned and lease and the 8% revenue decline, what's leading to that gap in that segment?
Kevin Jacobs: You're talking about the -- yes, it's almost entirely the impact of government subsidies last year in the fourth quarter. I assume if you're looking at year-over-year RevPAR relative to RevPAR growth, which is same store and the subsidies come in below the revenue line.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James.
Bill Crow: Chris, I'm curious, there's quite a debate out there about inbound versus outbound, especially on the leisure side, you said you expect leisure to be up this year. I'm wondering what you're seeing in your system tells you that outbound travel is going to be as strong as last year, or if we're going to see more balanced playing field here in the United States?
Chris Nassetta: I think we're going to see a very strong -- a much stronger inbound year, that doesn't mean outbound is going to be bad. But I think with what happened with the value of the dollar last year and you had the strength there, drove a lot of international travel, particularly to Europe, I don't think -- and people hadn't been in a while, so you put those things together and it created a real groundswell for outbound business. I think there'll be plenty of outbound. But I think the trend this year will be sort of recovering not maybe fully but getting much closer to full recovery by the end of the year on inbound international. The Chinese inbound is the big variable, which is still a small fraction of what it was. I still think that takes a more protracted period of time, just given everything going on in China, but other countries around the world are compensating for that. So we might not get all the way back this year. I think TBD, but I do think for the story, part of the strength this year is going to be about inbound international. And I think part of that will obviously index very heavily towards the big urban markets. And that combined with what I already talked about on the group side, with the resurgence of all the big citywides and association as well as SMB group business that's everywhere, but that's nice for the big cities as well. So I think you're going to see -- I think that will -- when we finish the year, we're going to feel a lot better about inbound and not bad about outbound, but I think inbound will be the story.
Bill Crow: I do have a follow-up question, I'll make it quick here. But you a couple of times have kind of emphasized this low supply growth environment. The development pipeline continues to build. It's actually, I think, at all-time high levels. Your pipeline is a great example. I'm wondering if you're seeing any change in the pace of new construction starts or any indication that the period between signed deals and groundbreaking is starting to shorten? It feels like we got kind of a coiled snake out there, at some point, we're going to see some supply growth take off.
Chris Nassetta: I think you will. I mean, first of all, I mean, our numbers are really good and not to pat us on the back, but we take an unfair share of what is getting signed and an even less fair share of what's getting financed. So our numbers are not indicative of what's going on in the broader market. I think if you look in the broader market, the supply numbers are sort of circa 1%. And in my own view, you're right. Eventually, that will go back up. I mean the 30 year average is 2.5%. So it suggests if you look at long-term trends, it will go up, particularly as strong as the business has been and we think will continue to be into this year. But there are natural limitations in place, which is why you see it at 1%. I mean the 1% is sort of an output of very high cost to build and higher cost of labor, and higher interest rates, no financing availability that occurred over the last couple of years. And so you see that sort of hitting the numbers now. But the reality is while some of those things have stabilized, and that's why our starts were up double digit in the US last year, it's still very hard while financing. Interest rates have come down a little bit. Cost to build has not, but it's stabilized. Obviously, rates have gone up. I mean the economic setup works pretty well, but it really works, it’s obviously really well for us because we drive very high market share and very high rates and higher than almost all of our competitors, so it works better for us. And the financing market, while it's better, okay, that's why we're able to get -- we got a lot more done last year, and I think we'll get a lot more done this year. It's not robust. And so there's a natural sort of gate that exist. And while it's getting better, I think will exist for a while. And it takes time to build these things, right? So the reality is, I think, this year, we'll still be not as constrained but more constrained financing environment that will weigh heavily to our benefit. And then I think it will continue to ease. But I think before you're going to see a lot of this stuff convert for and mass from a pipeline to under construction, particularly here in the US, I think it takes a couple of years, and then it takes a year or two to build the stuff. So I feel pretty darn good about like '24, '25 and probably most of '26 for being pretty meaningfully below the 30 year averages on supply, and that's why I made the comments that I made. I think it's just math. At some point, they got to start to finish.
Operator: The next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with TD Cowen.
Kevin Kopelman: Could you give us an update on how you're thinking about fee growth for the year? If you still expect it to exceed [indiscernible] plus RevPAR, and any kind of puts and takes there?
Kevin Jacobs: We still think -- we think fee growth will be a little bit above algorithm as it normally is. A couple of headwinds, a little bit of headwind from FX, but even with that, we think we'll be above algorithm for fee growth this year.
Kevin Kopelman: And then one other quick one. Could you talk about any plans or your plans to get back into the kind of 3 to 3.5 times leverage range that you talked about?
Kevin Jacobs: Our guidance this year implies we will be approaching the bottom end of that range. We still think it's the appropriate range for us. Obviously, the borrowing environment has been a little bit challenged. We haven't liked where rates have been. We're still -- obviously, our capital return is still moving up, and we've given guidance for this year. But the guidance for this year implies that we'll be approaching the bottom end of that range by the end of the year.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, everybody, again, for taking the time. Obviously, a really good year for us last year, some exciting things going on with SLH, but even the organic growth and increases in unit growth that we see, given the momentum we're taking from last year into this year. We feel really good about the progress of the company. We feel really good about where things are and outlook for the full year. And we'll look forward to catching up with you after the first quarter to give you an update. Thanks again, and have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-10-25 09:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Hilton's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you, MJ. Welcome to Hilton's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Jill, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I wanted to start today by saying that our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the tragic events that are unfolding in the Middle East. Our priority remains the safety and security of our team members and guests as well as helping in any way we can to support the relief efforts for the humanitarian crisis in the region through a number of organizations, including the International Committee for the Red Cross. Turning to results. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with system-wide RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all above the high-end of our guidance ranges. The strength of our brands, power of our commercial engines and resilient business model continue to drive strong top and bottom line performance. This supports meaningful free cash flow generation and greater shareholder returns. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders, and we remain on track to return $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased 6.8% year-over-year, boosted by strong international performance and continued recovery in business transient and group. Demand improved across all segments and regions with system-wide occupancy for the quarter reaching our highest level post-pandemic and only two percentage points off prior peak levels with September just one point shy of 2019. Group RevPAR rose 8% year-over-year, outperforming leisure and business transient RevPAR growth of 5% each. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew 11.4% in the quarter with all segments accelerating sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall performance was driven by both rate and occupancy. Steady rate growth and rising demand drove leisure RevPAR up 29% versus 2019, improving roughly 300 basis points versus the second quarter. Business transient RevPAR grew 7% with both large and small accounts improving. Adjusting for holiday and calendar shifts, mid-week RevPAR increased nearly 500 basis points versus the second quarter. On the group side, RevPAR exceeded 2019 peak levels for the first full quarter since the pandemic and we continue to see positive group booking trends in the quarter for all future periods. Group position for 2024 is now up 18% year-over-year, and lead demand in the quarter for all future arrivals increased more than 15%. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect continued strength in international markets, along with continued improvement in business transient and group demand to drive further acceleration in RevPAR compared to 2019. Better-than-expected third quarter performance and increased expectations for the fourth quarter, partially driven by better group bookings. As a result, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of 12% to 12.5%. Turning to development. We saw another quarter of robust signings with a near-record 35,500 rooms signed increasing 80% year-over-year. Our pipeline now stands at the highest in our history, totaling 457,000 rooms, up 4% versus the second quarter and 10% year-over-year.  Signings in the quarter spanned our portfolio, demonstrating the benefits of a diversified industry-leading family of brands. Conversions accounted for 35% of signings increasing sequentially versus the second quarter. Overall, we remain on track to deliver the highest annual signings in our company's history, surpassing 2019 record levels by double-digit percentage points. We also delivered another strong quarter of construction starts with every major region exceeding our expectations, and the US in particular, delivering its strongest quarter of start since Q1 2020, up 18% year-over-year.  Roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction, and we continue to have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company accounting for more than 20% of industry share. In the quarter, we opened 107 hotels totaling nearly 16,000 rooms, up 22% year-over-year and 12% versus the second quarter. We achieved several milestones in the quarter, including the opening of our 700th hotel in the Asia-Pacific region, and we celebrated our 60th anniversary in Japan. We also opened our 300th lifestyle hotel in our 50,000th lifestyle room, including the global debut of Tempo by Hilton designed with well-being in mind, the brand's first property is now open in the middle of Times Square, New York as part of the TSX development. Additionally, Canopy launched in the south of France with the opening of the Canopy by Hilton Con making Hilton's entry into the city and the latest addition to a growing portfolio of Canopy properties across Europe. Curio celebrated its debut in Savannah, Georgia. Tapestry increased its portfolio with the opening of the Bankers Alley Hotel in Nashville, and Motto expanded its signature flexible design and local vibe with its second hotel in New York City. During the quarter, we also celebrated the debut of our newest cost-effective conversion brand Spark by Hilton, the grand opening of the Spark by Hilton Mystic Groton in Connecticut solidified our foray into the premium economy segment. I just visited the property last week and was blown away. I would encourage any of you that are in the area to go see it. Opening just eight months after launch, Spark is the fastest announcement to market brand in Hilton's history, with more than 400 deals in negotiation; we think this is the start of a journey to reshape the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and our owner base. Announced just five months ago, Project H3 also continues to see tremendous demand with 350 deals in negotiation. In fact, later today, we're breaking ground on the first ever property in Kokomo, Indiana, which we expect to open in late summer 2024. Positive momentum in openings has continued into the fourth quarter with several notable openings in October, including the 540 room Hilton Cancun, Mar Caribe and all-inclusive resorts. Tomorrow, we'll announce and open a 1,000-room conversion property in the Northeast part of the United States. We forecast conversions will account for approximately 30% of full year openings. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. We believe we have hit an inflection point and expect a meaningful uptick in openings in the fourth quarter with continued positive momentum into next year with forecast for our highest level of signings in the air, the largest pipeline in our history, nearing the largest under-construction pipeline in our history with identified 2024 openings and positive momentum in conversions, we are confident in our ability to accelerate net unit growth to 5.5% to 6% next year and to return to our prior 6% to 7% growth rate. In terms of fee contribution, our algorithm is alive and well, and we expect fee growth above RevPAR plus net unit growth going forward. Our under-construction portfolio mix of roughly 60% focused service hotels and 40% full service remains in line with our existing supply. This balanced and diversified pipeline, along with rising RevPAR and royalty rates gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering high quality growth with increasing fees per room. We also continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to more than 173 million members and remains the fastest growing hotel loyalty program. Members accounted for 64% of occupancy, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year. Demonstrating our commitment to meeting the evolving preferences of our guests, we recently announced several new innovations. As part of our long-term commitment to digitally transform the business travel experience for millions of small and medium-sized enterprises, we will launch Hilton for Business early next year. The multifaceted program will feature a new booking website along with targeted benefits designs, especially for SMEs, which account for approximately 85% of our business mix. Additionally, we will expand our events booking capabilities, enabling customers to book meetings and event spaces with or without guestroom blocks directly on our website. For travelers who prioritize sustainability, we recently announced an expanded agreement with Tesla to install up to 20,000 universal wall connectors at 2,000 hotels making our planned EV charging network, the largest in the industry. We also continue to be recognized for our culture. During the quarter, we were named the top hospitality employer in Europe and in Asia by Great Place to Work. And just yesterday, we were named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the United States for the fifth year in a row. The strong results we're reporting today would not be possible without our more than 460,000 team members who spread the light and warmth the hospitality each and every day. Overall, we're very pleased with the performance in the quarter, and we remain very optimistic about the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead with continued strong demand, coupled with our record pipeline and accelerating net unit growth forecast. We're confident in our ability to further differentiate ourselves from the industry in the years ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the results for the quarter and our expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 6.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong international performance as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $834 million in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance and license fee growth. Management and franchise fees grew 12% year-over-year. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.67, increasing 27% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 3% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group. Leisure demand in the US remained strong even with tougher year-over-year comps. Relative to 2019 peak levels, US RevPAR increased 10% in the third quarter, improving 200 basis points versus the second quarter. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 11% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand, particularly in urban locations. In Europe, RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in business travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 19% year-over-year led by both rate growth and strong demand from the summer travel season. In the Asia-Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 39% year-over-year, led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 38% year-over-year in the quarter and 12% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 40% year-over-year. Moving to our guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4.5% and 5.5% year-over-year and 12% to 13% versus 2019 with continued sequential improvement versus the third quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $739 million and $759 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.51 and $1.56. For the full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 12% and 12.5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $3.025 billion and $3.045 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $6.04 and $6.09. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $39 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Yes. Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: Good morning, Chris. So Chris, I think the big incremental here is obviously your 2024 improving net unit growth outlook. I think this is meaningfully better than what people were expecting out there. So you gave some color in terms of what you're seeing on obviously, signings, starts and details. But just help us kind of dig in here a little bit. What would kind of give you the confidence to kind of bump that up from where we were a quarter ago? Is there something in particular you'd like to call out for us? And specifically, just remind us of exactly the activity levels you're seeing here US as we know we're fighting that sort of tougher construction and financing environment for owners broadly, it seems like you're obviously able to buck that trend. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Yes, last quarter, we gave a broad range of five to six, which we felt good about, but a broader range for obvious reasons, we were middle of the year, and there was a lot of year left and thus a lot of time to see what was going to happen in signings and starts and success with conversions and the like. And so -- as you saw from what we just reported on in Kevin's and my comments, we continue to have great success in the third quarter and that's continued in the fourth quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, we're going to have a record year by double-digit percentage on signings. While starts aren't quite back to where they were, they're getting close to being back to where they were. We obviously have an elevated level of conversions from what we've seen in recent years at 30%, which we think is going to continue with across a broad range of brands and of course, including the addition of Spark. And so the confidence we have is at this point in the year, we have a very granular model. This is -- we always have a model, but in the middle of the year, by definition, we just don't have as much information. Now, as I said in my comments quite briefly, we have identified -- a lot of what we're going to deliver next year is identified. Obviously, we have a bunch of conversions that we'll do in the year for the year, but we have a lot -- we've had a lot of success there. And so the confidence is ground up region-by-region, hotel-by-hotel with some, we think, reasonably conservative assumptions for what we'll be able to execute on given the momentum we have in conversions, this is where we end up is 5.5 to 6. And so we wouldn't say it if we didn't believe it and it is a plan that is based on the underlying momentum and things that are largely in production. As I looked at it, I know we get questions all the time about when are you going to get back to six to seven, and we obviously -- and I said in my prepared comments, I have every confidence we will. I think it's possible next year if a few things go our way. I think we could be at the bottom end of that range. But we're still in October 2023. So we're going to take it one step at a time. We refined it. We feel really good about 5.5 to 6, next time we talk, we'll ever find it even more. And as I said, a few things go our way. Honestly, when I look at all of the data in a granular way, I think there's probably more upside potential than downside risk at this point.
Kevin Jacobs: And then Shaun -- just to circle back to the US, I think, look, the story, I mean, you've heard the story about things are a little bit more stressed with financing costs. But I think the story around if you are financed and you're entitled and you're ready to go and you want to build a hotel, you're better off getting underway than leaving that asset as a non-performing asset. And I think that you think about that being fueled also by the fundamental environment where people are optimistic about growth, capacity additions are going to be constrained. We continue to take share. And so I think it's a good story in the US as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, just trying to understand, longer term, the accelerating net rooms growth. How -- on average, how long is the typical full service or the typical limited service hotels staying in the pipeline? Is that time line narrowing? I mean understanding next year's accelerating rooms growth is more a function of past periods gross room signings as well as starts that you're seeing pick up here. But are you seeing the time line room staying in the pipeline narrow at all on a like-for-like basis?
Chris Nassetta: No, I would say every region is a little different. I don't have a hard stat in my head. I'll give you sort of a directional answer. I mean with limited service in the pipeline generally in the pipeline a couple of years, full service, I would say, on the order of three or four years, but it could vary greatly depending on what region of the world you're in. But I think directionally, those are -- if I average it all together, those are pretty good. And I would say what happened during COVID is that extended out a great deal because everything stopped and slowed down and then you have the supply chain issues even after things got moving again, we reopened. You have the supply chain things that slowed things down. That has now come back down to being closer to where we were, but still a little bit more extended than where we were. And I think that has a lot to do with just in a lot of parts of the world, what Kevin just said. It's just a little harder to get things done. And so it's taking a little bit longer. People are getting financed, but if they had five projects they wanted to start, they're maybe getting two or three of those finance and it's taking a little bit longer. So I think there is a little bit longer gestation period. Now when 30% of the deliveries are conversions, obviously, that's a super short gestation period from pipeline into NUG. And so that's helping -- if you take it on average, I would say, with an increase of conversions relative to being in the low 20s right before we were in COVID. I would say the gestation period, the time and pipeline is about the same. Again, I'm doing sort of quick and dirty math in my head. But if you just look at pure new construction, it's a little bit -- it's still a touch longer than it had been. And again, we sort of like not to repeat myself, we factored all of that in, meaning we know we have a team that is on the ground everywhere in the world, working with all of our owners on every project that's under construction and what we think we're going to deliver next year other than the end of the year for the year, which are largely obviously conversions at this point. Those are projects. They're on the ground, they're being -- they're under construction, and we have rational time lines for when we think that those will deliver.
Operator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question. Chris, you said earlier in the call that the kind of fee growth -- you expect fee growth to outpace kind of the NUG plus RevPAR dynamic. I was wondering if you could kind of break down a little bit how to think about the NUG plus RevPAR dynamic for the operating business relative to kind of the fees and whatnot and how we should think about that fee component of that relationship?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. We do get a bunch of questions periodically on like fees per room and they're going up and going down. I mean that's the reason we put it in there. And we'll give you a lot more granularity on that on March 19 of next year when we do a full day or a good part of a day talking about it. But we just -- we put it in there because we wanted to -- we get the question enough. I wanted to publicly how we think about it. I mean, we described years ago when we had our last Analyst Day sort of an algorithm that had same-store growth, new unit growth with leverage associated with fee -- license fee increases and that, that would ultimately give us same-store fee growth or fee growth that would be greater than the combination of those two. And that is the condition that exists today. That's what we see in the business today that as we model the business going forward, we believe that will continue as we look at the models. Why? Because of the things that are happy. We're getting same store. We're adding units, and we continue to see our license fee rates go up as we renew contracts. We have 5% of the system that's sort of on average rolling out every year and getting mark-to-market. And we're moving our -- on a bunch of brands. We're moving our license fees up. So when you factor for all of that, that's how you get it on our -- in our core RevPAR base. And then our non-RevPAR base fees as I think we've said a bunch of times, we're having great success. There's a bunch of different pieces of that. The two biggest pieces of it are our credit card, co-brand business and our HGVC HCV business, both of which we think, over time, will grow at higher than algorithm on average. And so when you put all that together, those are our fees. And that's why our fees, we believe, will be growing greater than sort of RevPAR plus NUG. And that obviously then translates if you just do simple math when you look at fees per room and you add RevPAR growth into that equation and you model it out over time, it's sort of hard if you make those assumptions not to fees per room go up. So people ask us that. We think -- I think the math is pretty easy. That's why we put it in there is just to sort of marker out there. Again, we'll give -- we're going to have -- the reason we want to have an Analyst Day is to do a bunch of different things, but that will be one of them to give everybody a little bit more granularity. But -- and an abundance of sort of transparency, we obviously always have our business model and we think the math -- the arithmetic is pretty straightforward and obviously compelling.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thank you. I was going to touch on key money a little bit, which went up a bit guidance for the fourth quarter, even as conversions are also going up. Can you just remind us of your general approach to key money and how the industry dynamics around key money have been evolving as we think about not only in 4Q, but beyond?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. So, Stephen, first of all, I'd say our overall approach to key money has been very consistent the entire time we've been here. We still have less than 10% of our deals that have any key money associated with them. I think you have to recognize that in a more competitive environment for conversions, those tend to be get a little bit more competitive and a little bit more expensive. But this year, what I would say is it's just we happen to have one -- we upped our guidance for overall CapEx, I should point out that, that's not key money guidance. That's overall CapEx guidance. We upped our guidance. We've been fortunate to win a few relatively large deals at the higher end of the business where they get a little bit more expensive in the fourth quarter. And we had one big deal, as we've told you about that carried over. It really was a last year deal, but didn't end up closing until this year, which caused last year to be lighter this year to be a little bit heavier. If you look at a three-year average we're sort of south of $250 million of total CapEx, the way we guide it. And I think that's the right way to think about it going forward. We think next year will normalize and be back into that sort of low 2s -- low to mid-2s range on a total CapEx basis.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, David.
David Katz: You covered a lot of details and in particular, the NUG acceleration into next year. If you could help us unpack a little bit. Is there some expectation for improvement in the landscape? And I know Kevin mentioned taking share of the opportunities that are out there. How? Is that a function of key money? I'd love to just get a sense for how you're pitching it and why you win?
Chris Nassetta: I would say, built in, I said this is a very granular for next year, it's a very granular analysis. So it's all in production or conversion. So I would say we do think -- the environment is not great, but not bad. I mean things are getting financed. Actually, in a really tough environment, as Kevin implied, we end up taking share. So, we're getting more -- much more than our fair share of the development opportunities. Why? I mean, I'm obviously partial, but I think if you talk to a broad base of owners, I would say because our brands perform better. Our market share is the highest in the industry. And if they're only going to do a few deals. They want to do them and get the highest returns, and so they go to the brands that are going to deliver their best performance. So, I mean, it's clearly it's still a challenging financing environment, although open and slow. We haven't made any big assumption to get to these NUG numbers for next year that something changes wildly. We think it's sort of going to my guess is it will matriculate and get a little bit better because there's a chance at some point next year, rates will come down things. So, we haven't really made that assumption, as I said, because we -- what's going to happen next year is largely in production. But we do think as has been happening this year and for a number of years that we will continue to take share. And we do believe and built into this is that on conversions, again, I said I think we'll be 30 this year. I think we'll be about 30 next year too that we are going to get more than our fair share of conversions. And we have enough momentum that I have the confidence to feel good about giving you the range and outcomes on that basis. And my guess is, as I said, if a few things go our way, we might be able to outperform that we've really definitely hit an inflection point of view. If you really think about the inflection point, it was sort of the second half of last year, you started to see the momentum shift and things bottom out in terms of signings and starts. And I kept saying this to people. I know everybody has been nervous, they're not -- for good reason. But you could -- we can just see like the rack moving through the SNC [ph] so to speak, starting the second half of last year, and now you're starting to see it produce. Third quarter is up a little. You'll see the fourth quarter, we're going to have a very large delivery quarter. And our belief, just given, again, what we know is in production is you've hit a real point of inflection and you're on the way back up. So that's a lot to unpack. I think the core answer is there is no broad assumption of like the world improving from the standpoint of development and financing in any material way from where we are here.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead. 
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to your comments around group business, which looks like it's pacing very well up for next year. And you mentioned as you have before, that 85% is coming from smaller business enterprises. And I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the remaining 15%, which I guess is comprised of larger businesses? And maybe just what you're hearing in terms of their sort of appetite to book into next year at this point?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Thanks, Smedes for the question. I think you may be conflating two different comments. Group is way up 18%, group business on the books for next year. The 85%, I was talking about SMEs was business transient. It does turn out by coincidence that 85% of our group business is small and medium groups, but that's a total coincidence. And 15% of it is sort of large, I'd say, 300-room plus groups. As we look at next -- as you look at sort of implied, I think, in some of the comments I've already made or in the prepared comments, what's going to happen next year is that it will start. I still think group business has always been dominated by just like business travel, business transient by small and medium groups. But you will see the return of the mega groups that started in the second half of this year. It takes a long time to plan these things and think about it last year. Nobody wanted to commit them much because they didn't know we were still in the open close, open close. They got to spend millions of dollars planning these events, they can't get out of them, there's penalties and everything else. So, people waited a long time, and then it takes -- then they got to get a space and it's getting much, much harder to get space for these city-wides and the big groups. So that just takes time. I think it will shift next year not radically, but I think you will see a decent shift to an orientation to the large groups because they have a huge amount of pent-up demand that needs to be satiated. And so that's going to start happening next year. My guess is you'll see a big surge in it, it will shift the stats around. Over time, I think it's probably like -- I don't have a hard data point, but sort of directionally having done this a long time. I think it's like 80-20, something like that more normally. And so I think next year, you're going to get -- you're going to get more of that instead of 85%, 15%, you're going to see the bigger groups take a leap up in the short to intermediate term to get to a more normal environment. But we're seeing sort of underneath the question, I assume, is what are we seeing in strength from small, medium, big, whatever. We're seeing -- if we sat in this very room with our sales team as we do every quarter and went through it all. We're seeing strength in everything. Group is just off the hook, strong tons of demand, peak groups or lead times are lengthening because the obvious, right? Now everything -- there's not been a lot of group hotels that have been built in this country for essentially 20 years. And so you have all this demand, you have fewer places to go. So, groups have to start planning further in advance and booking much, much further out. And so -- the demand is very good. We've not seen -- notwithstanding a lot of noise in the environment about like where is the economy going and the like for next year. It's not -- we've not seen any real impact in terms of group demand at this point to the contrary. Our teams are saying they're doing everything they can to keep up with demand.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Kevin, the fourth quarter RevPAR guidance looks strong, not out of the arena of your third quarter RevPAR growth. And you don't see that sort of translate into EBITDA year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter versus sort of the third quarter. Just wondering if there's timing you want to highlight between the two quarters or anything else and why that would be a little bit diverging?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure, happy to, Brandt. I think, yes, obviously, we raised our guidance about the amount of the third quarter. We did increase the top line for the fourth quarter a little bit, not huge, and it is flowing through, say, for there's a little bit of timing in corporate expense, a little bit of FX and then a small amount for Israel. That's really it.
Operator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask returning to the topic of unit growth. The conversion percent next year, you said about 30% as well in 2024. Can you give us a sense of sort of typically in October of the prior year, how much of those conversions would be kind of already on your books versus how much would come in sort of in the year -- for the year you don’t have as much visibility on just kind of understand the visibility there? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: It's a great question, I wish I had a great answer. Every year sort of widely different I would say less than half, it's not nothing, but a lot of the work gets done in the year. But I would say, if I had to guess that it half, maybe a bit less would be 40% to 50% would be on the books one way or another or maybe not in -- it wouldn't be in the pipeline, but it would be in some form of negotiation. I would say 40% to 50% would be in some form of negotiation.
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone. The question about how you're thinking about upcoming corporate rate negotiations for 2024? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. We feel pretty good about it. I mean we're in the -- just getting into the thick of it. We're never near done. Keeping in mind, it's a relatively small part at this point of the business. This is like 6% of our business given that we have really pushed hard on the SME side of the business, and that's 85% of the business. So when you whittle it down, it's about 6% of the business. But we think at this point, when you add it all together, the fixed and the dynamic, most of our pricing is dynamic at this point. It's probably in the upper single-digits.
Operator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I'll ask you to pull out your crystal ball for a second. Could you share some high-level thoughts on, which regions have the most RevPAR growth potential into 2024? Are you thinking maybe next year is more of a domestic growth driven year or more of the same with international leading? Does the regional leadership change into 2024?
Chris Nassetta: I think it will be -- I mean, I think it will be reasonably balanced between the US and Rest of World, maybe a smidge lower in the US than Rest of World, but not too terribly different, at least based on what we're seeing now. And then for Rest of World, I think we see positive growth everywhere, by the way. We don't see a region where we will not have growth. We're in the middle of budget season, so it's slightly premature to judge exactly where it will be. But if you said to me, where do we think it would be recognizing we're early in the process. I would say low to mid-single-digit global RevPAR growth. And we'll, obviously, on the next call, we'll give you a refined view when we have finished the whole process. But again, I would think that would be Rest of World a little bit higher, US, not too terribly different, and the one that would lead the pack again would be Asia-Pacific for a bunch of reasons, most notably China, which, if you recall, just in terms of comps, China did open up and is now doing really well, but the first part of this year was not. So, you will have a very strong start given everything that's happening in China in the business, which there's a lot of noise about China in their economy. But from a travel tourism point of view, in China, it's very, very strong now. We think that will carry into the beginning of the year, and then you'll have some easy comps. So, we think from a pure what will RevPAR year-over-year growth point of view, where would the regions be, I would say, China and thus, APAC will lead the charge. But they're going to - I would say, given we think it will probably be in the low to mid-single-digits, they're going to converge a little bit more. And now the world because China is open, is all -- you're getting out of sort of these COVID comp issues and you're getting almost to sort of a normalized world where you have comps where everybody was open from COVID other than, as I say, the first part of the year in China, the first part of 2024 comparability issue.
Operator: The next question comes from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just in terms of occupancy versus rate discussion, I guess, more focused on occupancy. Chris, can you talk about how we should think about occupancy exiting 2023 as a percentage or decline versus 2019? And then more importantly, is there still a day of the week that just hasn't come back? Should occupancy permanently be a couple of hundred basis points off? Just trying to think about this in the medium term? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, I said in the prepared comments that in Q3, we actually were only 200 basis points off. And in September, we were only 100. So I think we're going to exit this year getting closer and closer to prior levels of occupancy for the industry, but at least for Hilton. I think as we get into next year, particularly as we're able to build the group base, which is if you really look at what's happening and you're getting midweek business back, leisure is obviously still strong, weekends are still stronger than they were. What's really happened, particularly in a lot of the big cities in the US is you don't have the group base back. Well, you've seen recovery, you don't have that big group base to leverage the rest of the business off of. And as already commented, we think you're going to have a really robust group year just given where bookings are right now that then is, I think, sort of the last leg of the stool allowing you to get back to occupancy levels comparable to 2019. So, I suspect next year, we will -- as that -- as you go through the year and you get that group base back, I think the rest of the segments feel very good. I mean, I know everybody wants to say, nobody is going to travel for business, but that's just that people are traveling like crazy, look around and the makeup of there's some industries technology and financial services that haven't rebounded as much and have issues like over hiring and then reduction in workforce and all that. But again, the bulk of it is driven by SMEs and they're traveling more than they were. And most of the corporates and even those corporates the people they still do have are traveling more. So I don't -- I do not -- I do believe we will get back to prior levels of occupancy. I think it will happen next year. I think we're getting -- we're not quite there, but we're getting close. I think next year, as you think about the split between rate and occupancy, it's a little early, but I would say it's probably a pretty balanced equation as between the two next year. I mean, certainly, it's early look.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask on luxury. Maybe just remind us where is the white space today as you see it? And then maybe more importantly, what are your customers still asking for as you think about investing key money dollars at the higher end price point?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think that the white space for us is luxury lifestyle. We've talked about it a bunch. We are doing a bunch of work in the space right now. I think next year, we will come out -- we will have a product in the market next year. So we've done a lot of work over many years, but we sort of cranked up that engine once we got Spark launched in H3 out there. That's sort of next. I think our customers, listen, I think our customers love what we have. I mean, as reflected in the fact that loyalty is amongst the largest and is certainly the fastest growing. And I think we -- I know we still represent the highest level of engagement in the sense of Honors occupancy being higher than anybody in the industry. So, I think our customers are saying to us the ecosystem that you've created, both how you do loyalty, the products you have, the geography, what we talk about frequently, the network effect that we've built combined with Honors and experiences related to Honors and how they engage with Honors is really working well. So, I don't think there is anything that if I'm being really blunt that our customers are screaming out, I just sat in 12 hours of focus groups with customers because we're going through a strategic planning process for over two nights with every segment of customers, people are loyal to us, not loyal to us, et cetera, et cetera. There was -- I mean there's a lot to unpack there. I'm not going to do it on this call, but there was nothing that our customers were saying like, gosh, you need this and you need that. Look, what we do know is that having more on the high end creates even more of a halo effect. We believe we have a significant amount already in the luxury space, in the resort space. And given our scale and breadth and depth geographically, we think it's very pleasing to our Honors members. But on the margin, having more of it, we think, is beneficial, which is why we spend the time doing it. It's why we want to do luxury lifestyle. The other reason really not only do we want our customers to have more opportunities at the high end, but we're just giving away, if I'm being honest, we're just giving away development opportunities. I'm looking at Kevin, who runs development, too. It's like I travel all over the world. We have owners that are super loyal to us, and many of them want to build a luxury lifestyle hotel, and we don't really have a product for them. And so literally, they're doing it with other people just because we don't have a product, and that makes me crazy, so that I think that it will obviously enhance our growth rate. Now, luxury lifestyle is not like H3 or Spark or Tempo or Home2 -- it's not -- not -- it's a very bespoke thing. You're not going to have thousands of these. You're not even going to have hundreds of these. I mean, look at people who have been at it for a long, long time. You'll be fortunate to have dozens of them. But every room counts and having more really high-quality products in the right locations, we think continues to build our network effect. And so I've said this many times to many investors, I sort of love where we are which is we have a -- we have a network effect that works. We have 173 by end of the year, beginning of next year, we'll have 200 million Honors members that are very loyal to us. They love Honors. They love the network that we've created. They love the brand diversification, the geographic diversification. And so there is really doing luxury lifestyle is fabulous, doing more luxury deals with Waldorf, Conrad and LXR, we'll keep doing that. Those will add to growth, but there is -- the ecosystem works. I think point in case is the success that Honors is having vis-à-vis the competition. So, I look at these as all like incremental halo incrementally. Obviously, we can always make it better. And we can always add -- want to add products that add to our growth rate. And we think luxury lifestyle will.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Mr. Crow your line is open.
Chris Nassetta: Hey Bill, are you there?
Bill Crow: I'm sorry, Chris. Good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Bill Crow: Chris, Kevin and Jill. Quick two-parter on maybe the last question, I'm not for today.
Chris Nassetta: A lot in that question.
Bill Crow: Well, a couple of specific questions. First of all, the headlines surrounding Country Garden in China are getting any better. And I'm just wondering as it regards the pipeline as opposed to the already constructed and opening units, what do you think the risk is to that pipeline as you stand today? The second part of the question is more specific on the key money, and we understand the hotel you're going to announce the conversion on tomorrow is in Boston, the reports are circulating that's a $40 million key money payment. I'm just trying to figure out the economic state out of payment like that.
Chris Nassetta: Let me -- I'll maybe tackle both Kevin can jump in. On Country Garden, it is not a huge component of our overall pipeline yet in China. And so I don't feel like there's any risk. And certainly, the guidance we're giving you on NUG anticipates what we think conservatively will happen there. Having said, Country Garden obviously has a lot of issues, but this venture is a totally separate entity apart from their residential business. They remain very committed to it. They have very rigorous milestones that they have to meet in order to keep the exclusivity with Home2. And if they don't, we have all sorts of options that we could move forward on doing it ourselves, et cetera, et cetera. So, Home2 is very well received by the Chinese customer and very well received by the owner community recognizing Country Garden is not building any of these. This is a MOA, where we're going out with them, and these are franchisees that are doing it, and it's not their money. It's individual property owners, developers in all these little regions of China. And so it's not a capital drain for them. They like it. It's profitable, and I think they'll stick with it. If they don't, ultimately, we have all sorts of mechanisms. If they don't meet the milestones, it's not like we have to wait very long. I suspect they will -- what they're saying to me and to us is they remain very committed to it. So I think we -- I think it's fine. I think come to the key ingredient to it is super popular, super profitable on the ones that we've opened up in the development community just like I love Home2 in the US, the development community in China loves it. So that means that we're going to get a bunch of Home2s done. Hopefully, it's with them. If it's not, we'll do it ourselves. On the deal we talked about without naming it, we're not going to name it, we would have named it if we could. So we're not going to comment on specific deals and individual key money. The way to think about it broadly is on big, complicated city center, full service or luxury, those are the deals that end up drawing -- I mean being most of the key money we spend. As Kevin said, less than 10% of our deals and our pipeline by number have any form of balance sheet support. And disproportionately, it's those kinds of deals, they're more competitive, they're more strategic in certain locations where we may have lesser density of distribution where it's really important to us. And in every single case, we are making money. I mean, we are never giving key money, and I'm not going to comment on individual deals. We're never giving key money that doesn't have us make -- creating value in a contract that is significantly higher than the key money contribution. Obviously, that's -- we're a for-profit business. We just don't approach it that way. So every deal is profitable and 90%-plus of them are infinitely profitable because we put nothing into.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Obviously, very pleased with Q3, but more importantly, pleased with the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter, I feel pretty good about next year. We'll get back to you on exactly what we think as we get through our budget process. But given the macro view of what next year is going to be like and the pent-up demand, particularly in group, but also in business travel, we feel very good about it. And obviously, we talked a lot about NUG today. We tried to give you a much more granular view of that. We feel good that we've hit a point of inflection and we're on the road to getting back to our 6% to 7% growth rate. So we got a busy end of the year to make all that happen and get set up for next year. We'll get back to it, and we'll look forward to getting back with you after the year is over.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-07-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Chapman: Thank you, MJ. Welcome to Hilton's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the Company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today. We're excited to report strong second quarter results with RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and EPS exceeding our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter had a record $811 million, the highest single quarter in our company's history. Performance continued to be driven by solid fundamentals, along with continued share gains. Our industry-leading brands, strong commercial engines and powerful partnerships continue to strengthen our system and differentiate us from the competition while a culture of innovation continued to fuel additional growth opportunities. Despite macro challenges over the near term, we're confident in our ability to continue driving solid top line and bottom line growth and, in turn, growing free cash flow. Given the strength of our results thus far and our expectations for the rest of the year, we're increasing our guidance for return of capital for the full year to between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. Turning to results in the quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 12.1% year-over-year as strong demand drove continued pricing power across all segments. System-wide occupancy improved four points during the quarter to reach 77% in June, our highest level post pandemic. Business transient RevPAR remained strong, growing 11% year-over-year as trends continue to normalize. Leisure RevPAR increased 7% versus last year, driven by solid rate growth and despite more difficult year-over-year comparisons. Group recovery remained robust in the quarter with RevPAR growing 19% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, system-wide RevPAR grew more than 9% in the quarter with all segments performing well versus prior peaks and accelerating sequentially versus the first quarter. Stable demand and rising rates drove leisure RevPAR growth of 26% versus 2019 and business transient growth of 6% and group RevPAR was roughly flat versus prior peak levels and improved versus the first quarter. As we look to the back half of the year, we expect continued strength driven by recovery in international markets, business transient and group demand. On the group side, we continue to see very positive trends. Our bookings in the quarter for 2024 arrivals grew 30%, with group position now at 13%, up driven by the corporate segment. And our sales team saw the largest revenue bookings in our history for all future arrival periods. Based on all of that, we now expect full year RevPAR growth of between 10% and 12%. Turning to development. We signed more than 36,000 rooms in the second quarter, representing the largest quarterly signs in our history. Conversions accounted for nearly 1/3 of signings in the U.S. Signings in international markets doubled versus last year, accounting for roughly half of system-wide signings in the quarter, driven by strong momentum across Europe and Asia Pacific. In Europe, we signed agreements across 14 countries, including our first Tapestry Hotel in the French Riviera and our first Curio in Croatia. In China, Hilton Garden Inn continued to show tremendous growth since launching our new franchise business model. In the quarter, we signed approximately 3,700 HCI rooms in China more than 3x last year and accounting for more than 1/3 of our signings in China. Signings in America were up 20 in the Americas were up 25 year-over-year with strong interest in the U.S. despite tighter credit conditions. We've signed more than 50 true hotels year-to-date, representing the strongest pace since 2017 as the operating success of existing true properties is linked to a surge in new signings. Results were further helped by Spark with approximately 60 hotels signed and another 400 in negotiation just six months since its launch. Nearly all deals are conversions from third-party brands and half represent new owners to Hilton, with our first park scheduled to open in September and roughly 20 by year-end, Spark is well positioned to disrupt the premium economy segment while expanding our customer and owner base, especially in markets where there is no Hilton brand presence today. In addition to the strong start for Spark, we recently launched an inventive new extended stay brand in the U.S. Under the working title Project H3, the apartment-style accommodations are designed for guests booking 20 or more nights built with the staying power of Hilton's award-winning hospitality. We have received tremendous interest from owners and developers due to the strong market opportunity, cost-efficient build and high-margin model, and we currently have more than 300 deals in negotiation. Our system-wide pipeline now stands at a record 3,000 properties totaling approximately 441,000 rooms, increasing 7% year-over-year and 3% from last quarter. Following another strong quarter of starts, up more than 73% year-over-year roughly and over 40% year-to-date, roughly half of our pipeline is currently under construction. We have more rooms under construction than any other hotel company ensuring guests will have even more options to stay with us in the years to come. Specifically in the U.S., our under construction pipeline has continued to increase, up 15% year-over-year which will contribute to increased openings later this year and next. In fact, in the coming weeks, we're going to open nearly 2,000 additional hotel rooms in New York Times Square with the debut of our first-ever tempo by Hilton than a new tri-brand property featuring Home2 Suites, Hampton Inn and Motto. In the quarter, we celebrated several milestones, including the openings of our 2,900 Hampton Inn and our 600 Home2 Suites property, which remains one of the fastest-growing brands in the industry. Additionally, we surpassed 150,000 rooms in Asia Pacific, including the openings of the Hilton Okinawa, Miyako Island Resort in Japan and the Conrad Shenzhen, our first luxury hotel in China's thriving technology hub. We expect openings to accelerate as the year progresses given strong international and conversion trends and expect conversions to account for around 30% of openings. For the full year, we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. With forecasts for our highest level of signings, the largest pipeline in our history and approaching the largest under-construction pipeline in our history, we expect net unit growth to accelerate to 5% to 6% next year and to return to 6% to 7% over the next couple of years. As part of our commitment to deliver exceptional experiences for guests, we remain focused on initiatives to drive increased loyalty and satisfaction. We know, for instance, that food and beverage experiences are an integral part of travel and want to ensure our hotels themselves are great dining destinations. We recently formed a first-of-its-kind partnership with the James Beard Foundation serving as the premier sponsor of the 2023 restaurant and Chef awards and continue expanding our partnerships with world-class talents such as Michael Mina, Jose Andres, Nancy Silverton and Paul McGee. Hilton Honors remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program with more than 165 million members, up 20% year-over-year, driven by strong growth across all major regions. Honors members accounted for 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up 2 points year-over-year. Hilton team members and our award-winning culture continue to differentiate our brands from the competition, just yesterday, our Waldorf Astoria Home2 and Tru brands were named best in category by J.D. Power for their respective segments in North America. Last week, Hilton was again named as a top employer for millennials for the sixth consecutive year. Since 2016, we've been recognized by Great Place to Work as the world's best hospitality company in over 60 countries. We're thankful for the great work our team members do to serve our guests around the world. We have incredible opportunities ahead to further position ourselves as the leader in hospitality, and we're very excited for the future of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a few more details on the quarter and expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 12% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. Growth was driven by strong demand growth in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $811 million in the second quarter up 19% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Performance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, largely due to better-than-expected RevPAR performance as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan, benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 16% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.63 increasing 26% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 6% year-over-year with performance led by continued recovery in both business transient and group segments. Leisure demand in the U.S. remained strong but grew more modestly year-over-year due to tougher comparisons. In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 22% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong group demand particularly at our resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 26% year-over-year. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 30% year-over-year, led by rate growth and strong demand from our [logis] travel. In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was up 79% year-over-year led by the continued demand recovery in China. RevPAR in China was up 103% year-over-year in the quarter, an 18-point sequential improvement from the prior quarter and 3% higher than 2019. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw significant growth with RevPAR, excluding China, up 52% year-over-year. Moving to guidance. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 4% and 6% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $790 million and $810 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.60 and $1.65. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.975 billion and $3.025 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.93 and $6.06. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $40 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And as Chris mentioned earlier, we now expect to return between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion for the full year. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible so, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. MJ, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Maybe the first question relates to your net unit growth target for this year, approximately 5% versus the 5% to 5.5% previously. Can you talk about what's driving that? I mean how specific to the U.S., is that -- can you talk about the rate of China development recovery? And then obviously, we all heard what your expectations are for next year in terms of net rooms growth. What gives you the confidence for that acceleration? And what specifically, whether it's brand or geographies is driving that acceleration?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, great question. And no, I'm not surprised that, that would be the first question. For the record, I think, on the last call, probably three different times I said around 5%. So the truth is, since our last call, I don't think our view has really changed much about where our NUG would be this year. And so it is what it is, it was always a bit back-end loaded. And the simple reason for that, Joe, is in the numbers. If you look at starts, what's been happening with starts, we had a big surge in starts in the second half of last year. Starts were up second half of '22, 40%. And if you look at what they are in the first half of this year, as I stated in my introductory comments, they're up 40%. So that means that a bunch of stuff is just translating into the second half of this year and into next year. And so it really is entirely sort of the timing of -- in the sequencing of how that happens. So, we thought it would be around 5%. We still think it will be around 5%. Our confidence in going back on the way back up, I do feel like -- if we look at the data, it's not just pure optimism, although everybody knows I'm an optimistic sort. I mean if you look at the data, as I already said, starts were way up in the second half of last year. They've been way up in the first half of this year we continue to see good momentum there. Same with signings, I mean, we expect, as I said in my comments, have a record year in signings relative to our prior peak and that -- all of those things are translating into both our optimism about the second half of this year being much stronger than the first half and 2024 being much, much better. It's a bunch of different things that are contributing to that. It's really all regions, even though arguably the U.S. credit conditions are -- make it more challenging. As I already said, we're still up year-to-date over the last -- over the trailing 12 months, 15% in starts. And we have some other nice things that are going to add to our growth here in the United States with Spark. We're only going to open 20 this year. You should assume we're going to open a lot more than that next year and Home3 will start contributing H3 will start contributing next year, probably not a ton, but that is a much more financeable product, even in today's environment because it's probably more apartment than it is a hotel. We are broadly having really good success on conversions and Europe, which had been slow, has really started to pick up. And Asia Pacific really led by China has woken up and the engines have not just restarted, but they're really starting to fire on many more cylinders, I wouldn't say it's all the way there yet, but in the second quarter and our expectation for third and fourth is we're going to start to get a very good momentum. And so that's why we feel pretty darn good on the NUG for next year. Obviously, for giving you a range, I would sort of direct you to the middle of it. If some things go our way and the world stays relatively stable, I think we can be mid-range of that or above, but it's a little bit early in the year to go quite that far. We'll, obviously, next quarter and the following quarter, we'll update you. But I think -- what I would say to people is, again, it's objectively based on things that success we're having in conversions, the success we're having in demand for Spark, conversions all over the world, Spark here. By the way, we will take Spark to Europe relatively quickly. And just what we have in the pipeline, I mean, almost half of our pipelines under construction more than anybody in the industry. And once they start, they almost always finish. So that pickup starting in Q3 last year is starting to pay dividends. And thankfully, the pickup in starts has continued everywhere in the world. And as I said, the world is a big place. So there's a little bit more pressure in the U.S. even though the numbers are still good but a lot less pressure in some other parts of the world that had been feeling it, which is the benefit of a big diversified global business.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: I guess if we've covered the net unit growth side. Chris, I'll ask a little bit of the same around sort of the RevPAR outlook. I'd like to gear it to sort of incremental kind of changes or upside for the second half? Just kind of what's the biggest difference to kind of your prior outlook that gave you some confidence there? And then just any pressures or concerns you're seeing on the leisure normalization point. It's a question we take a lot and just kind of maybe update us on the latest you're seeing as we move through some of these really tough comps in the summer. How is behavior out there? And what's going better or a little worse than anticipated at this point?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, happy to. So yes, we moved our numbers up for the second half of the year and thus impacted the full year. That was set on the basis that we're just seeing better results. We -- as we say very regularly, we're not economists, so we try and take the consensus view of what's going on in the macro. The consensus view last quarter was that the second half of the year would see a little bit more meaningful slowdown. I think the consensus for you right now, I mean, you can pick somebody, but it broadly is that it's going to slow down, but it's more of a soft landing and later in the year and more into next year. And so when we factor for that and we look at the momentum, obviously, we've already booked a half a year and we look at what we have reasonable sight lines now into the third quarter, which we feel very good about. And as we look at the fourth quarter, we would probably say the macro views that things will slow. And so we've assumed that, but probably the macro view is that they saw a little bit less than maybe last quarter. And so when you flush all that through, it results in an increase in our guidance. Now there's possible upside if the fourth quarter keeps going like we saw in the second and what it looks like we're going to see in the third, there may be potential. But it certainly warrant increasing our guidance based on where -- what we've already booked for the year, what we see at a macro view in the late part of the year. I mean the interesting thing is like everybody wants to will the business backwards, but we don't really see it. I gave you the stats on leisure, business transient and group. I gave you some sense of where we have really good forward-looking information, which is really on the group segment remaining really, really strong. I mean, obviously, leisure is growing at a somewhat slower pace because of the comps, but I mean it's still way over the prior high watermarks and business transient keeps grinding up and getting better and the same with group. So, as I'm sitting here today, honestly, while we will take a macro view of later in the year because we're not economists, we're not seeing any signs of weakness. I know there's a lot of questions on the leisure business. I mean what I would say to you is like we're not seeing -- we're having it a wildly strong summer in leisure. I mean the only places where leisure has backed off a bit is where you would expect it, where it's normalizing from like crazy highs. It's still in those markets, which I'll talk about way over '19 levels. But I mean it's just sort of coming back, not even to earth, but sort of in our universe, I guess. And those are markets like South Florida, Hawaii, parts of Southern California where it was just like it was insane. But broadly, we have a very diversified leisure business. Broadly, we're not really -- again, other than comps being harder, we continue to see good growth, and we expect to -- and at least what sight lines we have in the business transient, talking to a bunch of customers, which I've done very recently. And certainly, our sales team talks to them all the time, and we got everybody together as we always do last week to talk about it. They're feeling quite good, particularly the SMBs, which is at this point, 85% plus of our business. They're traveling more. They're feeling reasonably good about soft landing in their business. And then group and there's pent-up demand there and group, there's still huge amounts of pent-up demand that haven't been released, as I said, we're -- we had the best booking quarter in our history ever in the second quarter and our position is great for next year. And you're still not where you're going to be with all the big associations because that was really driven by corporate group. So a bunch of the big association groups, I mean, they are booking, but that's multiyear booking cycles, that's still to come. And so we don't see weakness. Obviously, we're sentient and we know what the Fed is trying to do. We'll hear this afternoon, what the next steps are? I expect they are going to raise rates. But I do think we're probably getting to the end-ish of that tightening cycle. Inflation is coming down, some of the lag caters that will eventually come into the inflation numbers. Housing in particular, is definitely real time coming down and will eventually show up. And so, I do think -- we'll see. Again, I'm not an economist, but I do think consensus view is starting to center around a softer landing, maybe late this year or sometime next year. And that feels rational based on everything going on. And as I said, our business, we're not seeing any real cracks anywhere. And of course, the places in the world that had been lagging are now starting to like produce. So, the most significant lag everywhere was doing really well, but China -- and now China is eclipsing prior high watermarks and getting going on development, as I already said, but also operationally, eclipsing 2019 numbers. So not to be a [indiscernible], it all feels pretty good and if we can orchestrate a slowdown but a reasonably soft landing, I think the rest of this year is going to be very solid and in line or better than what we said. And I think next year will be a darn good year because I still think there'll be strength in leisure. But particularly, there'll be if you get a reasonably decent slowdown soft landing, you're going to have continued growth in business transient, particularly with SMBs, which is the vast majority of the business. And group is going to be pretty sticky because people just have to do some of the stuff and particularly in a soft landing environment, I don't think you're going to see a big change there, anytime soon. So, it's early. I'm not going to -- like, obviously, I'm not going to give guidance yet for next year. We're not it's sort of crazy to do that. We got a lot of year to see how things play out. But I sit here today, I feel quite good about the rest of this year. I actually feel quite good about as we later this summer, get into budget season, how we feel about next year. And that's reflected, as you not surprisingly. And the guidance we're giving the increase in our return of capital, I mean I think that should be read for what it is.
Operator: The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: I know you don't want to get 2024 guidance, but if we go all the way back to the split off, you had outlined this algorithm of 1% to 3% RevPAR growth kind of translating to 14% to 23% EPS algorithm with kind of 6% NUG. You're talking about the reacceleration of NUG basically in that range. But what other changes in the business should investors be thinking through as we compare and contrast that algorithm to today whether it's thinking about royalty rates or pipeline or other fees?
Chris Nassetta: I think that the algorithm stands. I mean -- and in fact, even -- by the way, while NUG has been a little bit lower, RevPAR has been higher. I mean it's a pretty perfect hedge, meaning -- we've been running a little lower on one a little higher on the other. My guess is it's going to flip around over the next couple of years. And as I said, we're going to get back to 6% to 7% and same-store growth is going to normalize. But we think the algorithm is alive and well and will deliver at those -- in those ranges that we've talked about as a result of increased growth rates from where we are, increased license fee rates, overall RevPAR growth, the deals that we've done on the licensing side, which generally drag us up because they're at or above algorithm growth rates. We feel very good about that algorithm that we laid out in 2016 that it's alive and well in producing. And as a result, we're producing today more free cash flow than we ever had in history, which is what allows us to return so much capital. Again, that will keep -- both of those things will keep going up as well.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: I wanted to talk about just the strategic philosophies around brands. You've been highly productive at launching brands and just observing that a lot of the growth has been sort of in the middle and mid-scale and limited service, et cetera. How do you think about launching stuff potentially at the higher end? Or do you not sort of want or need those? Or -- and just help us understand how you decide where to launch.
Chris Nassetta: Sure, David. Thanks. Really good question. So yes, I got here with Kevin and others about 16 years ago, and this company had brands that were pretty good, but not performing that well today, we have 22 brands. So we have, I think, really built a very powerful sort of engine of innovation to figure out what customers want, what segments we're missing and to give them more of what they want and do it with very high-quality brands and then deliver commercial performance that's winning performance and market-leading performance is that we attract lots of capital. I don't think we have a brand and we have some that are early, but I don't think we have a brand. I know we don't that isn't performing at -- either equal to or above everybody in the space. And so listen, I say that sort of patting us on the back because I'm very proud of that. Every company has different strategies. We think this strategy is a winning strategy because it delivers better products for our customers over time that meet the market in a modern context, and it's better from a return point of view because we're doing it with blood, sweat and tears and not investing capital. And so it's an infinite return and better for the customers is sort of how do you not like it. Many of those brands, not all, and I'll talk about that, have been in the mid-market. Why? Because that's the biggest opportunity. And so we're trying to serve any customer for any need to have anywhere they want in the world. But obviously, we have focused a lot on where the big markets are, where the big addressable TAMs are total addressable markets. And there's no way you could debate that every segment is important, but the mid-market is where the people are. I mean the big demographic trend in the world. I don't have to tell anybody on this call is growing middle classes all over the world, right? And that's where the money is and those people can afford mid-market hotels. And so when you wake up in 10 or 20 years, the bulk of the rooms growth in the world, that's the bulk of the money that's going to be made is in the mid-market. So that's why we have focused there. But we have not focused exclusively there. We've done a bunch of things in the lifestyle space, with Urban Micro like Motto, with Tempo with Canopy at the upper upscale lifestyle segment. And obviously, in the luxury space, we have made huge strides. I mean, Waldorf existed but wasn't really a brand and Conrad was not much to speak about. And LXR didn't exist. And so, we've gone from essentially a few hotels to 100 world-class luxury hotels with another nearly 60 in the pipeline. And by the way, I said it, but this morning, if you look at Bloomberg or whatever, Waldorf Astoria was ranked the number one luxury brand Eclipse Ritz-Carlton and customer satisfaction in North America. So, we're making really good strides there. And I think there are more opportunities. I would say, listen, we've talked about this for a long time. And the only reason we haven't done it is because we've had other market opportunities that we thought would drive, would serve more customers, drive higher growth and create more value for shareholders, but luxury lifestyle is definitely -- I mean, we're in and around the lifestyle segment, LXR, to a degree is sort of luxury lifestyle. But we don't have a pure hard brand in the luxury lifestyle. Yes, we will. I would say we're doing developmental work there. We want to give our babies spark and H3. While H3, we need to give a name, which we're close to. And then we need to make sure they become little toddlers and are successful but we're doing developmental work in luxury lifestyle. I would expect in the next year, we'll launch something in that space to sort of add to the three brands we have already in the luxury space to give us another shot on goal for luxury opportunities around the world. But the -- and so luxury and lifestyle are hugely important to us because customers like it, and we give them lots and lots of opportunities, but again, the big mass market opportunity every -- in every major market in the world, is the mid-market. And so, we are not ashamed of saying we are -- we have every intention to have the best brands in every market to serve mid-market because we think that's where the most money will be made over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years.
David Katz: Understood, and if I can just follow up on one detail and if I'm over beating the horse, apologies. With respect to the NUG for the remainder of this year, I just want to be as clear as possible about whether there was some on tough comps pull forward or any projects that have slid into next year that are elevating.
Chris Nassetta: I'm not really. I mean not really. As I said in the last call, I said around 5%. And if you go listen to it, maybe three times I mean a little bit, although it's not meaning -- I mean, listen, we were hoping from the standpoint of the momentum that we have in Spark. We were hoping to have 50 hotels open this year, I think by the last quarter, we realized that, that wasn't going to happen. But we're going to have, as I said, we're going to probably have 20. There's no problem. I mean we have 400 deals in negotiation with hundreds more coming over the threshold. It's just -- and the supply chain stuff is now set up and moving. It was a lot of moving parts as we get set up. And so -- that probably has a teeny bit of impact. I mean 20 to 50 is a few thousand rooms, but otherwise, not really -- No. I mean, again, I said around 5%. I'm still -- we still think it's around 5.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, David, I think not to go too far on. I think I'd just add that there's a reason why we signaled last quarter, another quarter has gone by. So, the second quarter is sort of in terms of openings played out the way we were thinking it would, which is why we were signaling we weren't yet ready to adjust the official guidance. All we've done now is crystallized with a happy year in the books and have a year left that what we thought was going to happen in the second quarter happened. And then if you think about the momentum, I mean, Chris already talked about this, but the momentum in approvals and starts, I'd say, it was a better experience in the second quarter than we were expecting a quarter ago.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you a little bit about occupancy levels. When we look at the U.S. data, and I think is true for Hilton versus 2019 is a reasonable sort of gap to prior peak occupancy levels or pre-pandemic occupancy levels. But it sounds like from what you're saying, you think maybe the continued improvement in group trends will kind of close that gap? Or is certainly be something else you're seeing? Or do you think it's just structurally lower going forward? Just kind of curious how you think that evolves over the next -- through the balance of the year and maybe just going forward?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. For us, it's been better than the industry. We're 3 or 4 percentage points off of depending on when you look at it off of peak occupancies. I think that you sort of noted some of the issues. I think part of it is happening because of the group. It's still -- our group is getting there, but it's still building. Part of it is -- and that's impacting a bunch of the cities, right, that have recovered a lot most of them. There are a couple of exceptions or one big exception, but most of the cities have recovered. But from an occupancy point of view, they're still off because they don't have the big citywide spec. So I do think it is partly the group. And then the other thing that's going on is, I sort of kid not to be a smartass about it, but part of it is in, right? So if you said to me, could we drive occupancy consistent with the prior peak. The answer is, yes, I could probably do it in the next couple of days, but it wouldn't be the right answer. Meaning, we are pushing hard on price because we've been obviously in a highly inflationary environment. And from the standpoint of trying to make our hotel owners the most money, that relative trade is the right trade, keep pushing price hard even though it might impact occupancy. The bottom line is better because the flow-through on rates a heck of a lot better than the flow-through on occupancy. So part of this is, yes, there's still goods coming back. You have business transient is still particularly the big corporates are only 92% back, part of -- and they'll come back no matter what they say, by the way, over the next few years, they'll come back. You heard it here. I'm telling you they'll come back. But a bigger part of it is, honestly, yield management strategies. I mean, we're really trying to push rate, and we don't want to give -- we're not as worried because it's a better outcome for every a better outcome for us, our owners make more money to drive higher margins.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Just a follow-up on that, Chris. Industry ADR growth has been tracking below inflation since April. Inflation is probably expected to ease further. And I know your pricing is based on supply and demand and you're pushing rate. And I'm trying to just reconcile those two forces as we look into the back half of this year, and maybe you could also just add in what your core SME or your core business transient ADR pricing growth is looking like and if that is in excess of inflation today.
Chris Nassetta: The answer is yes. I mean there is a tiny disconnect in timing. But I'd say the core pricing of our transient products, whether that's leisure or leisure transient or business transient is keeping up with inflation at its current levels. And obviously, we expect that to continue to come down. We feel good about the pricing power, again, with all the assumptions I already commented on about my view or the macro view that we've adopted for the back half of the year. And as we go into next year, and we think the broader environment is generally supportive for continued rate strength. I mean the one thing -- it's funny we talked -- I kid our team around here, it's like we've been living a little bit in bizarro world coming through COVID, obviously, and then in the aftermath, where you all be about fundamentals. That's all we would ever talk about on these calls. It all has ever talked about with investors, the fundamentals of demand, what's going on with demand and what's going on with supply. In the bizarro world, nobody talks -- nobody cares about supply. But we're now in a lie. I mean, everything is just getting reasonably close to a more normalized environment. prices are higher, okay, but that's just a broader reset that's happened throughout the entire economy, which I think unless you have broad disinflation, which it doesn't feel like that's happening anytime soon, that's sustained. And so you've sort of set a new water level, if you will, for pricing. And then eventually, in the very near term, it's going to get back to basic fundamentals, like what's going on with base demand and what's going on in supply. And I think the thing that doesn't get enough attention, like thankfully, as you can see in our starts and signings and NUG and our expectations for the future, we get a heck of a lot more than our fair share. But what's really going on in supply, particularly in the U.S. is anemic levels of industry growth that are sub if the 30-year average is 2.5%, it's running like 0.8% and it will be, and it's been running low. And given the environment, it's going to stay low. And so when you get to a more normalized environment, which is we're sort of morphing slowly into over the next year or two, you're going to find yourself in an environment where demand should be reasonably healthy if the economy is okay against a historically low supply side environment in the industry. And so, I think it's going to feel pretty good. And I think it's going to be another factor for sustaining performance and rate integrity.
Operator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Can you talk a little bit about the profile of your owners for new development and how that may be changing? With the signings activity you talked about in the second half of last year, first half of this year, any new trends or maybe some surprises you could speak to with respect to the organizations or the individuals that are investing in new development?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Duane, I'd say, look, no surprises really. I mean, I think Chris mentioned in his prepared remarks, I mean, I think half of the Spark owners are new to Hilton, right? And that's not a surprise to us when you're heading into a different segment you're heading into a different group of owners. And we view that as a positive thing, right? You're filling the top of the funnel with a lot more demand for the product going forward. You're diversifying your own base even further. I mean we've always had a really diversified owner base but we're diversifying it even further. And we're responding to -- if you think about -- Chris said before, when he answered David's question is like evolving the product base to respond to where the demand is, well, the owner base evolves in that same way, too, right? The capital follows the opportunities. And so, if we were living in a world not that long ago, where 70% to 80% of our deals every year were with existing owners, we're still doing the same absolute amount of volume with our existing owners. I have to assume, I don't have the stats in front of me, I have to assume we're doing more business with our existing owners, but then we're actually adding a whole lot more owners around the world. So, I think globally, we're down to like 50% or 60% of our deals are with existing owners annually. So, no surprises, but we view it as a huge net positive for the business.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. The other minor segment, I think that's well said, is on H3. I mentioned in my comments, it's a hybrid, and it's probably more apartment than hotel. We've been really excited about the institutional interest that we have from larger institutions that either want to develop or work with a partner and fund the development of large numbers of H3 just because of the cost to build the -- it's we think a 60% kind of margin business, and they really like the segment of demand and its existing profile and growth profile. So that's been not surprising because we -- when we were developing H3, that was our hope and expectation, but it's nice to see it come to life. I mean, as I said, we're negotiating 300 deals and that's not with 300 different people at this point. We barely opened it up. This is with a relatively limited number of very well-heeled more institutional type players. We will ultimately open the floodgates on H3 once we get it going. But it's been very nice to see.
Operator: The next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Obviously, great news on the RevPAR outlook, I did have a question circling back to the net unit growth. You mentioned Spark, and maybe it sounds like some timing in China that was a little bit pushed out. But when we think about the strong start numbers that you've talked about, can you help us think about timing of interest rates are still moving up a little bit here? And obviously, some of those big increases in starts are due to sort of comping the pandemics, so there's that going on, making the comps look different than normal. I guess just trying to think about the timing from here in terms of the factors like what has everything do you think bottomed. It seems like maybe not yet in terms of -- with interest rates still moving up, but help us think about the timing of like rates moving up, starts being high, but -- and kind of where you see things bottoming in terms of that.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Just for the record, in the signings numbers, then starts signings will be above prior high watermarks pretty materially, and starts will be about -- even though the comps are resi be about where we were at our prior high watermark. So, it's not just the benefit of comps. I'll let Kevin take the next part of it. But I mean, Spark, the beauty of Spark is it's a relatively low-cost entry product. And so, it doesn't really require a lot of financing.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Both Spark on H3 are more easily financeable products in this environment. So again, that's not why we launched those brands. We launched those brands because there's a ton of customer and owner and for the product. But if you think about the way it's playing out, it's sort of another example of diversification being a great thing. We have products that are more financeable. I think our lower-end products around the world are more financeable. And then I think I'd couple of things I'd guide you to as well. I think when you think about a tighter credit environment because not just rates, it's availability of capital, that's not a -- that's a Western world phenomenon. It's not just U.S., but it is highly concentrated in the U.S. Only 40% of our deliveries this year are going to be in the U.S., right? So it's a big world out there. We've got a lot of diversification. And I think that for all of the reasons we've given you, we think momentum can continue. And if you think about mean Chris talked about bizarro world on fundamentals. It's also bizarro world a little bit on development because it sort of starts with approvals you got to sign them, you got to get them in the ground and then they deliver, and that's all usually on a lag. And we've had COVID, and we've had a bunch of changes. But I think if you think about development being on a lag, it has to start somewhere. So, the outlook for approvals and starts bodes well for the future. The fact that we're rounding out the product base with more easily financeable products bodes well for the future, the fact that we have more limited service and lower-end products to deploy in emerging markets bodes well for the future. And it's not to say there won't be hiccups along the way, but we do believe that it's a progression back to normal, if you will, from here.
Operator: The next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Wanted to go back to the new credit card deal that Amex announced on Friday, you guys didn't mention it. So maybe hoping you could provide any commentary or incremental fees or economics that you expect to receive? And then maybe what's new or different in this deal versus what you last signed in 2017?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think, look, there's a fair amount of that is competitively sensitive, and we're not going to get into a lot of details, but I can sort of give you a sense for what's new and different. I think, look, the economics are a little bit better, which is as a result of the program just being better. I think our -- if you look at total spend in the program for this year, it's going to be about 2/3 higher than it was in 2019, right? So, we're growing the program massively. It's been a hugely successful partnership with American Express. We believe that those -- we've said -- we don't give you a lot of details on packet, and we apologize for that. But again, it's pretty sensitive competitively. It's been growing ahead of algorithm. We think it will continue to grow at or ahead of algorithm over time. It's a 10-year deal. I think a lot of people would have predicted the last time we did a credit card deal that credit cards were going to go somehow go away and be replaced by other forms of payments. I think it's quite the contrary. I think travel co-brand cards have become extremely successful and attractive products. They drive engagement across the system. It's not just about the economics on the card. And I think Amex feels the same way. So we're super excited about the deal and probably will stop short on too many more details than what we've already said.
Michael Bellisario: Got it. And then just one follow-up, any incremental economics included in the increased full year guidance from the credit card deal?
Kevin Jacobs: I mean we've been assuming that we've been working on this for a while. So I think there's nothing new on that front.
Operator: The next question comes from Chad Benyon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: I wanted to ask about the owned portfolio. The performance in the quarter recovered better than M&F fee portfolio, leading to some of the positive variance versus your Q2 midpoint EBITDA guide. Kevin, you noted, I think, strength in Europe and Japan, obviously, where you probably have some of the smaller concentration. But can you kind of help us think if the outlook has changed for this segment as we kind of look into the back half of the year, given how much improvement you saw in the second quarter, does that give you more confidence that you could see some margin improvement and just overall EBITDA growth year-over-year in the back half?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, no problem. Yes, there's a lot there. First of all, the whole portfolio is concentrated effectively in U.K., Ireland, Europe and Japan, so particularly Central Europe and Japan have been quite strong. There's no real sort of change in -- I mean, a little bit of year-over-year growth for subsidies last year. That's just a little bit of noise. I think basically, there's operating leverage in the business, right? Their own hotels, their leases, right? So there's even more operating leverage than a regular owned hotel. So they've been growing at a rate that is quite in excess of the overall fee business. As long as fundamentals stay growing, that will continue to be the case. And I think we -- our outlook for the segment is a little bit better now this quarter than it was last quarter because our outlook for Europe and Japan is better.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Just on the two new brands, [Arch] and H3. Are those going to be enough to get U.S. now back up to 5% that the international business will [indiscernible] recovery factor 6 to 7. And then maybe just related to that, by giving us some big numbers on where you think Spark can do in the near term. If I go back to when Motto was launched now 60 hotels, I think you're 8 to 10, when you launched Tempo, you talked about maybe 20 to 30 having got a Tempo yet, but one coming through, just maybe what's different here versus maybe where -- what those brands achieved in the shorter term?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Good question. I think the answer is yes on not just Spark and H3 in the U.S., but Home2 in the U.S., Hampton is growing in the U.S. I'll come back Tempo is just getting started. So I think the combination of all of those brands, the benefit of conversions in soft brands will get us back, I am confident to those levels. The difference between like a Tempo and Motto and Spark is night and day, honestly. I mean here's what happened at Tempo and Motto. We launched them about a day before the pandemic and they are all new build. I mean it's pretty much with both those brands. There are some adaptive reuse that will go on, but it is a vast majority of those -- our new builds. And so we got into COVID, there was no financing if everything slowed down. Those brands, I think, will do incredibly well. I think Tempo, we have I don't even have the pipeline number in my head. But as we open Times Square, we've got dozens of those under development around the country. We're getting ready to take the show on the road around the world and now that we're in -- even though the environment has some uncertainty in financing and all that, it's a heck of a lot better than it was in COVID. So, you'll start to see a great trajectory and Tempo, there's nothing wrong. Tempos are great, owners love it. It's just COVID got in the away. Basically saying same for Motto, Spark is a totally different thing. One, it's not -- we're not COVID. While there are challenges out there, it's 100%, 100% conversion brand. And it's basically taking hotels that are in much weaker brands and converting them into our system where there's huge opportunities for market share gains and it doesn't cost in terms of the quantum of money to do it, it's a relatively low ticket for owners to do it, thus, why we have so much interest. So I think the ramp on that will be much, much faster, and it's a very different thing. But I wouldn't diminish the opportunities in Motto and Tempo. They're going to -- particularly Tempo, Mottos, a micro hotel in just the biggest urban markets, we'll do a lot more of them. But I mean, Tempo will be a mega brand. It just got caught up in getting launched a minute before COVID.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I wouldn't connect -- is a shorter way of saying, I wouldn't connect too many dots. I mean the world is just different, and the brands, as Chris said, are different. And again, the beauty of Spark is you don't have to get a building built to do a Spark. It's all going to be buildings that are already built.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, MJ. Everybody, we appreciate as we always do, you spending a little bit of your morning with us. We know it's a busy time and lots of earnings releases. We obviously remain really optimistic. Obviously, Q2 was a great quarter for us. That's flowing through plus some given our expectations for the second half of the year. Again, we're optimistic on our unit growth and optimistic for not just the end of this year, but in the next year, we'll be able to deliver. But most importantly, the algorithm that we've described is alive and well and working and we continue to grow. We continue to maintain incredible cost discipline. The Company is at the highest margins by 800 basis points ever run at, thus producing the greatest amount of free cash flow in our history, and we intend to be super disciplined about how we allocate that otherwise known as giving it back to our shareholders. And so in any event, we'll look forward after Q3, giving you an update on how everything is going. I hope everybody has a great rest of the summer.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-04-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kucaj, Senior Director, Investor Relations. You may begin.
Brian Kucaj: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.  This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.  With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report that demand for travel remains strong, maintaining the trend that we saw in the back half of last year, which led to both our top and bottom line results finishing the quarter above the high end of our guidance. As we move forward, fundamentals remain strong, and we expect secular tailwinds to continue to support growth. Despite continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we're optimistic that the power of our network effect, our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and our fee-based capital-light business model will continue to drive strong operating performance, unit growth and meaningful cash flow, enabling us to return an increasing amount of capital to shareholders. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% year-over-year and 8% compared to 2019. Rate continued to drive growth, up 11% compared to 2019, and system-wide occupancy reached 68%, up from the prior quarter and just 2 points shy of peak levels. Globally, all segments outperformed expectations, and the lifting of COVID restrictions in China drove significant recovery in demand across Asia Pacific throughout the quarter. As a result, RevPAR in the month of March exceeded 2019 levels across all regions and segments for the first time since the pandemic began. Given our strong results and positive momentum, we're raising both top and bottom line guidance for the full year, which Kevin will cover in more detail in just a few minutes. Turning to the segment details. Leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter with RevPAR surpassing 2019 by approximately 15%, ahead of prior quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continue to drive rates up in the mid-teens above 2019 and occupancy fully recovered back to 2019 levels, driven by the surge in travel in Asia Pacific. Business transient also continued to improve with RevPAR up 4% from 2019, reflecting the resiliency of business travel, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, which remained roughly 85% of our segment mix. Recovery in group remains robust with RevPAR finishing roughly in line with 2019 with steady improvement each month in the quarter and March exceeding 2019 by 5%. Demand for future bookings also remained strong with full year group position up 28% year-over-year and 3% versus 2019. Additionally, new group leads ended in the quarter 13% higher than 2019, an increase of 6 points compared to prior quarter. Looking at the full year, based on the better-than-expected Q1 results, the accelerated demand across Asia and continued positive momentum in group, we now expect full year system-wide top line growth between 8% and 11% versus 2022, assuming some slowdown in the back half of the year due to macroeconomic uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. Turning to development. In the first quarter, we opened 64 properties totaling over 9,000 rooms, celebrating several milestones, including the opening of our 500th hotel in China, our 100th addition to the Tapestry Collection and the opening of the Canopy Toronto Yorkville, the Lifestyle brand's debut in Canada. We also opened 2 new Embassy Suite resort properties in Virginia Beach and Aruba with the Aruba addition marking the brand's 10th international property. And after recently being ranked the #1 Hotel Franchise in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 for a record-breaking 14th year in a row, Hampton by Hilton expanded its global presence to 37 countries with the brand's first property in Ecuador. While we expect to see some impact from the current financing environment, we are encouraged by the progress on the signings and starts front. We signed approximately 25,000 rooms during the quarter, growing our pipeline to a record 428,000 rooms, more than half of which are currently under construction. Signings in the quarter outpaced prior year across all regions. And conversion signings in the quarter were 24% higher than prior year, benefiting in part from the rollout of our newly-launched brand, Spark by Hilton. The initial interest in Spark has been tremendous. We currently have more than 300 deals in various stages of negotiation, and our teams are working hard to deliver this exciting new premium economy conversion brand with hotels opening later this year. Hilton Garden Inn also continues to be an engine of global growth with 14 new signings across 6 countries in the quarter and over 60 working deals in 22 countries. Additionally, in April, we announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Jaipur, marking the debut of the brand in India and further demonstrating our commitment to expanding our world-class luxury brands across the globe. Construction starts for the quarter totaled over 19,000 rooms, up nearly 20% from prior year, and starts in the U.S. were up more than 50% year-over-year. Our global under construction pipeline is up 8% compared to March 2022. And per STR, we continue to lead the industry in total rooms under construction. Taking all this into account, we still expect to deliver net unit growth within our guidance range this year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. On the loyalty front, Hilton Honors grew to more than 158 million members, a 19% increase year-over-year and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. In the quarter, Hilton Honors members accounted for 62% of occupancy, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, in an effort to further provide our loyal guests with an elevated wellness experience, in April, we announced the international expansion of our partnership with Peloton, bringing Peloton bikes to properties across the UK, Germany, Canada and Puerto Rico, building on our existing partnership to make Peloton bikes available in all U.S. hotels. As one of the world's largest hospitality companies, we recognize Hilton has the responsibility to protect the planet and to support the communities we serve to ensure our hotel destinations remain vibrant and resilient for generations of travelers to come. In early April, we published our 2022 Travel with Purpose Report, outlining our latest progress towards our 2030 environmental, social and governance goals, including our efforts to reduce our environmental impact while creating engines of opportunity within our communities and preserving the beautiful destinations where we live, work and travel. We remain committed to driving responsible travel and tourism globally while furthering positive environmental and social impact and sound governance across our operations and our communities. All of our success would not be possible without the dedicated efforts of our talented team, and we continue to be recognized for our remarkable workplace culture. Recently, Great Place to Work and Fortune ranked Hilton the #2 workplace in the U.S., our eighth consecutive year on the list, and once again, the top-ranked hospitality company, an accomplishment I'm truly proud of. Overall, despite macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that our world-class brands, dedicated team members and resilient business model have us incredibly well positioned for the future.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 30% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis and increased 8% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by strong demand in APAC as well as continued strength in leisure and steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $641 million in the first quarter, up 43% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth across all regions as well as strong performance in Europe and Japan benefiting our ownership portfolio. Management and franchise fees grew 30% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Continued good cost discipline further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.24, increasing 75% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 21% year-over-year with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR finished above 2019 peak levels for the second consecutive quarter, driven by strong rate growth. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 56% year-over-year and 35% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% compared to peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 68% year-over-year and was 13% higher than 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 32% year-over-year and 42% versus 2019, led by strong rate growth and group demand. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR was up 91% year-over-year and down only 4% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 5% compared to 2019, 32 points better than prior quarter as demand recovery accelerated due to the lifting of COVID restrictions. The rest of the Asia Pacific region also saw a significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 19% versus 2019, representing an 11-point improvement versus prior quarter. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially and now totals 428,000 rooms with nearly 60% located outside the U.S. and over half under construction. Looking at the full year, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we still expect net unit growth between 5% and 5.5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 10% and 12% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $770 million and $790 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.54 and $1.59. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth of between 8% and 11%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.875 billion and $2.95 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.68 and $5.88. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of 15% -- $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $41 million. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, and we expect to return between $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion for the full year. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question, please. Chad, can we have our first question?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli : Chris, just in terms of the way you guys are thinking about the year, your guidance, obviously, from a RevPAR perspective, up about 350 basis points at the midpoint. First quarter obviously contributes some of that lift. You guys spoke to a tougher macroeconomic situation in the second half of the year on your fourth quarter call. How much has your outlook on the second half changed as obviously, you get some contribution from the first quarter, you have a lot of visibility in the second quarter? Just trying to understand within the context of that guidance, if you've had any kind of change or pushing out of when you guys believe or when you're interpreting the macroeconomic conditions will toughen.
Christopher Nassetta : Yes, a really good question. Obviously, I think I used the macroeconomic uncertainty two or three times for a reason because there is an uncertain environment. I mean, what we're seeing today is, as you heard in what you saw in our numbers and in the prepared comments is very good strength across all our segments. Leisure continues to be super strong. Business transient in the quarter, both demand and pricing, has returned to prior peak levels and group is motoring on its way. It's just longer in gestation to get there. But based on the trends, it's going to get there in the second half of the year, I think, with a great deal of certainty. So we are not -- you didn't really ask it this way, but I think part of it is we're not seeing any cracks in terms of demand patterns. There is a lot of momentum. I sit at this very table every Monday morning with my entire executive committee, representing every region of the world. And the first question I ask, are you seeing any cracks? Any issues with demand broadly? Any issues regionally? Any issues from a segment point of view? And the truth is we're just not seeing it. Having said that, we know here in the U.S. and in many other places around the world, there's an inflation issue. Now it's being -- it is being managed. It's becoming -- it is in the process of normalizing, particularly here in the U.S., but it's not there. And the Fed has said it's going to deal with it. I believe that -- I take them at their word. And I think ultimately, that means you're going to continue to have a slowing of the broader economic environment that, at some point, has to have some impact on us. It hasn't yet for a bunch of reasons, I suggested: one, I still think we have a lot of pent-up demand; two, we are still benefiting from a secular shift in spending patterns broadly. So while people may have a little less to spend, they're spending more of it on experiences and a lot less of it on things. You see that throughout the economy. And international travel is finally, with China opening up, while it's not back anywhere near where it has been, international travel is really on a steep up-slope. And all of those things are keeping the momentum in demand in the business. Recognizing also, by the way, that capacity additions are at historical lows and are probably going to stay there for a while. So when I said very quickly in my comments, fundamentals remain strong, I mean, fundamentals are supply and demand. Demand is good for the reasons I suggest that supply in the industry is anemic. Thankfully, we get a lot more than our fair share of the supply, so that's good for us. But the basic fundamentals in the business are good. Having said all of that, we do expect things will slow down. You asked a question which I'm actually going to answer, which is, do I feel any differently than I did sitting here a quarter ago. And I would say, yes, I would say number one, the economy appears to be more resilient. Inflation is being tamed. I have a higher degree of confidence at this point. I'm not the right person to ask, but well, I'll tell you what I think. I have a higher degree of confidence that the Fed will land the plane reasonably well and that we're not going to have a deep dark kind of recession. We're going to have a slowdown, maybe a recession. It feels a lot more like it will be reasonably modest at this point. So I feel better about that. And I definitely feel like things have been pushed out a little bit. One, just time has gone by. We have now a quarter under our belt. We're deep into understanding half of the year. I mean, we're not done. There's a bunch of the second quarter left, but we have pretty good sight lines at this point into Q2. And that feels like the momentum is continuing. So you get a half a year sort of under your belt. It gives you more confidence. And so I feel better about, thus why we increased our guidance on the top line and bottom line because I feel like there's enough momentum in our business. The economy broadly is pretty resilient. There's more confidence in the Fed being able to sort of do this without wreaking too much havoc. So I'd say net-net, yes, I feel a bit better. Having said that, we did and I said it intentionally in the prepared comments, we do assume because we are sentient and we know what's going on, that at some point, you will see some slowing. I think realistically, it's more late third quarter and into the fourth quarter. I honestly think there's a chance it kicks into next year, given the broader momentum and the strength of the consumer broadly. But I don't know. And so what we've tried to do in our guidance is, build in an expectation that this -- these efforts of the Fed here and in other parts of the world will eventually work and that we're going to see some, at least, modest slowdown. And so that's sort of what -- we feel better than we did. We still think there's a lot of uncertainty, and we've tried to factor for that in our guidance in the second half of the year.
Carlo Santarelli : Great. Thank you, Chris. And then if I could, just one quick follow-up. In the period, obviously, I think managed franchise RevPAR was 29%. Unit growth on the franchise side was 4.4. The fees -- franchise fees grew about 23%. I'm assuming that, that's a comp issue with some ancillary non-RevPAR fees in the 1Q of '22?
Christopher Nassetta : Correct. Yes. I mean, the way to think about those is those are normalizing in growth rates, above algorithm growth, above typical growth you would assume sort of on a same-store basis. But we're still particularly because of Omicron, on the fee side, we have a supercharged fee growth rate in the first quarter. But I think the way to think about, over the intermediate, even longer term, is we think all of those ancillary license fees and otherwise, they're going to grow better than our typical algorithm growth. You're just -- yes, you have some year-over-year normalization going on in Omicron impact.
Kevin Jacobs : And a little bit of mix as well, so the franchise business is a little more concentrated in the U.S. where RevPAR growth has not been as robust as outside the U.S.
Operator: And the next question is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.
Joseph Greff : Chris, I'd love to hear your views on and your understanding of what developers are feeling right now, just given changes in the credit markets and the banking environment, particularly with maybe limited service developers that are more reliant on regional bank for financing. Are they requesting more capital help from you guys? Do you think maybe they're pulling forward some deals maybe in an effort to circumvent future tightening? Can you talk about what your expectation is for maybe pipeline growth for the balance of the year? And then I have a follow-up.
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. I mean, it's early. So we've obviously been talking to a lot of our ownership community as the banking issues have sort of taken hold. And I would say there's a broad range that anecdotally go from, we haven't seen much impact. We're still getting finance. As you can see in our numbers in starts in the U.S. being so far up. Now part of that was before the banking, the regional local banking set of issues, but part of it was after. They're still getting the best owners with the best relationships are getting their deals done, and our market share in a tougher environment goes up. So proportionately relative to others in the industry, we typically do even better. But we also have folks that are saying very hard to find the money and some in the middle that are saying like they're talking to their banks and their banks are saying, "Hey, we're going to be there for you. Just give me like 90 days. Let me see how this all plays out." And so I think it's early to know. I think being objective about it, which I always am trying to be, I think the Fed seems to be managing through this reasonably well. There's some ongoing things today or this week going on, but I think the Fed, I think, is pretty committed to making sure there isn't sort of a run on regional banks broadly. So I think we're in reasonably good shape that way. But I think that the net result is for a period of time, there'll be less credit available, okay? I still think we'll get more than our fair share of it because our brands are better performing, and we'll see our share go up as we historically do when times get tougher for financing, et cetera. But it's hard to believe that in the short to intermediate term, there's not going to be some impact. It hasn't shown up. It didn't show up in the first quarter. We haven't seen it yet, but I think in terms of pipeline, people, I think our expectation at this point for the year is the pipeline is going to keep growing. The bigger question is going to be the conversion under construction. In the first quarter, it was very, very good, as you heard, in the data. I think that will get more challenging. I think it just stands to reason that will get more challenging. And so listen, the good news for us is we tend to get -- our share goes up. It's a big world. While China has been a little bit slower to sort of pick up steam on the development side, it is picking up steam, I think, particularly as we think about next year, I think it's going to be a big net contributor. And conversions are -- have been and continue to be a big focus of ours. We think we'll do meaningfully more as a percentage of overall delivery this year as conversion somewhat aided by this year a little bit, but a lot, I think, next year by Spark, which is 100% conversion, very low cost of entry in a relative very, very lightly, if dependent at all, on the banking community. So that's not why we did Spark. We did Spark for all the right reasons, to better serve, create a bigger and better network effect, but just in time management, the timing of it actually is quite good. As we said, it's not going to do a lot for this year, but I think over -- starting next year and beyond, it will add significantly. But the net of all that, Joe, is, again, answering -- I'm trying to give a little bit of color across the board. We do expect that what's going on in the banking system, particularly for limited service, which is disproportionately financed by the regional and local banks, that they're going to pull in their horns. They're going to survive. Most of them are going to get through this, but there's going to be less credit available, and that's going to slow things down a bit.
Joseph Greff : Great. Thank you for that, Chris. And just my follow-up question is this, the system-wide RevPAR is flat, which is sort of what's baked into the second half guidance. But if we just think about it for the intermediate term, not that you're guiding to anything beyond the second half, do you think fee growth can be in excess of RevPAR growth, just given the rooms growth in the last few years?
Christopher Nassetta : Should be, yes. It should be mathematically, yes. The algorithm is, as you know, so the same-store plus unit growth. And we've been delivering on average even through COVID, 5-ish, maybe a tick over, even in an environment that is being impacted by some of the things I just described. We believe we'll continue to do that as we manage our way over the next couple of years back up to the 6% to 7%. And so even in a no growth same-store environment, which is not certainly what we're experiencing now for the record, as you can see, but even in that environment, fees would continue to grow with unit growth.
Operator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley : Chris, I kind of wanted to stick with the development activity, but maybe let's just go out a little bit longer term. And if you could help us pull from a little bit of your experience of how this played out during the global financial crisis a little bit. Just help us think about, if we think about some of the -- there's kind of three drivers, I think, about domestic unit growth, obviously, decently reliant on the financial system; the conversion activity, where you've got a pretty interesting pipeline of brands that might even be stronger than back then; and then the international side. Can you help us think about sort of buckets 2 and 3? And as we get on to '24 and '25, how much could those help carry the weight? And how protected do you think, let's call it, a broad mid-single-digit net unit growth target should be in a variety of different scenarios as people are just trying to think about broader fallout here from financing and again, a more difficult macro broadly?
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. I mean, that's the right question to ask. And that's why I said, yes, we do expect to see some impact. But I also said, maybe I backed into it but I'll say it more directly, we feel good about being in that range you described. We've been around 5 through the toughest down cycle in recorded history. Through COVID, we've stayed sort of 5-ish or a tick above. And we think over the next period of time, as these things sort of work their way through the system, that we'll be able to say there. How are we going to do it? Well, one, we're going to gain share because our products perform better, and we have the highest market share brands in the business. We're going to keep pushing market share higher. And so while there's going to be potentially less new build activity domestically, we will plan to work hard to get an even larger share of that. Conversions, we do believe that we're uniquely suited certainly relative to The Great Recession by having not only more shots on goal in terms of brands. But Spark, again, there's -- long term, we think Spark is probably the most disruptive thing that we'll have ever done in terms of giving customers, at that price point, a really good product. But it's also, the timing of it is convenient and helpful because it depends very little on financing. Most of the other conversions still depend on financing. A lot of conversions, not all, but a lot of conversions do happen around asset transactions where people say I'm a buyer and a seller and I'm going to change brands and upgrade properties. We'll still convert a bunch of other types of properties that -- where they're not changing ownership, but no change -- lower change of ownership puts a little pressure on that. But Spark is I guess that we'll keep giving in the sense of unit growth because, again, you're talking about 20,000 rooms. You're talking about a $2 million sort of bogey for somebody to convert and get into our system versus even at the lowest price point, newbuilds that require financing and/or writing checks of $10 million, $15 million or, in most cases, much higher than that. So conversions will play a big part in it. And as I already said, it's a big world. So what's going on here in the U.S. is with the banking system is unlike The Great Recession where the whole financial system around the world was sort of imperiled in free fall, this really at the moment is more of a U.S. thing, obviously touched Europe a little bit and Switzerland, but it has largely been sort of continued to be a U.S. thing. And so you have the opportunities around the whole rest of the world. Notably, as I said, China, in the sense that China is probably taking a quarter or two more. So I think China won't contribute what I would have hoped it would this year, but I think it will be made up for next in '24 and '25 because the engines are really cranking up. It's just a process. So it will be conversions, international growth and increased market share of what does get done in the U.S. The other thing that is going on is we launched Spark. We're getting ready, and I'll maybe tickle the ivories a little bit. We're getting ready to launch another brand sort of at the -- in the extended-stay space at the lower end, mid-scale, very low end of mid-scale, below home to that we have -- we've been working with our ownership community and customers on that while it will be a newbuild product, it will be a very efficient build cost. So again, the things -- my history of this living through The Great Recession, all that is your lower cost to build products that have -- that are very high margin because people make the most money doing it and they're the lowest risk and they're the easiest financed. Those are the ones that get going the fastest. And so again, we didn't develop this brand that we're getting ready to launch, hopefully, in the next 30 or 60 days because of this. We launched because customers want it, owners want to build it. But again, it won't have any effect this year but starting probably the latter part of '24, more likely '25 as people look at a brand that can deliver just astronomical margins on a very efficient per unit build cost, we think it will build a lot of excitement. Home2 has been off the hooks in demand throughout all of COVID and otherwise because people make -- such customers love it, it's very high margin. We think customers are going to love this. It's something different. It's at a lower price point. But the margins are much even higher than that. And so again, it will take time to gestate that, but we think that is a mega brand opportunity for us that as we think about more likely '25, '26, even in an environment that's been more challenging -- is more challenging from a financing point of view, as the financing markets come back and they always do, it's those products that really get done fastest. And so we feel good about being around 5 and headed back to 6 to 7 over the next couple of years, and it will be a combo platter of all of those things that you said and that I just spoke to.
Operator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Smedes Rose : I just wanted to ask you quickly on that extended-stay launch. We've seen a lot of products from different brands being launched to the extended-stay segment. And I was just curious, what do you think is driving so much interest from customers? And are they abandoning another segment of mid-scale? We don't get data or at least in our case, we don't get extended-stay data specifically. We just see the chain scale data. I'm just wondering what sort of shifts you're seeing within that, that it's leading so many people to launch into that sector.
Christopher Nassetta : We were already seeing it pre-COVID, where there was just a demand for workforce housing and people -- more mobility in their lives and they wanted to be places and work from different places. And they didn't -- they were going to be there long enough to commit. They're like, get an apartment and pay a one year's deposit and all that fun stuff. And so we are already seeing demand that was outstripping supply. And then COVID hit. And while a lot of things have normalized, and I've talked about this on prior calls a bunch of times, the one thing that happened is it accelerated the idea of mobility. While the office environment is normalizing, a lot of people are going back. It's not exactly what it was. More people are going to be remote as a percentage of the workforce permanently. More are going to have flexibility and sort of different times of year, times of the week, Mondays and Fridays. And all of that is continuing to just -- as those patterns shift, it's building more and more demand against a limited amount of supply. And so the fundamentals we think are just great. The way I think about the product that we're developing, and I'm getting ahead of myself, but it's coming really soon. I mean, down we have -- we've built it. We've done 99% of the work. It's almost a hybrid. It's like an apartment efficiency meets hotel. And I'd say it's almost like 60-40. It's more apartment efficiency. There's so many workforce housing needs that are just unmet with this kind of product for somebody who needs to be somewhere 30, 60, 90, 120 days. So you're talking about average length of stay of probably 20 to 30 days on average versus most of the core extended-stay brands are like 5 to 10 maybe, somewhere in that range, if you look at the industry. So it's a different demand base, different types of locations, which is why we love it because we're not serving it, meaning it's not competitive with what we're doing with Home2 and certainly not competitive with Homewood because it's serving a totally different need, mostly in totally different markets. And as I said, we -- I didn't intend to go this far, sorry. But this is hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hotels over time. This is not like we're going to do 50 or 100 of these. I mean, you'll wake up over time in 10 years, and will -- it will be like Home2. We'll have 4, 5, 6. We'll have a lot of these because we think the need is there now and growing. And we -- while a lot of people are doing things in this arena, I think we've proven by launching brands that we do uniquely have done it pretty well to launch brands and get to scale and build network effect, not just broadly for the company but within brands. And we've done that, I think, as well or better than anybody. And I think we have an opportunity to do it here. And our system delivers. The system delivers the highest market share in the business. So if you're an owner thinking about I'm going to build a similar product somewhere else, I mean, you're going to look at the system strength. And ultimately, I think, historically, people vote with their feet. They vote with a product that they think will work better from a customer point of view, ultimately, higher margins and drive higher share. And so we got to do it again, but we've got a pretty good track record of doing this stuff. We've spent a lot of time on this. And hopefully, by the next time we talk, it will be out of the shoot and we'll be talking about how many deals we got lined up.
Smedes Rose : And can I just ask you a quick other question? The difference between the gross room additions in the first quarter and then that room just seemed kind of wider than what we've seen. Is that -- was that just -- is that sort of a seasonal thing or was there something in particular on the deletion side that you can call out or...
Kevin Jacobs : Are you talking about the difference between -- if you do Q1 in the guidance, Smedes?
Smedes Rose : Well, just the first quarter gross room additions and then the net room additions that seem just pickup...
Kevin Jacobs : No, there's -- no. Removals is right in line with normal. We'll end up about 1%, 1% and change for the year. Just the gross rooms from a timing perspective -- I mean, I think I don't want to repeat what Chris said earlier on the call. But I think from a timing perspective, for the full year, gross room additions were lower in the first quarter and deletions were about the same. So that's the difference.
Operator: And the next question is from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley.
Stephen Grambling : Maybe following up on some of your comments about the new brand launches, Spark and then it sounds like another one in the extended-stay. When you think about going into some of these lower-end chain scales, I think many of the peers often see higher attrition rates or deletion rates. What can you do to ensure that the attrition rates from your brands are more resilient long term? And have you seen any evidence of that from your current lower of chain scale brands such as Tru?
Christopher Nassetta : No. You mean, attrition meaning losing hotels out of the system? No, I mean, here's the -- listen, and not to be too simplistic about it. But what we do is really made much easier by delivering commercial performance. So having great brands that resonate with customers, loyalty that connects the dots, that customers are engaged with, product and service in those particular brands that really resonates with customers. And ultimately, our commercial engines and commercial strategies that deliver the highest level of market share. And so if you look at our -- if you look at like Tru or Hampton almost -- I would say, almost 100%, I don't know, 90% to 100% of the deals that exit the system within those brands. And I don't think any Trus have exited the system that I'm aware of. It's a relatively new brand. I'm probably -- probably none. But Hampton is by our choice, meaning that their time is up. They're in a location or they're in a physical state that we just don't think works anymore. And so that's by our choice. We have very little attrition. And back to where I started, the reason we have very little attrition is our mega category brands are category killers. They drive incredibly high share. So as we think about Spark, as we think about our new extended-stay brand, we have to get it right, which we will. We have to drive really high share, which we will. The product has to really work for customers, which is what drives that. And people don't want to leave, right? So our history is super, super good in the mega categories. If you go through the whole list of all our extended, Home2, Homewood, Hampton, Tru, the attrition there is almost all. The vast, vast majority of it is by our choice.
Stephen Grambling : That's helpful context, and that's my one question.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz : I wanted to just go back to Spark because obviously, a lot of enthusiasm and success and it's unlike things that you've done before. If we look at the makeup of the deals that you've put together, I'd love some color on what's in there. Are those independents that are looking for a brand? Are those switching from other brands for one reason or another? Are any of the hotels switching within your system into it that may have otherwise departed for one reason or another?
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. Of the 300 -- I'll get this direction. Of the 300 bang around it, I would say it's almost all. It's very little of us. So there are a few Hamptons of the 300. So a teeny number of Hamptons that we would probably otherwise say will exit the system that we think for Spark will work even though they wouldn't work for Hampton. But that's a teeny tiny amount. The rest of it is almost -- there's a little bit of independent on that data point, but it's almost all coming from other brands in that -- in the economy space and spread around what you would guess. And I have some of that data but I'm not sharing it.
David Katz : Fair enough and understood. My follow-up is when we look at the revenue intensity of adding in this category, how does that measure up with your other brands? Obviously, the upper upscale, a unit is generating more, right? But how does the fee structure and the revenue intensity of this measure up and add to your system?
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. The fee structure is quite similar to other fee structures. They are smaller and it is at a lower rate. We think the rate here is probably $80 to $90 versus the net Tru, which is $120 -- in the $120s with Hampton being at like $140. So it's -- they're a similar size so a lot of the Trus and Hamptons, they're at a lower ADR by design. And so yes, per pound fees will be a little bit less and certainly versus upper upscale business. You have to remember in our world is we're trying to create a network effect. So this is a massive customer acquisition tool for us. There's 70 million or 80 million people traveling in this segment, half of whom are younger people that travel and this is all they can afford. And while we serve some of them, we're not serving many of them. So the opportunity is for us to get them hooked on our system early by giving them the best product that they can find in the economy space because every single hotel, every customer-facing element of the hotel has to be done or it doesn't get our name. And we regulate the gate. Nobody comes in. Nobody passes through the gate until that's done. And so the other thing to remember is it's an infinite yield. So we built -- we bring in tens of millions of new customers that are going to trade up. They're going to grow up and they're going to use our other products. They're going to trade in and around our products. And we built this brand with a lot of hard work and elbow grease from the standpoint of the deals that we're getting. While they may be per pound a little lighter, we're not paying for them. I mean, thus the infinite yield. There's no investment. We continue to build these incremental fee streams. And when you add up what the potential, I mean, I suspect 30 years ago, somebody said that about Hampton. Well, I mean, Hampton at that time was a $50 rate, and it's 100, 120-room hotel. How much money can that make you? Well, Hampton is a value well into the billions of dollars because turns out when you do a few thousand of them, it adds up. And the ultimate potential of Spark is bigger than Hampton because it's a bigger slice of the pie. So we're very excited about it. We think it is going to add not just new unit growth, but it's going to add significantly to earnings as it ramps up and ultimately to the overall value of the company.
David Katz : Sounds like no meaningful key money there either?
Christopher Nassetta : No.
Kevin Jacobs : Yes, I think David, just to add just a little bit, and Chris covered it, yes. I mean, the capital intensity of our -- in our business is much higher at the upper end, right? So the higher you go in the chain scale, the more the deals are competitive and you're contributing capital. And the other thing I'd say is why I think sort of working with you for a while, I think where you were headed with that. I think from a revenue intensity perspective, Chris described it. As you layer in these lower fee per room hotels, mathematically, of course, your fee per room does go down. But when we model it out over a long period of time, you'd be surprised the fees per room do not...
Christopher Nassetta : Keep going up.
Kevin Jacobs : They keep going up over time, and we continue to grow at what we often talk about as algorithm. So if you take same-store sales plus NUG, the fees per room and the fee growth continues at that pace. And part of that is because of the non-RevPAR-driven fees that Chris mentioned earlier in the call, which we think will continue to grow at a higher rate than algorithm. So you put that all in your model and it's -- it's surprisingly steady/continues to grow. 
Christopher Nassetta : There is no year where fees per room are going down just because the arithmetic. And we continue to have RevPAR growth on the existing pool of assets that continues to go up. And yes, fees per room as we model it 5, 10 years out, just keep going up.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin Farley : I wanted to ask a little bit about the business transient performance in the quarter. I know you talked about RevPAR being ahead of 2019 levels. But I wonder if you could give us a sense of where either occupancy or number of business transient nights in the quarter compared to Q1 of '19. It seemed like from kind of broader industry trends, that Q4 didn't show that much sequential improvement from Q3 in terms of that change versus 2019. And maybe you'll say, of course, it may not matter at all when you have RevPAR performance as strong as what you have. So I'm certainly not saying it's not a strong quarter, but I'm kind of curious what's going on with that business transient night piece event.
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. On a global basis, business transient, actually fourth quarter to first quarter ticked up. So on a -- it was about -- in the fourth quarter, about 1.03 and it went to 1.04. But importantly, on an aggregate occupancy basis in the first quarter, for the first time, it actually got back or slightly above where it was at the prior peak. Now that's not a U.S., that's a global number. So why is that happening in the face of everything you're reading? And it's really simple, which is why I said it in the comments, it's SME. It's like what we're all filtering through is big corporate America. Big corporate America is worried about the world, all the uncertainty and maybe curbing some of their appetite for travel. Having said that, I've met with -- we had a big customer event, and I didn't get that impression even at a big corporate America. I think incrementally year-over-year, they're all traveling more but maybe not as much as they would have thought. But the SMEs continue, which are 85% of our business, continue to perform really, really well. And the big corporates weren't really back in any event. And so since they had not come back to prior levels, while they may recover more slowly, they're not, my impression from talking to a bunch of them, they're not really cutting because they already had cut so much and they hadn't built it back. They're just -- maybe it's flattening for them. But I said it many times over the last few years. We have, by choice, we were always quite dependent 80% of our business was SMEs. It's 85% now by choice, meaning we have shifted our mix because it's higher rated business, it's more resilient in the sense that it's more fragmented by the very nature of what it is. So business transient is alive and well. And I'd say in the first quarter, both the price was above and volume was at or slightly above, and that trend continues into Q2 although we're early in Q2.
Robin Farley : Okay, great. Very helpful. And then just the other question, kind of a small one is your distribution through OTAs, I have to imagine that as business transient is coming back, that your OTA distribution is moving down compared to last year, just given that leisure is not as big a percent of total.
Christopher Nassetta : It's normalizing. It's slightly elevated relative to pre-COVID but not much and has come down a bunch. And we expect probably by the end of the year, certainly into next, it will be normalized with where it was, which is where we want it to be.
Operator: The next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays.
Brandt Montour : I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit to the drivers of the conversion activity, taking Spark out of it. Chris, you mentioned potentially lower hotel transaction activity from financing headwinds putting pressure as well as financing being a headwind in and of itself for doing non-Spark hire and conversions. I guess could you stack that up against some of the maybe positive tailwinds, perhaps enforcement of brand standards across the industry, foresee more trade down or even more independents getting more nervous looking for brands? How do you look at all those factors on a net basis later into the year?
Kevin Jacobs : Yes, I'll take this one, Brandt. I think outside of Spark as we've covered that, I think you've got a couple of factors. One is yes, in sort of an environment where people are expecting demand to soften, they tend to seek out brands more often, and obviously, they tend to seek out the stronger brand. So it's being driven by somewhat of demand for independent hotels converting to brands. And then I think the other factor is in an environment where credit's tighter, a cash-flowing hotel, right, so acquiring a hotel and that's already cash-flowing, it's easier to finance than new construction. So I think those are the two primary drivers. And then you think about some of the things that are going on around the world. But they're generally driven by transactions and generally in a softening demand environment, easier to finance and more demand for the branded systems.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.
Bill Crow : As we think about the change to your guidance for 2023, how much of that is driven by areas outside the U.S.? And has there really been any change or any positive change to U.S. expectations?
Kevin Jacobs : Yes. I think, Bill, what you're seeing is it's kind of -- it's across the board. It's positive change to all regions. Largely, I think Chris covered this earlier in the call, largely concentrated with the demand strength continuing into the second quarter and us taking the second quarter up a little bit, a little bit in the third quarter and then the -- and if you think about pushing out the anticipated slowdown in the back half of the year, but there is improvement in the outlook in all regions, including the U.S.
Bill Crow : A follow-up. I'm going to actually switch my follow-up, and I want to actually address something you just said, Chris, which is that large corporates seem to be flat in their demand. And I'm just curious whether this early in the recovery, and I know there are issues going on in tech and financial services in particular, but does this give credence to that argument that business travel never fully recovers?
Christopher Nassetta : I mean, I don't think so. Well, the #1 prima facie evidence it has. So I mean, Bill, but I just finished on a couple of questions ago, in the data in the first quarter, business travel has already recovered. I think what it means for us is in the intermediate term, as you get more certainty in the environment, there's upside in business travel, meaning we've done a good job of shifting to SMEs. With that shift, we're sort of, on a volume basis, back to where we were. Rate base is higher. The big corporates still have to travel. By the way, the big corporates are also not one size fits all. It's really where you see the impact is technology, banking consulting. If you look at a lot of the other big corporate sectors, they're still growing, but those sectors weighed it down. As those sectors stabilize and start to think about the future and being competitive and getting their sales forces back out and get out of cost-cutting mode, which they will, they always do, I look at it as upside. So I think when you wake up in a year or two and we're in a little -- we're in -- whenever we get to a more certain environment, hopefully it's sooner than later, I think the opportunity will be that business travel, both volume and price, will be higher than the prior peak. I think the same thing for the group business. I think this has done -- what's happened in the last three years has done nothing but reinforced -- I mean, we're definitely benefiting from a lot of pent-up demand, but it's done nothing but reinforce, as I talk to all of our group customers and the like, that the need for people to be congregating to do the things that they do in culture and collaboration and innovation and all of those fun things. So I kind of famously said when we get through this in like April, May of 2020, I think it will look a lot more like it did than it does. And I think that's -- I still think that. And I think the data largely supports it. If you look at the business mix, like this quarter versus pre COVID and the big segments of business transient, leisure transient and group, we're within a point. I mean, right now, the only difference is leisure is a point higher then group's a point lower. Otherwise, it's about where it was, right? And that's because group takes time to sort of -- to come back. And in the meantime, leisure has been strong. But ultimately, as we get strong high-rated groups back, we will continue to mix more of that in. So I do not personally believe there is credence to that argument. I think the data supports that argument at this moment.
Bill Crow : Look forward to seeing you early next month.
Christopher Nassetta : Yes. Same.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta : Thank you, Chad. Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Interesting times with all -- the word of the day is uncertainty. But as you can see, we feel very good about what we delivered in the first quarter. We feel great about the second quarter. Frankly, we feel pretty good about the full year. We're making sure that we're keeping our eyes wide open about what's going on in the world. But we continue to do well and deliver, and most importantly, return more and more capital, which we'll continue to do. So thank you for the time, and we look forward to catching up with you after the quarter.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2023-02-09 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery Chapman, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery Chapman: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K and first quarter 2022 10-Q. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the Company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their results, we’ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We’re happy to report a strong end of another year of continued growth. Together with our team members, owners and communities, we’ve navigated through the most challenging times our industry has experienced and are deep into recovery throughout the world. During the year, we continued investing in new innovations and partnerships that meet guests’ evolving needs and further strengthen our value proposition for Hilton Honors members and owners. We remain committed to delivering reliable and friendly experiences to our guests and we continue to enhance our network through our strategic and disciplined approach to development, enabling us to serve even more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion they may have. Our strategy drove strong performance for the year with system-wide RevPAR up 42.5% versus 2021 and approximately 1% shy of 2019 levels. Both adjusted EBITDA and EPS surpassed our expectations and prior peaks with margins of roughly 69%, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and more than 800 basis points over 2019 levels. Strong results and higher margins enabled us to generate the highest levels of free cash flow in our history and returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders for the full year. Turning to results for the quarter. System-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% year-over-year and increased 7.5% compared to 2019 with performance improving sequentially versus the third quarter. We saw continued progression across all segments with leisure, business transient and group RevPAR all exceeding 2019 levels. System-wide occupancy reached 67%, up from the third quarter and just 3 points shy of prior peak levels. Overall rates remained robust, increasing 13% versus 2019 with all segments exceeding expectations. As expected, leisure trends remained strong throughout the quarter, with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels by approximately 12%, modestly ahead of third quarter performance. Strong leisure transient demand continued to drive rates up in the high-teens compared to 2019. Business transient RevPAR also continued to improve, with business travel up 3% versus 2019, nearly all industries saw continued recovery compared to the prior quarter. Small and medium-sized businesses remained an important and growing part of our business travel segment, accounting for roughly 85% of our segment mix and enhancing our overall resiliency. Group saw the biggest quarter-over-quarter improvement with RevPAR fully recovering to 2019 levels, driven by both occupancy and ADR gains. Company meetings boosted performance improving more than 7 points versus the third quarter. As we look to the year ahead, acknowledging macroeconomic uncertainty we expect system-wide top line growth of 4% to 8% versus 2022. We expect performance to be driven by continued growth in all segments and aided by easy first quarter comps due to Omicron, meaningful recovery across Asia and solid growth in U.S. urban markets as group business continues to recover. Comprising roughly 20% of our normalized mix, group is a segment with the greatest visibility. For 2023, group position is up 25% year-over-year and nearly back to 2019 levels. Even with robust forward bookings, the pipeline still remains strong with tentative bookings up more than 20% versus last year, helped by rising demand for company meetings as organizations bring their teams back together. Additionally, pricing for new bookings is up in the low double digits and lead volumes in January were at all-time highs. Turning to the development side. We continue to deliver on our commitment to capital-light growth. For the full year, we added nearly a hotel a day, totaling more than 58,000 rooms and celebrated the opening of our 7,000th hotel. Since our go-private transaction 15 years ago, we’ve more than doubled the size of our system. Our rooms in the U.S. are up nearly 100%, and our international portfolio is now 3.5 times larger. Additionally, we’ve added 10 new brands to our system, more than doubling our portfolio of brands. We achieved all of this without any acquisitions and more than 90% of the deals in our current pipeline did not have any key money or other financial support. In the fourth quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 60,000th Home2 Suites room, our 150,000th DoubleTree room, our 200th hotel in CALA and 600th hotel in Asia Pacific, including our first Hilton Garden Inn in Japan. We also saw continued strength in construction starts throughout the year, leading to starts of more than 70,000 rooms for the full year. In the U.S., starts increased more than 9% versus 2021. We now have more rooms under construction than all major competitors. With a record pipeline of more than 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction, we expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5% for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to 6% to 7% net unit growth over the next couple of years. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect and enables us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. Building on this commitment, last month, we launched our newest brand, Spark by Hilton, a value-driven product that delivers our signature reliable and friendly service at an accessible price. Spark provides a simple, consistent and comfortable stay with practical amenities and unexpected touches, filling an open space in the industry by creating a new premium economy lodging option to meet the needs of even more guests and owners. Premium economy represents a large and growing segment of travelers, totaling nearly 70 million annually in the U.S. alone, for which, we have not had a tailored brand to serve. This cost-effective all conversion brand offers a streamlined reinvestment plan, focused on core guest elements and enables owners to leverage our industry-leading commercial engines and powerful network effect. To date, we have more than 200 deals in various stages of negotiation, almost all of which are conversions from third parties. Additionally, we’ve identified more than 100 U.S. markets with no Hilton-branded products, providing a great opportunity for the brand and the Company to expand its presence. As a testament to the strength of our system and our continued success of our customer-focused strategy, Hilton Honors surpassed 150 million members during the fourth quarter and remains the fastest-growing hotel loyalty program. Honors members accounted for approximately 64% of occupancy in the quarter, up more than 300 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. Additionally, we welcomed approximately 200 million guests to our properties during the year, exceeding pre-pandemic peak levels. We remain focused on ensuring Hilton has a positive impact on the communities we serve. For the sixth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. And for the seventh consecutive year, we were ranked among the World’s Best Places to Work by Fortune and Great Place to Work. As our performance demonstrates, our team members have proven that we can handle whatever comes our way. And because of our hard work and discipline, we are incredibly well positioned for the future. We’re at a pivotal moment with great opportunities ahead and a new golden age of travel. And we’re more confident than ever that our team is poised to deliver in 2023 and beyond. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more detail on the quarter and the expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 24.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 7.5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Strength over the holiday travel season also benefited results. Adjusted EBITDA was $740 million in the fourth quarter, up 45% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Outperformance was driven by better-than-expected fee growth, particularly in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, as well as roughly $30 million in COVID-related government subsidies, which benefited our ownership portfolio. Recovery in Japan following borders reopening in October also contributed to strong performance in ownership. Management and franchise fees grew 31% year-over-year, driven by continued RevPAR improvement. Good cost discipline further benefited results. For the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.59, increasing 121% year-over-year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 20% year-over-year and increased 8% versus 2019. All three segments showed quarter-over-quarter improvement as compared to ‘19, with performance continuing to be led by strong leisure demand. Both business transient and group RevPAR recovered to above 2019 peak levels for the first time since the pandemic began, driven by continued recovery in occupancy and strong rate. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 53% year-over-year and 25% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand over the holiday travel season, particularly at resort properties where RevPAR was up over 60% versus peak levels. In Europe, RevPAR grew 67% year-over-year and 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from continued strength in leisure demand and recovery in international inbound travel, particularly from the U.S. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 26% year-over-year and 34% versus 2019. The region benefited from international inbound travel during the World Cup in Qatar. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR was up 29% year-over-year and down 19% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 37% compared to 2019, taking a step back quarter-over-quarter as loosening travel restrictions led to a surge of new COVID cases. Demand is expected to gradually recover throughout the year, but remains volatile in the near term due to rising infections. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw significant improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 8% versus 2019. Performance was largely driven by strength in Japan following borders reopening. Turning to development. For the full year, we grew net units 4.7%, modestly lower than expected, largely due to the ongoing COVID environment in China, which weighed on fourth quarter openings. Conversions accounted for 24% of our gross openings for the year. And additionally, our pipeline grew year-over-year, ending 2022 at more than 416,000 rooms, with nearly 60% of those located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Looking to the year ahead, despite the near-term macroeconomic uncertainty, we are encouraged by the robust demand for Hilton-branded products in both the U.S. and international markets. For full year 2023, we expect net unit growth of between 5% and 5.5%. Turning to the balance sheet. In January, we completed an amendment to our revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity under the facility to $2 billion and extend the maturity to 2028. As we look ahead, we continue to remain confident in the strength of our liquidity position and financial flexibility. Moving to guidance. For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 23% and 27% year-over-year. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.08 and $1.14. For full year 2023, we expect RevPAR growth between 4% and 8%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $5.42 and $5.68. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $123 million in dividends for the year. For full year 2022, we returned more than $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.7 billion and $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thank you, and thanks for all the color you provided. Kevin or Chris, whoever wants to kind of tackle it, obviously, given the strength in the first quarter and acknowledging there’s seasonality and it doesn’t flow this simply, it does look like, at least for the back half of the year, you guys are looking at a flattening out. Could you kind of -- RevPAR, could you more or less frame kind of how you’re thinking about the back half from a macro perspective? And what’s more or less embedded in your guidance as it relates to the economy?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, listen, you can see in the fourth quarter -- first of all, thanks for the question. I think that is the $64,000 question on everybody’s mind. I mean, you could see in the fourth quarter, we had really good strength across all the segments. We’re early in the year. But in the first quarter, we continue to see that that strength continue in substance relative to 2019, obviously, versus 2022, it’s way up because of the Omicron impact. But we continue, from a fundamentals of the industry point of view, to feel very good about things. I mean, if the fundamentals are supply and demand, that’s what ultimately drives the result. The supply side is quite muted. We’re currently experiencing -- using the U.S. market, which is our biggest market, as an example, equal to the lowest levels of supply that we’ve seen. Thankfully, we get more than our fair share. But overall in the market, very low levels of supply. And that continues to be met with very strong demand. And we have not seen, for the record, any weakening. We have not -- we haven’t like seen any telltale signs. There are no threats of like any of our major segments sort of backing up. What I think is driving that is some of those cyclical and secular sort of tailwinds. First, you continue to see consumers shifting how they’re spending their money. So, maybe they’re spending a little bit less, but how they’re spending it, it continues to be shifted more towards experiences where sort of exhibit A on the experience side. The international markets are opening up. People -- you’re starting to see not just inbound to the U.S. but across the world, people traveling. Asia Pacific is opening up pretty fully. It will take a little bit more time. We saw that happen in Japan in the fourth quarter, which raged. We had strong results. So, we get the full benefit of that. China is obviously going through sort of what we went through 12 to 18 months ago with herd immunity and the like. But our view is that’s happening quite rapidly. On the ground, you’re already starting to see significant travel within China in terms of uptick. And we expect, particularly in the second half of the year, you’re going to have a big tailwind from that. And there continues to be broader pent-up demand across all segments. I mean, you could argue in the leisure side, some of that has -- the people have been doing a lot of it, but we don’t see them slowing down. So, we continue to think people partly because of the shift in -- as I mentioned, towards experiences, we continue to see strength there. On the business transient side, still good demand, very strong demand and growing demand, lots of pent-up demand. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we finished the second half of last year on the group side as people really got comfortable, we were through COVID and they could start planning events. They’ve been planning them like crazy. Even the biggest groups, all the association stuff, that really starts to hit the second half of this year because of all of the planning. Some of that’s happening. I’ve been in a lot of big events, speaking at them lately. But the group demand, which I think is pretty resilient, just because people have gone years without doing things that they need to do for survival, is pretty resilient. So, those are -- the economics of supply and demand are really good. To be specific, Carlo, and a very fair question, when we’ve given you a range of 4% to 8%, what did we sort of build into it? I mean, part of the reason that you’re suggesting a flattening or decel because, let’s be honest, it’s math. I mean, we’re going to be way up. You saw our guidance for the first quarter. The world was partly shut down in the first quarter last year. So, that’s just a comparability issue. But we have anticipated, right or wrong, we’ve tried to be conservative that the second half of the year, you’ll see macro economic conditions slow. So, if you were to categorize it, I would describe it as we have assumed in the second half of the year sort of a plateauing related to what we think will be a moderate recessionary environment in the second half of this year. And that’s what we have sort of built into what we’ve suggested to you in the numbers today.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, Chris. Thanks. That’s super helpful. And then just one follow-up. As you guys think about ‘23 and obviously, some projects that likely were slated for the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, kind of slipping into ‘23. As it pertains to conversion activity as a percentage of the unit growth this year, would you think that that 24% is better, or would you think it’s higher or lower than that 24% that you experienced in ‘22?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Carl, we think it’s going to be higher. I mean a couple of different reasons. One, conversions continue to be more important as the world gets a little bit tougher, although those conditionings are loosening. It has been tougher for new construction, as you know. So conversions become even more important. And then, Spark, as we’ve talked about in our prepared remarks, is a 100% conversion brand. So, we don’t think there’s going to be a ton of those introduced this year. But by the end of the year, we’ll start delivering those. And so that will drive a little bit higher level of conversion. So, the way we think about it, we don’t guide specifically, but higher than that 24%, say, probably 30% or higher for the year.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: So, I just wanted to see, Chris, if you could talk about what’s embedded in the second half of this year’s guidance with respect to U.S. occupancy and pricing changes on a year-over-year basis?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, I’m not going to get highly specific because we gave you a range and it would be hard to do the range that way. But I would say, directionally, the way to think about it is that occupancy sort of flattens out. We don’t believe -- and at least in the numbers we’re giving you, we don’t anticipate that occupancy even gets back to 2019 levels. RevPAR levels, we think, throughout the year will be higher because of rate integrity. For all the reasons I described in my filibuster off of Carlo’s question, we do continue to believe we will have good pricing power, at least through this year, simply because there is no capacity addition really coming into the market. But in U.S. -- the question about the U.S. market, and we do have these both cyclical and secular tailwinds that are giving us increases in demand that we think are going to allow us to continue to have pricing power. We’re not -- assuming in the second half of the year that pricing power is increasing, I would say, we assume it’s flattening or maybe even modestly lower to get to the ranges in numbers that we’ve suggested to you. So, on the occupancy side, if the world is better than everybody thinks, there may be some opportunities. Again, we -- at a very high level, we’ve assumed not a crash landing, sort of soft to bumpy landing in the U.S. with a moderate recessionary environment in the second half. But with some structural things that are going to help the business globally that I talked about and help the business in the U.S. in terms of spending patterns, group demand and pent-up demand on certain categories of business travel.
Joe Greff: Great. And just as my follow-up, Chris or Kevin, when you think about the fees not related to RevPAR growth in the franchise and the licensing line, specifically the credit fees as well as royalty fees coming from timeshare, do you think that grows in line with RevPAR, or how are you thinking about how that changes over the course of this year versus last year?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Joe, I think, look, historically -- or not historically, over the last few years, it’s been less volatile, right? So, if RevPAR was up 45%ish for the year this year, those fees were up something less than that, although still very robustly. And HGV is public, so you can look at what they’ve grown when they report. I think in a more normalized RevPAR environment of 4% to 8%, they should grow slightly high -- they should grow at a rate that’s better than the overall business. And so largely dependent on spend, although our credit card program set a record for spend in the fourth quarter and for the full year, would spend about 50% higher than it was even in 2019. So, that program is doing quite well, although it should be -- it should grow better than RevPAR over time, but it will be a little bit less volatile than it’s been just given what’s been going on in the world.
Operator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Chris or Kevin, just maybe we could talk about the development side. I mean, obviously, the kind of shifts from China side, the overall outlook on the construction starts remains robust, and we just continue to get a lot of investor concern about the ability of developers to finance new projects. How has that changed with the interest rate environment or the economy? So, how did your conversations go kind of throughout the quarter? And then, if you could talk, maybe dig -- as my follow-up, dig a little bit deeper into Spark. There’s been a bit of concern or question in the past about kind of going further down in the chain scales and just hoping you could unpack that a little bit for us. Why is right now the opportunity set right for moving into the premium economy space?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Shaun. Thanks. I’ll start with sort of maybe the construction trends more broadly and then maybe hand it off to Chris to cover Spark a little bit. I think what you’ve seen -- look, there’s a lot of puts and takes, right? So, you’re talking about the interest rate environment and availability of capital. And obviously, rates are a lot higher than they had been. And availability of capital is a little bit more constrained, but there’s still plenty of money available for the right projects in the world. If you think about what’s going on at the local and regional bank level is different than what’s going on at the money center banks in terms of capital constraints and things like that. You have some headwinds as we would say in terms of construction costs coming down. They’re still higher than they were in 2019 by about 20% to 30%, but that’s off of peaks and moving in the right direction. And then, as we’ve been talking about the fundamental environment gives people more confidence that when the hotel -- when they develop the hotel and it opens, it will perform at a higher level than maybe it otherwise would have. So, their pro forma goes up. So, you sort of put all that into gonculator, and that’s why starts started to build in the U.S. and ended up higher in the U.S. last year than they were the year before. It depends on where you are in the world. Obviously, it was really difficult -- not only was it difficult to get hotels open/impossible in China at the end of the year because, literally, the offices that gave you your certificate of occupancy were closed. And so, that’s why you saw a little bit of softness in our NUG. That same environment is going on in starts. So, if you’re in China, starts have been behind. But we think starts are going to continue to build from here. The fundamental setup does give developers optimism. And the way they’re thinking about it, they can absorb, not in all cases but in a lot of cases, they can absorb a higher cost of their construction loan and thinking that the world will be in a better place when they open the hotel, it will perform better and that when they roll their construction loan into a permanent loan, then hopefully, the rate environment will be a little bit more normalized. So, those are sort of some of the puts and takes of what’s going on in the world.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, supporting that, and I’ll talk about Spark. When we talk to our owners, I would say at this point, the majority of our system are making more money. Each individual hotels are making more money than they were at the peak of 2019. So, that’s driving optimism. And the reason they’re making money is more efficiencies, higher margins, obviously, rate integrity and pricing power has helped that. But they’ve got -- the bulk of the portfolio is producing more free cash flow than it ever has, and this is the business they’re in. And many of them are quite good at finding the money in a local and regional context as they have decades-long relationships. And as Kevin said, that’s why you saw in the second half of the year, we saw an inflection point where starts started to go up here in the U.S. and generally around the world. And we think that trend -- we don’t see anything that suggests that trend is reversing itself. On Spark, listen, we spent a lot of time. We -- the truth is we have been thinking about something in this space for a long, long time, almost the entire time I’ve been at the Company. We had a lot -- obviously, we’ve doubled the size of our brand portfolio. So it’s not like we’ve been sitting around doing nothing. We had not entered that zone. But three years ago or so, we started to look at it and say, like, because it’s a very big customer base, it’s a huge opportunity to better serve our existing customers, but also an important opportunity to acquire new customers, if you look at that customer base, at least half, probably, I think, arguably more than half of that customer base or customers that are early in their travel lives that are going to grow up and do other things. And the sooner you get them into the system and building loyalty with them, the better off you are. So, as always, when we look at brands, it starts with a sort of a customer acquisition and a network -- continuing to build the network effect for our existing customer base. So, we were confident when we started looking at it three years ago that there was a lot of reasons to be serious about it. Then comes the hard part of trying to figure out how do we engineer something at this price point that really works, that it works for customers, meaning that the experience they have with us is going to be great, friendly, reliable, consistent and that we can apply the same magic, if you will, from a commercial point of view to our ownership community that we have in our other brands so that we drive superior performance to our competition. And so, there’s a reason we spent three years on it because it’s not easy, but we think we figured it out. I would say, and time will tell, this will be the most disruptive thing we’ve done in terms of brand space because it is very ripe for disruption. If you go look at hotels at this price point in this segment, you will find a very high beta situation in terms of the physical attributes. And it’s very hard to fix when you have a big system that’s already out there. So, you’d say, well, this is all conversion. It is all conversion. But what we did over the last few years is figure out with our supply management team, with our design teams, with our brand teams and everybody else in this company, how can we engineer a product where every single hotel, 100% of the time when it comes in the system has been refreshed, everything that is customer-facing. We built it, we built the rooms, we put it in real hotels, we built the lobbies. And we brought customers in to say, is this what you want? Is it different? And so, what will be different about this in this space and why I am not worried about it and why, frankly, I’m -- I mean it’s not sexy, okay? It’s not as sexy as lifestyle luxury. But in terms of an opportunity to be a value contributor in the billions of dollars for this company and its shareholders, I’m as excited about this as anything else we’ve done because from a customer point of view, we are going to give them a high-quality, consistent experience at this price point that does not exist in the market because of the way we’ve engineered the retrofit of these properties. And this will ultimately take some time, but it can happen quickly. It will be thousands -- it’s the biggest segment in the U.S. It’s the biggest segment in Europe. I mean, it will be thousands -- it should be, over time, the biggest brand we have in terms of number of units. And as I said, most importantly, it always starts with what is best for better serving our existing customers and acquiring new customers. And how do we do it in a way that owners will get a superior return. We think we have cracked the code. We will have to prove it. It will come to life quite quickly. As Kevin said, we will have Sparks open this year, won’t have a too terribly big impact on this year’s numbers. But as we get into next year and beyond, we think it will have a meaningful impact. And as I said, ultimately, I look at these as opportunities as a consumer branded company to think about a new product at our scale, being able to be deployed at scale, deployed globally and have the opportunity to be worth billions of dollars to our shareholders. And I think this is -- checks all of those boxes. So, we’re super excited. We’re not nervous. We’ve done all the work. I hope we’ve proven at this point, given this is the tenth or 11th brand that we’ve created out of the ashes or out of the dust that we’re pretty good at this at this point.
Operator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you a little bit on the owned and leased portfolio. I think you mentioned $30 million of COVID-related subsidies, I think, during the quarter. And I was just wondering, should we just assume that those start to kind of dissipate as we go through 2023, or are they just all gone at this point, or how are you thinking about that?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think it’s played through based on the programs that have been approved thus far in Europe. I mean, if -- there’s maybe a little bit more to come through based on things we’ve for that haven’t quite come yet, through a very small amount. And who knows, if anything more will come, but we’re not expecting any. And the thing I would say is if you look at it on a normalized basis, because remember, we had subsidies in 2021 as well, if you sort of pull all that out, the growth has been quite dramatic. And we continue to think that that portfolio will grow at a higher rate than the overall business this year.
Smedes Rose: Great. Thank you. And then, Chris, I’m just wondering if you could just touch on -- you mentioned the U.S. pipeline, and we all see what’s happening there. Any change in the way that Hilton is thinking about using key money in order to maintain or grow share or potentially lend to developers at this point, or...?
Chris Nassetta: No, no. As I commented on in my prepared remarks, and if you look at the whole pipeline, more than 90% of it has no key money, no financial support. We have not changed our view on that. If you look at the aggregate dollars in CapEx, and you peeled out what we’re spending in key money, actually, if you average last year and this year together because we had some things we thought would happen last year that are happening this year, it’s actually lower than what we’ve been suggesting to everybody over the last couple of quarters. So no, I don’t -- we still view the opportunity to grow as very strong and without the use of our balance sheet and that ultimately is driven by what you would guess it is. Everybody investing in our portfolio of brands is doing it to get a return, and our brands are the highest performing brands in individual segments. But overall, when you aggregate them together, and people are continuing to want to invest with us in that way. So, a long-winded way of saying, no, we don’t see anything. In fact, I think the trend line for us overall in key money, I’m looking at Kevin, he runs development, too, so make sure he agrees with this. But the trend line is down, meaning over the last couple of years, we’ve had a little bit of elevated key money in aggregate dollars because during COVID, a bunch of things we’ve been working on a long time came together or some other people’s deals blew up, and we were able to sweep in on some very strategic things at a moment in time. And those were lumpy, but we always have opportunities we’re working on. But I think those lumpy -- there are going to be fewer of those lumpy things. So, I think -- honestly, I think in an aggregate dollar sense over the next few years, the trend line is down, not up.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Just following on some of the earlier discussions about the thoughtful conservatism baked into the guidance. Could we talk about the capital returns a bit and just how you thought about pulling that together? And is that necessarily a kind of firm number in view of how the guidance is set up? And what could push that up or down going forward?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. David, I have to say that, yes, it’s a firm number. We wouldn’t have given it to you. I assume that goes without saying, but I can’t help myself. So yes, as of now, it’s a firm number. That’s what we think. It’s a range for a reason. There’s a lot of year left and a lot could happen. I think if -- I did read your note this morning, so I think I know where you’re going with this. Right now, we’re a little bit lower than our historic range of leverage. That range does assume effectively no borrowing for the year because we think that the borrowing -- and we don’t like the borrowing environment right now. It’s very choppy. Rates are higher than we used to. And so, that assumes that leverage stays roughly flat to slightly down for the year. And that’s what -- and yes, that’s what the range of guidance and EBITDA will spit out for capital return, again, recognizing that we’re a very high free cash flow business. And we don’t do -- other than what we were just talking about with a little bit of key money and a little bit of capital, we don’t do much else with the money other than pay a small dividend and use it for buybacks. And so, that’s the range for now.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. The only thing I would add -- all of that I agree wholeheartedly. The only thing I would add to that is that’s not -- our longer-range views on the balance sheet and return of capital haven’t changed. We have been very consistent since the beginning of time. It feels like saying we want to be 3 to 3.5 times. We’re at the low end or below -- a little bit below the low end of the range for the reasons Kevin just described. We think debt markets are choppy. They’ll get better. Over the intermediate and longer term, we don’t intend to run leverage at those levels. We would intend to be in the ranges, frankly, and that’s -- we’ve said it on these calls, probably towards the high end of the range, in a more normalized environment or even beyond that is something that we would certainly -- we’ve been asked and said many times publicly, we would consider. We just need -- we’re just looking for a little bit more stability in the debt markets. And obviously, as Kevin said, we don’t have the need. And as I commented in my answer to the earlier question on key money, which is the primary use in terms of CapEx, we don’t think we need a whole lot more. So, any borrowing, any re-leveraging or leveraging up, obviously, this affords us the opportunity to return even more capital. So, I think there will -- those opportunities will exist. We gave you what we think right now, and we’ll see how the debt markets and broadly how the macro sort of shifts going forward.
David Katz: I appreciate that. And everything is well received since I misspoken my question. I know -- mean what we say. Can we talk about the new brand just a bit? Am I taking away from the notion that you are fitting yourself into a space where there aren’t necessarily direct competitors, or there are and you believe you’ve come up with a better value proposition that will just compete?
Chris Nassetta: I would say we don’t think there are any real competitors. I mean, meaning that, if we do our job, we’re going to sort of come in plus or minus 20% below true, which would still probably be above, if you look on average, it will be above where most of the folks in the existing segment are. That’s why, like we like to do, we’re a branding company. We’ve made up a segment. We called it premium economy. So, our view would be it is above the traditional economy space. It will price above, both because of the strength of our system, our commercial engines, loyalty system and all those things, but importantly, because it will be a better, higher quality, more consistent product.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: My question and follow-up are both really sort of clarifications on earlier comment. Chris, you said in your guidance, you were assuming that pricing power would flatten or even be modestly lower later in the year. I just wanted to clarify, were you saying pricing power like the rate of increase modestly lower or actually some rate actually lower? Just to clarify.
Chris Nassetta: Not rates actually lowered. Just basically, plateauing relative to ‘19 in the second half of the year.
Robin Farley: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then on occupancy, you mentioned that your guidance, you’re really not even getting back to occupancy in 2019. I’m assuming that’s just sort of a matter of time and that you would expect to be there by 2024, or are you -- do you have a view about…
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean -- honestly, I think it may be a bit of conservatism on our part. I do think we get -- by the way, Robin, we can get back there tomorrow if we wanted. But we could jump rates because we could occupy ourselves up. But we don’t want to do that. We actually manage, as you can see with the rate growth, we are trying to manage in this cycle, particularly given the environment, inflation and everything else, really effectively to drive the best bottom line results for our owners, in this case, that to a degree, our occupancy levels are driven by pricing strategies. Okay? Some of it is still -- I think there is more recovery and more pent-up demand, particularly business travel and the group segment. So, I absolutely believe there’s never been a cycle that I’m aware of that in recorded history where we will not go above prior occupancy level, so I think that we will. It may happen this year. Honestly, if we continue to have pricing power, I kind of hope it doesn’t. And I hope it happens next year that we continue to be able to drive rate and thus higher margins and more profitability for our ownership community.
Robin Farley: Great. And then just my other clarification on your net unit guidance. From the comment in the release, I guess, I kind of understood the sort of the coming in just under 5% of the COVID delays in China that it was maybe some openings that were sort of pushed past December 31 in China that would maybe make then Q1 opening sort of ahead of the full year number. But then in your comments, you made a comment about starts in China being behind. So I guess, I just wanted to get some clarification on whether it was just openings delayed by a few weeks or sort of a broader issue with the unit growth in China if starts are also behind?
Kevin Jacobs: I think it’s both, Robin. I mean, the environment is creating a drag both -- created a drag in the fourth quarter on openings and also has created a drag on starts because it’s just broadly when they reopen and then -- before it was lockdown, now it’s they reopen and everybody gets sick, but the net result is the business activity comes -- is a drag on business activity. So signing starts and opens were all affected by it. We don’t think it’s a long-term trend in China. We think it’s timing. And yes, by definition, if we -- as I said earlier in the Q&A, if there was an environment where you literally have a completed hotel that can’t open because it can’t get a significant of occupancy, we don’t give you quarterly guidance. So, we’re not going to get into like when those hotels are going to open. But I think you can assume they’re going to open on a delay.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: I guess, if I stare long enough at your release, I find one negative number, which is pricing is down year-on-year for the Waldorf Astoria. Is there any particular pricing pressure at high-end hotels you’re seeing, or is that mix? And maybe more broadly on pricing, I guess what I observed is, you seem to have taken a little bit less pricing than some of your peers and your occupancies recovered a little bit quicker. Would that match what the strategy has been? And does that give you maybe a few more buttons to compress on pricing further through the recovery?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. First of all on Waldorf, there’s no -- that’s driven by individual hotels. Just the Waldorf brand, unlike our other brands, there’s not so many hotels that one dynamic in one particular market or two markets will drive it. So, there’s no -- we’re not broadly seeing slowdown in luxury. To the contrary, we’re continuing to see -- we’re continuing to see great strength. I’ll dish the second part of that to K.J.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Rich, I’m sorry, I didn’t -- maybe a little bit of clarification on the second part. I’m not fully understanding where you were going with that. I’m sorry.
Richard Clarke: Sure. I guess, when I look at your pricing relative to the market, relative to some of your closest peers, it seems you’ve increased prices a little bit less than some peers and your occupancies recovered quicker than some peers. Is that in line with your sort of strategy?
Kevin Jacobs: No. Our market share is up across the board, right? So, we’re driving better revenue outcomes than our competitors. You may be looking at individual. I don’t know what you’re looking at in terms of our competitors or individual sort of spot rates for year-on-year. We’d be happy to…
Chris Nassetta: The simplest way to look -- system-wide last year, we finished in share at the highest levels in our history, and we gained share both in rate and occupancy. So -- but those numbers across the system would not support that theory.
Richard Clarke: Okay. And maybe just a quick follow-up. The reasonable size adjustment in the net other expenses from managed and franchise, the pass-through costs that have been negative through the rest of the year. Looking like maybe you’re clawing back some of the losses through COVID. So, just wondering if there’s some specific program that’s pivoted that the other way in Q4?
Kevin Jacobs: No. There’s always timing issues in terms of those line items. In the end, we have revenue and all of our various funds and programs are going to run breakeven over time, and then you’re just seeing timing issues on the P&L.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: I wanted to ask about the tight labor market that we continue to hear about in terms of the -- from the Fed’s reporting. Obviously, very strong in the experiential category on travel and lodging. So, do you believe this has peaked when you talk to your partners, kind of your builders? What are they saying just in terms of the labor market? And then secondarily, how does that factor into how you’re thinking about IMFs and kind of profits in the back half of the year if it hasn’t? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, the labor market situation has eased a lot. So as we talk to -- I mean, listen, we employ a lot of people. We operate a lot of hotels because I talk to our team, but beyond that, talk to our franchise community. I think they would say that broadly, we are not fully back to where we were in terms of access to labor, but we’re getting awfully close. And so, if it was on a scale of 1 to 10 a year ago a 10 in terms of extremis, it’s a 4 or 5. I mean, it was something we were talking about every single day, every conversation, and it is not quite as topical, which is the good indication. So, I think the labor situation is easing. You continue to see across a broad universe of other industries, notwithstanding what the Fed is saying, a lot of layoffs, including, of course, through technology, but through banking, also through retail, where people had really staffed up thinking that the COVID retail demand was going to be maintained and it hasn’t. And so, there are a lot of people that are getting pushed back out into the job market, and that’s allowing -- affording us the opportunity to get the labor that we need. You’ve also seen, while wage rates went up a lot during COVID, net-net from ‘19 to now, you’ve seen that start to stabilize. And those kind of big increases are not continuing. They’re at a higher absolute level, but the level -- the rate of increase has diminished substantially. In terms of how we think about IMF, we feel good about IMF. I think for the year, we expect IMF to add significantly to the growth rate. We think this year we expect that it will get over our prior high watermark of ‘19.
Chad Beynon: Great. And then secondly, just in terms of FX, the dollar has weakened a little bit against kind of the basket of the non-U.S. currencies. How are you thinking about an operational impact from that? And then also, as that kind of feeds into guidance, is there a translational impact with just a slightly weaker dollar versus what you saw in ‘22?
Kevin Jacobs: Operationally, obviously, it has effects in each individual market where your pricing labor in those currencies. It’s a very small headwind single-digit millions of dollars headwind in this year’s numbers.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: You talked about the strength of leisure in the fourth quarter and all of last year. But when you think about leisure demand this year, how would your RevPAR 4% to 8% growth for the year, how would that -- would leisure be in that range, or there’s a lot of concern that it’s going to be significantly below that?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I think we do think it would be within that range. We continue to see strength. We do expect like all the segments that you will see some plateauing as a result of a slower macro environment in the second half of the year. But we still feel very good about it. The demand trends here and now are really strong. And while there’s a lot of noise out there, if you go back -- just went back and looked at the number, consumers still have incremental savings in the U.S. relative to the month before COVID of $1.5 trillion. Now -- so that peaked at like $2.7 trillion. It’s down to $1.5 trillion. So, they are spending it, and they’re probably reading the papers and watching the news and getting more nervous. And so, that would be a behavior set that would say that maybe they pull back a little bit. But the reality is we’re not seeing it. And I think part of the reason we’re not seeing it, okay, and time will tell, is because of the phenomena that I described earlier in the call, which is they’re shifting their spending. So not only do they still have incremental savings in their pockets and feel reasonably good, but they’re spending a lot more of it at bars and restaurants and travel as a percentage of their overall spend. And so, we have anticipated, like all segments, there’ll be a little bit of a headwind in the second half of the year, but we do expect leisure to be in those ranges.
Bill Crow: If I could address my follow-up question on Spark, which is really an intriguing product. Does it kind of take care of two problems that are out there for the industry? And one is obviously a lot of deferred CapEx over the last several years. But the other one is the age of select service hotels Hampton and what started in ‘84 or ‘85. So, we’re dealing with hotels coming up on 40 years old. So, is there a -- is that part of the thought process is that you’ve got a lot of hotels that could ultimately fit within that brand?
Chris Nassetta: Listen, it is an ancillary benefit on the margin, meaning if we do have older Hamptons like other third-party products that we think aren’t fitting for Hampton, as you know, we’ve been quite disciplined in keeping the Hampton brand, the strongest brand in lodging, in my opinion, by pushing properties out that are past their prime and don’t make sense in the system. There -- I think over the next 10 years, there is some percentage of those that we will certainly look at keeping in the system. I think in the end, Bill, it will be a very small percentage of the overall system. And if I look at the deals that we have in-house right now, 98% of the deals we are processing right now are third-party brands. So, there are a few Hamptons in there. But there’s no other Hilton brands in there, but there are a few Hamptons. But I would say it’s an ancillary benefit on the margin. A lot of those hotels, frankly, over time, are going to exit the system as we’ve been doing for time and eternity.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
UnidentifiedAnalyst: [Technical Difficulty]
Chris Nassetta: Hey Greg, can you hear us? Your -- we can’t understand what you’re saying. Your connection is super garbled.
Operator: I apologize. So, we’ll have to move on to our next question. And the next question is from Brandt Montour with Barclays. Thank you.
Brandt Montour: Actually, just one from me, Chris and Kevin. So, in terms of development and more medium to longer term sort of net unit growth, and your comments were well taken, Chris, on a couple of years. The world seems to have gotten a bit better for you, though, right, since three months ago, right, in terms of the speed at which China is reopening now, the excitement over Spark and then U.S. starts continuing to get a little bit better. So I guess, the question is, do you feel a little bit better about getting back to the 6 to 7 NUG than you did three months ago? And are we potentially even playing for maybe hitting that run rate in late ‘24?
Kevin Jacobs: Look, I think we said what we said for a reason, Brandt, not to be sort of cagey about it, but there’s a lot can go one way or the other in the world. We still feel great about getting back to 6% to 7%. I don’t -- Chris may have a different view. I don’t feel differently today than I did three months ago about that. I think the world is coming our way a little bit. But we don’t expect -- none of these things stay constant, right? I mean, these trends will change, and we always think the world is going to come our way. So, I don’t feel that much better in three months from now.
Chris Nassetta: I’m probably more optimistic by nature than Kevin. That’s our roles. But no, I think we feel -- we felt pretty good about getting back to it a quarter ago. So I agree in the sense we don’t feel differently. And I think we were asked on the last call, what does it look like? And we said it looks like you get this terra firma with a view on the U.S. economy either in recession or -- where people have a little bit more certainty. I don’t think we’ve accomplished -- that hasn’t really changed. Then, we said China, okay, that we got to get China back and reopened. And while it’s not fully reopened, it’s happening. So I think on the margin, we feel better about that. And we didn’t have -- we in our heads had Spark, but we didn’t tell you about Spark. And so, we now have Spark there, and I think that provides, no pun intended, a little bit of spark to our progress in getting back there. So, we felt pretty good about it a quarter ago. I think we feel pretty good about it now.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us. As you can imagine -- or I hope you would imagine, we’re pleased with the state of the recovery, fourth quarter numbers are great. While we’re sentient and watching the macro trends, we feel very good about what we’re seeing right now in the business and advanced bookings and all the things that sidelines that we have into the business. We think we’re going to have another really good year. And we appreciate the support. We appreciate the time. We look forward to catching up with everybody after the first quarter to give you more sightlines into what we’re seeing then. So, thank you, and have a great day.
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-10-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations & Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s third quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed on today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.Hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. The third quarter marked a very important milestone in our continued recovery. For the first time since the pandemic began, system-wide RevPAR surpassed 2019 levels. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance and 2019 levels. We achieved several notable development milestones in the quarter, including reaching 100,000 rooms open across Europe, and announced various strategic partnerships, further enhancing the guest experience and the strength of our global system. The quarter's strong performance, coupled with our capital-light business model, enabled us to continue returning meaningful capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $1.3 billion. And for the full year, we're on track to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders. Turning to the specifics results in the quarter, occupancy reached more than 73%, only four points shy of 2019 levels. As expected, strong travel demand continued through the summer months, primarily driven by robust leisure trends. Post Labor Day, demand remained strong as business transient and group demand improved significantly and leisure demand remained robust. Overall demand for the quarter peaked in September, nearly reaching 2019 levels with business transient demand only two points off 2019 levels. ADR also continued to strengthen and proving quarter-over-quarter and up 11% versus 2019. Rates across all segments surpass 2019 levels, with leisure transient rates up in the high-teens and both business transient and grew up in the mid-single digits. All of this translated into third quarter system-wide RevPAR growth of approximately 30% year-over-year, and 5% compared to 2019 levels, with each month surpassing prior peaks. Leisure transient RevPAR continued to lead the recovery, exceeding 2019 levels by more than 11% for the quarter. Business transient RevPAR reached 2019 levels, with notable acceleration in large corporate business. Our top 20 business accounts are now just 3% shy of 2019 levels, with forward bookings trending above 2019. Small and medium-sized businesses remain ahead of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR reached roughly 93% of prior peak levels for the quarter, with company meetings improving significantly as a percentage of mix. We expect trends to remain strong for the balance of the year with system-wide RevPAR once again surpassing 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Leisure transient RevPAR is expected to remain meaningfully above prior peaks, driven by solid consumer confidence and continued eagerness and ability to travel. We expect business transient RevPAR to continue to see gradual recovery, primarily driven by rising demand as companies encourage their people to get back on the road. System-wide group position for the fourth quarter is approximately 5% above 2019 levels, accelerating over the last several months, largely due to a robust demand pipeline. Additionally, rates on new bookings are up in the mid to high-teens versus 2019, with group mix continuing to normalize. Company meetings and convention business make up a larger percentage of forward bookings versus the same period in 2019. As we look ahead, we remain very optimistic about the future of travel. Despite near-term macro headwinds, we're not seeing any signs that fundamentals are weakening. Rising demand, coupled with historically low industry supply growth, should continue to drive strong pricing power. Consumers are shifting back to spending on experiences, international borders are reopening and pent-up demand is being released across all segments. Consumers still have an estimated $2.4 trillion of excess savings accumulated during the pandemic, or approximately 55% more in their checking and savings accounts than they did in 2019. Additionally, according to a recent global Hilton study, 85% of business travelers hope to travel as much or more next year, and group position for 2023 is less than 10% shy of 2019 peak levels, with a tentative pipeline up significantly. While the macro environment is more challenging, we are in the midst of a strong rebound with secular tailwinds that should support continued growth. Turning to development, we opened 80 properties, totaling nearly 13,000 rooms in the quarter and achieved several important milestones, including reaching 100,000 rooms in Europe, 25,000 Curio rooms globally and 600 Hilton Hotels & Resorts. All of our brands continue growing at a healthy pace given their distinct identities and compelling value propositions for both owners and guests. According to STR, our year-to-date net additions remain higher than all major branded competitors, demonstrating the power of our disciplined development strategy and the strength of our industry-leading RevPAR index premiums. During the quarter, we signed approximately 20,000 rooms, bringing our pipeline to a record 416,000 rooms, half of which are under construction. Signings were boosted by strong RevPAR performance in the US, which drove greater owner optimism around the recovery. While macro factors tempered international signings, we were thrilled to announce nine landmark agreements to expand our luxury presence across seven countries in the Asia Pacific region, including the Conrad, Singapore Orchard. We also signed agreements to grow our flagship Hilton brand in Malaysia, Waldorf and Morocco in what will become our first system-wide tempo property in Times Square. Construction starts outperformed expectations in the quarter, largely due to better activity in the US as the cost of materials stabilized and demand for residential construction declined. According to STR, Hilton is the only major hotel company to deliver year-to-date growth in its under construction pipeline. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 5%, and we expect mid-single-digit growth for the next couple of years before returning to our historical growth rate of 6% to 7%. With even more exciting destinations to enjoy, we continue strengthening our value proposition for Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 19% year-over-year to $146 million, and members accounted for more than 61% of occupancy, up 200 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. We also continue to invest in new innovations focused on ensuring we deliver reliable friendly stays that meet guests' evolving needs. An overwhelming 98% of guests in a recent survey said they are prioritizing wellness activities while on the road. During the quarter, we announced an industry-first partnership with Peloton to add Peloton bikes in every fitness center across all of our 5,400 US properties by year-end. Our extremely talented team works tirelessly to execute on a great strategy, and we continue to be recognized for our award winning culture. Hilton was recently named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the US and the number two on the World's Best Workplaces by Fortune and Great Place to Work, our seventh consecutive year on the list and the only hospitality company on the list. As we begin a new golden age of travel, I think we're better positioned than ever. Our brands are performing at their highest levels, we're running our highest margins in our company's history and we're on track to generate our highest levels of free cash flow yet. Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you a bit more details on the quarter and our expectations for the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 29.9% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis and increased 5% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, as well as steady recovery in business transient and group travel. Adjusted EBITDA was $732 million in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and up 41% year-over-year. Our performance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and Europe. Results also benefited from further recovery in our European ownership portfolio. Management franchise fees grew 33%, driven by continued RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Good cost control continued to benefit results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $1.31, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 68% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 22% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by strong leisure demand over the summer travel season, with continued recovery in business transient and group travel further benefiting results. Total US business transient reached 2019 levels for the quarter, with US group RevPAR up 7 percentage points quarter-over-quarter to 95% of 2019 peak levels. In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR increased 74% year-over-year and was up 17% versus 2019. Performance was driven by continued strength in leisure demand, particularly across resort properties where ADR was up more than 20%. In Europe, RevPAR grew 92% year-over-year and was up 20% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel throughout the summer. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 45% year-over-year and was up 6% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from strong leisure demand and international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR was up 46% year-over-year and down 16% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 14% compared to 2019, improving 33 percentage points quarter-over-quarter as leisure demand picked up over the school holidays and COVID lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing were lifted in July. Travel demand remains volatile in China as a result of strict COVID policies and restrictions to contain new outbreaks. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw continued improvement with RevPAR, excluding China, up 10 points quarter-over-quarter, with September RevPAR down just 8% to 2019. We remain optimistic about further recovery across the entire Asia Pacific region as travel restrictions continue to ease and borders reopen to international travel. For example, our recent booking pace in Japan has already started to increase following the recent government stimulus announcement and border openings. Turning to development. Our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially, totaling nearly 416,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with nearly 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the US and roughly half under construction. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings of approximately 100,000 rooms globally with US signings exceeding 2019 levels. Despite the near-term macroeconomic challenges, we remain confident in our ability to deliver net unit growth in the mid-single-digit range for the next couple of years. Moving to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 19% and 23% year-over-year or up 2% to 6% compared to fourth quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $641 million and $671 million and adjusted EPS adjusted for special items -- I'm sorry, diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.15 and $1.23. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 40% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 3%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.5 billion and $2.53 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA by nearly 10%. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.46 and $4.54. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $41 million year-to-date. Our Board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our third quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning, Chris, Kevin, Jill.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff: I wanted to talk about corporate negotiated rates. Can you give us some perspective on how important or what percentage of your room nights, pre-pandemic room nights associated with corporate rate negotiations accounted for as a percentage of the total? And then as you think about those negotiations that are ongoing now for next year, do you get the sense that more companies that were traditionally part of the corporate rate negotiations are opting to go to a more dynamic, less contractual rate type of model?
Chris Nassetta: I'll take it in the order you gave it. Just by way of background, you asked where was it in 2019. It was about 10% of our overall business in 2019. At the moment, it's about 7% of our overall business. And that is largely at this point given the big accounts are coming back by choice because we have chosen to pivot our mix as we've been talking about for the last several quarters a little bit more heavily towards SMB, small and medium-sized enterprises, simply because they are higher rated and more resilient through ups and downs. Having said that, our big corporate customers have been customers of ours a long time, and they're important, but we have weighted that down. I think as they I mentioned that we were most recently only really about 3% off with our top 20, my guess is that 7% will go up a bit, but our objective is to keep it a bit lower than 2019. We're early in that negotiation season, and what I can say at this point in talking to our teams is the vast majority of those accounts are going to dynamic pricing. That's something that we've been doing over a very long period of time, even pre-COVID. We did have the majority of the accounts dynamic, but we had a decent chunk, I want to say, 25% or 30% pre-COVID. And through the last few years, we've moved very aggressively to get more people dynamic. So at this point, the majority of them are dynamic. And I think that all customers understand because of what they're dealing with in every aspect of their life, that is that, at least at the moment, inflation is a real thing and that their expectation is that they're going to have to pay more. And the best – it's early days. The best we think at this point is high single-digit, very low double digit sort of in 9% to 10% range is best we can figure at this moment.
Joe Greff: Great. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And the next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Chris, historically, the third quarter is kind of when we get a little bit of a taste of kind of a 2023 RevPAR outlook. And I think knowing all of the macro turmoil that's out there, it makes all the sense in the world to not maybe provide something specific. But can you just help us walk us through your thinking here, big picture? You obviously see a lot speak with a lot of people out there. So based on kind of what you know right now, maybe give us a little bit of directional color. And specifically, what can accelerate further from the trend lines that we're seeing in the third and early fourth quarter? And just how do you see it moving through the year in 2023?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I think you're right. There's a lot of macro uncertainty. And as a result, it's a little bit early for us to prognosticate on what we think for next year. Not only that, but we're just at the early stages of our budget process, which we'll be going through over the next 60 days or so, to complete by year-end. And so it is premature. Having said that, directionally, I'm happy to comment on, sort of how we and I think about it at the moment on a forward-looking basis. What we're obviously looking at, as I said in my prepared comments, is fundamentals that are currently pretty strong. And while, again, we're not naive to what's going on with the Fed here in central banks in other parts of the world in the sense of trying to tame inflation by slowing economies, we do think we have a reasonably unique setup that is maybe different than some other industries for a period of time that is going to benefit us not just in the fourth quarter, but into next year. What are those things? Not to be too redundant because I covered them briefly, the laws of economics are alive and well, supply and demand. Supply is at historically low-levels, and it's going to stay there for a while, right, just given everything that's going on from COVID and now into the macro concerns. Demand, is picking up. As I covered relative to the third quarter, our expectation is that it's going to continue to pick up into the fourth quarter. Why is it picking up? It's picking up because the segments remain strong. I mean, leisure, I covered it. People still have desire and a lot of disposable income and savings to spend and more flexibility and time. Business transient that you have a huge amount of pent-up demand that's accrued, as well as in the meetings and events segment, you have the international markets opening up. And you have a broader trend of just the secular shift or maybe cyclical shift back to the more normalized spending patterns of everybody is spending less on things and spending more on experiences. And so, that's what we're benefiting from. We obviously got hammered during COVID, unlike other industries. But now we're in this recovery. And those -- I sort of describe it here with our team and with our Board is like, you have headwinds and tailwinds. The headwinds are the macro. The world is slowing down, right? And it has to and they're going to accomplish their goal. But we have tailwinds, okay? We have these tailwinds of like spending more on experiences, international travel, pent-up demand and then just incremental demand associated with people having to run their businesses, gather and meetings and events of all sorts, whether it's social or business. And at the moment, those tailwinds are stronger than the headwinds. And I would say meaningfully stronger, which is why we would continue to recover, we continue to have pricing power. My own belief is we have enough wind in our sails to go for a while. Now, I don't – it depends on the macro and like what happens in the economy and how long does it slow for? How much does it slow? I mean, those are things I don't know. I'm not an economist, and everybody can judge for themselves. But my view is, for the next few quarters at least, those are pretty powerful tailwinds. And we're talking to customers, we're seeing daily data, we're putting our finger on as many pulses as we can to understand it. So that's a long-winded way of saying, I don't know what the answer is for next year. But my view is RevPAR is definitely going to be up, in my opinion. Year-over-year, it will definitely be over 2019 levels. And what we're going to figure out from now to the end of the year as part of the budget process and watching the macro and watching those tailwinds and headwinds fight each other, how much we think it's going to be up. But our view is that, it is definitely going to be up. We did give you some sense quickly on that, being in the mid-single digits, so similar to this year and an expectation for next year. So if you listen super carefully, that was in my prepared comments. So we are trying to give a little bit more visibility there, because we have obviously more visibility ourselves into sort of those things tracking through pipeline and under construction and delivery schedules.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Chris Nassetta: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hi, everybody. Good morning. Chris, obviously, you guys have gotten back to returning capital much in the way you did prior to the pandemic with buybacks. But since kind of coming public again, this is the first time where you've operated in an environment where interest rates were something greater than where they've been. So I'm just wondering, as you think about your capital return strategy, you think about your cost of funding, obviously you're debt, there isn't a ton that's really rate sensitive and you have some time before you have any bonds do. How does the new interest rate environment kind of factor into your capital plans?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, obviously, it factors into it. I'd say, first of all, background we're returning more capital than we ever have historically. And that's because we're producing more free cash flow than we ever have historically. And we intend to continue to do that. We have, from a balance sheet point of view, said we want to be at 3 to 3.5 times leverage. We still want to be in that zone. We have said we want to be towards the higher end of that, which would imply incremental borrowing that might increase our buyback. And at some point, there will be a time I suspect that we want to do that. At this moment with where the capital markets are, we probably are not to rush to go out and take on more debt to do that. But at the right time and the right place, there we might be. And there are obviously other ways of our raising capital in the form of shorter – our credit facilities and other facilities that we have. But at the moment, we are still at the mind 3 times to 3.5 times. We're probably, honestly, going to end the year a little bit lower than we might have guessed because of where the capital markets are. But we think those things will stabilize. And again, if there are opportunities that present themselves to do more than we're doing, we'll certainly look to take advantage of those opportunities. From a balance sheet point of view and maturity, we're in fabulous shape. Kevin, you can add on if you want. But we don't really have any meaningful maturities until 2026. We took great advantage both pre-COVID and then during COVID when the Fed leaded so hard to be so helpful to those markets to refinance and push out maturities. So we feel really good about the profile of our maturities, which is we have done for a number of years of any meaning and about what our current rate structure is.  So, I've been doing this a long time, these things go up and down. The Fed is doing what they have to do to harness demand. Ultimately, my guess is if history is any indicator of the future, and they overdo it a little and at some point in the next couple of years, it will go the other way.  And as I said, we have a number of ways to raise debt. The bond markets are one, which we don't honestly really like right now for obvious reasons and wouldn't look to enter those markets at the moment, but we have other forms of credit in the forms of our credit facility and other facilities that are shorter term and as a result, lower cost. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of it.  The answer is yes. But yes and no. I mean, yes, it impacts us, but it doesn't, in any way, change our trajectory of still returning significant the most capital that we ever have and we're going to continue -- we're going to fully plan to continue doing that on the basis that we're going to be producing more free cash flow this year. And by the way, if I'm right on RevPAR and going up, we're going to just produce more free cash flow next year. That is the – that gives us the ability to keep returning very large amounts of capital without having to necessarily borrow in a market we don't like.
Carlo Santarelli: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead. 
Smedes Rose: I wanted to ask you a little bit more about what you're seeing in China and maybe kind of what the development pipeline looks like there. And with rooms, I guess, opening just into a very depressed demand, would you expect developers to pull back there or kind of how are you thinking that plays out over the next year or so?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Smedes, what I would say is it's sort of similar to -- it's kind of a microcosm of what Chris was saying on the macro. I mean, you've got some headwinds and you've got some tailwinds, right? I mean, you definitely have macroeconomic disruption there that's been well publicized. It's also -- I think we've talked about this in prior quarters, the actual way development gets done on the ground in China is still very much a face-to-face environment, a face-to-face culture. So that's affecting our level of signings at the moment.  Interestingly enough, we've had really strong signings over the last couple of years, and so starts are up in China this year, pretty -- in third quarter pretty materially and will be up for the year. Deliveries will be up for the year. And as you know, we're pivoting to more of a limited service strategy in China that's ultimately going to be less sensitive to the macro environment over time.  And so that's all sort of a mixed view and what we would say is developer optimism remains really strong. There's a lot of demand for our brands, particularly Hampton and Home 2 that are just getting started and then we're rolling out Hilton Garden franchising. So that's sort of a long way of saying, we think the trajectory is up over time in a material way, but in the short term, you do have some choppiness.
Smedes Rose: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead. 
David Katz: Hi, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. You've given a ton of fundamental information. I get the puts and takes with all of it. I wonder if you could talk about the non-RevPAR fees to some degree as they become just an important part and how we might expect those to behave in the puts and takes around those, as well as the opportunities to grow them into other areas, et cetera, longer term. Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. It's a good question. I think we -- you've heard, David, you've heard us say in prior quarters that those fees during COVID, they were less volatile, right? They sort of went down a lot less when the world blew up, and then our expectation was that they'd go up not quite at the pace of other fees, RevPAR-driven fees during recovery. Interestingly enough, in the near term, those fees are actually growing almost at the rate of our overall fee growth, right? So we've had very strong -- I mean, our two primary ways that we generate fees, of course, are credit card fees, which have been bolstered by one change we've made to the program. I think the program is as strong as it's ever been. Obviously, consumer spending has been pretty strong. So that fuels the spend and the issuance of points and fuels remuneration. HGV is doing quite well. Their fee growth has been really strong so far this year. They're public, so you can look at their numbers. I don't have to tell you how they're doing. But you should assume that we grow kind of in lockstep with them as they recover and they grow fees. And so over time, I would say they'll continue to be a more meaningful contributor. It's hard to say, in a more normalized RevPAR environment, they probably do grow at or slightly above the level of RevPAR if trends continue, and then we'll be looking for ways to continue to grow those over time. And So we're not going to get into specifics on things that haven't happened, but you should assume that the co-brand credit card product is one that can be taken outside of the primary countries that we're in now. We're getting good growth with our new products in Japan, and we'll be looking to bring that to other countries. HGV just did an acquisition, right? So they're doing quite well. And then we're always thinking about ways we've talked to you guys in the past about how to commercialize our customer base further and how to drive more revenue. So more to come on that, but that's sort of generally the story.
David Katz: Understood. And I don't want to break the rules, but there was just one. SG&A came down a little bit, and I hope this is helpful to everyone. I was just curious what the driver of the SG& A guide coming in a little bit was and if it's sustainable in 2023, and then I'll stop. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, that's okay. We'll let you break the rules a little bit. Look, it's a fair question. I would say, generally, it's a really good story, right? I mean, we continue to do a good job of containing costs where as you know, we're very disciplined about spending money. There is a little bit of timing stuff in the GAAP numbers, and I know we give you the gap, and we think about it warrant cash, and it's a little bit unfair. There is a little bit of noise in the GAAP numbers, but it's still a really good story. There's still legit savings on the GAAP side. And then we think about it more on the cash side, right? What are we actually spending on overhead? And our cash G&A this year for the full year is going to be sort of down in the low to mid-teens relative to 2019. That's not to say there aren't some headwinds in terms of as the business recovers and people move around a little bit more, cost of labor, inflation is a real thing. But we still think that over time, we'll be able to grow our G& A base sort of around the level of inflation going forward. And so you'll see sort of permanent -- that's part of what's driving the margin improvements that Chris was talking about earlier in the call.
David Katz: Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead. 
Robin Farley: Great. Circling back to you having more rooms under construction than you did a quarter ago. I know you talked a bit about China and that starts are up there. Can you talk about what's going on with US rooms under construction? And it's just what we hear from others is that it's been so much more challenging to get developers to put shovels in the ground, right, outside of the signings, actually putting a shovel in the ground. And so is what you saw here in Q3 an anomaly in terms of having more refund construction sequentially, or is that something that you think you'll continue to see. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Well, we certainly hope we continue to see it. I mean, it is definitely an inflection point in the third quarter, which we think continues into the fourth quarter. While it's certainly relative to normal times, if there is such a thing, it's more difficult in terms of cost to build financing availability. The other thing that's happened is the recovery has been much, much steeper than anybody thought. And obviously, unlike any other recovery period, rate strength has way outperformed what anybody had thought. And when you look at it, you could look at the majority of our system, which we do, the majority of our system, the hotels are generating greater profitability than they ever have, greater than 2019, which was the prior high watermark. So, what is that -- what is happening? That is then fueling optimism. We'll talk about the US because you asked about the US, it's fueling optimism in people wanting to do more deals. This is -- we have a very diversified owner base. It's mostly small and medium businesses. This is what they do. It isn't a part of what they do. It's 100% for the most part of what they do, and they like what they see and they're making gobs of money in most of their hotels, and they want to do more of it, and they want to lock up the best brands to pat us on the back. We have the highest-performing brands in the business, the highest market share across on average and across each of the segments. And so we, I think, are disproportionately benefiting from that. And how it's showing up is, as Kevin, I think, mentioned in his prepared comments, we're going to be over 2019 levels on signings this year in the US. And that -- and a percentage of those are translating into starts, and that's why we have seen the uptick in starts starting in the third quarter that we think is going to continue in the fourth quarter. Now, there's a lot of uncertainty. I don't -- like how many different ways we can say it, and everybody is asking the question says it., So there's a lot of uncertainty out in the future, but we are seeing an inflection point. And we are certainly -- expect that to continue and are hopeful it continues for an extended period of time. While input costs are higher, the reality is those things are starting to stabilize a little bit. And you've seen other forms of construction drop off, which have provided more availability of subcontractors. And while the big banks are still -- it's still challenging from a lending point of view, our ownership community broadly is getting financed in local and regional banks, and they've still with the strongest relationships, been willing to finance. Now, they're putting more equity up, they're providing, in many cases, full recourse and rates are higher. But I think their view is rates are higher for a period of time. These are short-term financings that ultimately, when assets stabilize, will be in a different environment and longer they can convert to longer-term financing that's more reasonable. So, while it is clearly net-net harder, there are a lot of reasons. As I say, if you just look at the behavior of our broader owner community, they're signing more deals, and we've hit an inflection point on starts and we like seeing that. And we think our performance and market share and all of those things are meaningful contributors to it. And we'll keep you up to speed as we watch those tailwinds and headwinds in a macro environment to see if that changes, but we were -- we've been very pleased with that momentum.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you for the color. And just for my follow-up question, if I could ask about group. You mentioned your position for 2023 is 5% ahead of 2019. And I think that's a total revenue position. And just given how much disruption there's been that groups that were not necessarily booking as far out because of the disruption from the pandemic, it seems like, I'm just thinking about the impact on your RevPAR for next year, that the benefit to you is that if they're booking closer in, you're going to be able to get these, sort of, current rates as opposed to like historically group, you're stuck with whatever rates you agreed to two years ago. Can you give us a sense of maybe how much the volume is down? Like thinking about like the incremental price that you may get on. I don't know how significant that volume delta between now and what you have in 2019 one.
Chris Nassetta: Let me sync up on stats because I think maybe I misheard you, or you misstated what I said when I gave group stats. So we're 5% up in the fourth quarter. By the way, if you go back a couple of quarters ago, we were not. We were 5% or 10% down. So again, the business has been picking up at a very rapid pace, but it is relatively short lead. We are 9% or 10% often group position system-wide for 2023, not ahead. But our tentatives and pipeline are literally off the charts. I mean, when we sit here and talk to our sales teams, across the world, the biggest issue is just having enough people to keep up with all the demand. There's a massive amount of demand, and it is short lead demand. So when we look into next year, just given the experience we've been having, it makes us feel very, very good about being able to fill in that group base and ultimately get group back, which was that 93% in the third quarter. We think it will be, from a revenue point of view, roughly at par in the fourth quarter. And we think given this trajectory, it will be above 19 high watermarks next year. Thus, another contributor like leisure, which we think will stay strong, and business transient, which we think is picking up steam and will stay strong, to why we think next year will be a reasonably a very good positive year. In terms of rates -- that is a good thing in the sense that we do, I think, have a reason -- if all these segments stay stable to strong, we have an ability to maintain pricing power that I think is, again, just back to the fundamentals of the business that, I think, is reasonably good. And we've been booking new business at much higher rates. You're right, existing business is booked at less high rates, although still reasonable rates.  Most of those are equal to or greater than 2019 rates. And at this point, the majority of our bookings for all of next year, I would say, are still to be booked. We're probably roughly half of our bookings, maybe plus or minus, are on the books at this point in the year and everything that's going on between now and the end of the year, we will go into next year higher than that, in my opinion, given the demand. But all of those bookings will be at the higher rate structure. So we think there's both the opportunity for the demand to get back and then exceed base demand levels of 2019 and to do it at a higher rate, which, for that segment, will contribute meaningfully to RevPAR growth. Just to think back to what it normally was, our system-wide group was about 20% of our business in 2019. Right now, it's about 16%, 17%. So we think next year will normalize and be pretty close to, if not, at historical levels of demand from a segmentation point of view.
Robin Farley: Great. Super helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, you mentioned that one of the areas of the Q3 came from the better European ownership segment, which is probably benefiting from a stronger US dollar and just overall recovery. Can you talk about how you're thinking about this segment, the margins around that maybe in the fourth quarter and beyond? I know at the beginning of the year, there was probably a little bit more pessimism. And I'd say in the last two quarters, this has probably come in ahead of expectations and push numbers higher? Just trying to level set on that. Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, sure. I think, yeah, that's completely fair. I mean, I think that Europe has continued to despite what -- if you -- the rhetoric over there and what they're bracing for in the winter and things like that, we talked about all the time around here, the operating results have continued to defy gravity, and you heard the results that I've said in my prepared remarks, which are its growth in excess, both obviously on an absolute basis because of how far it fell, but relative to 2019 in excess of the other regions of the world. That clearly has translated through to our real estate portfolio or at least the part of it that is concentrated in that part of the world, the UK and Central Europe. I'd say for the fourth quarter, similar to what we've said about the macro, we don't see any reason to believe that won't continue. And then you probably, in that part of the world, have some headwinds next year. I mean, you think about the inflation that they've got going on, that affects labor, that affects, energy, costs and utilities and things like that, although the fundamental environment holds up, we should do just fine. And then Japan, where we have a couple of large leases, again, they just opened the country up, demand is starting to pour in, and that's a part of the portfolio that could be a headwind. And so I'd say to wrap it all up, on a run rate basis, we're about three quarters of the way back to 2019 levels. So we don't see any reason why that portfolio doesn't continue to recover to where it was, which should continue to enhance our growth rate broadly overall. And I think it's always worth mentioning that that, keep in mind that the rest of the business, the fee business is growing at a nice clip, and that portfolio continues to get smaller over time because of the work we've done there. So we exited seven leases last year. We'll exit another two or three of them this year. I think two or three a year is probably the right way to think about it. And that business will be -- you wake up a few years from now, that will be 5% or less of the overall business.
Chad Beynon: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Morning.
Patrick Scholes: I wonder if we could talk a little bit more about the group pace. If I got my numbers correct, you said next year down roughly 9% to 10%, and then you said for 4Q, up 5%. I wonder since you reported in the end of July, how is the pace been going for those two different periods? It certainly sounds like 4Q was up, but what was the comparable pace for next year when you last reported…?
Chris Nassetta: Best I remember, they both moved about 500 basis points in the quarter.
Q – Patrick Scholes: Correct.
A – Chris Nassetta: Up. Better. Better.
Q – Patrick Scholes: Okay. And then do you have any -- I know it's early, but any indications on sort of the longer -- how are corporations feeling about 2024, 2025 at this point? I guess, it's fair to assume that they are probably a lot more cautious than they would be to book a holiday party at this point?
A – Chris Nassetta: Yeah, I mean, that's not -- the business that gets booked that far out is typically the mega size groups. The association groups and other trade groups, and not so much -- I mean, corporations don't -- they don't book their small meetings or their social events. That's a relatively short cycle. But when you look at the big -- I think I mentioned -- I know I mentioned in my prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of the mix on a forward-looking basis in bookings on the group side is looking a lot like the mix from pre-COVID, which by definition means we're getting a much bigger mix of the very large meetings and events that are getting booked. It's not surprising. It took some time to get there. And to get the revenue consumed, we'll take more time because these are huge multi-thousand person events, many of them citywide. They just take a long time to plan and implement. But that is definitely starting to happen as you talk to convention, visitor, CVBs around the country that is starting to happen. And it makes sense. Notwithstanding the macro concerns out there, a lot of these groups have to meet to survive. I mean, these are events that it's not just networking, these are revenue raising events that allow these trade groups and associations to be alive. And so they can only go so long in not doing these. And the reason they weren't doing them before was -- and by the way, they're generally very resilient in economic ups and downs, the big mega groups that book multiyears out, because there's too much planning and money involved. The reason that they uniquely during COVID were impacted was health. Like nobody -- if you're having an event that nobody shows up, well then we'll pay the registration fee and then you have a big expense of putting on the event, you not only don't make money, you can lose a lot of money. But now that we're sort of like -- I don't want to be the guy that declares that COVID is sort of over in the sense that it's not gone and there's variance, people aren't making decisions in terms of their behavior, both personally and professionally. And in meetings and events that are factoring for that, I think all of these groups now view it as it's a safe time from a health point of view to do it and they need to do it. And so they're very deep into the booking and planning processes. And so it sort of makes sense. The unique thing was the health issue this time, which we had to sort of get through. But I think at this point, notwithstanding things going on in COVID, I mean, just go into the airport, go into any one of our big hotels or anywhere else, and you can see that when these events are happening, they're very normal. It looks just like it did before.
Q – Patrick Scholes: Okay. Chris, I appreciate the color. Thank you.
A – Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Q – Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks very much. Maybe switch gears a little bit. I wanted to ask you about revenue management systems. One of the things we've heard from operators recently is a preference for Hilton RM systems and the concept of pricing floors in those systems moving up. Can you speak to the investment you've made around RM? What do you think your special sauce is there and how you might be viewing pricing floors and institutionalizing those pricing floors differently than you have in the past?
Chris Nassetta: I'll let Kevin answer. But competitively, we're probably not going to give you quite a detailed answer that you want.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I was going to say that. But, yes, we probably won't get into the way the algorithms work or any -- I don't even know, I can't even bring myself to say that out loud. But, look, I'd say, we have a long history of being really good at revenue management. And it is part of our special sauce. We say all the time, you can't really unpack all of the different things that we do commercially and say it's that -- that one thing is x basis points of RevPAR index premium, right? It all goes into the premiums that we drive. But, I would say, we, in our history, we have a vendor that we work with. We co-created the algorithm with them. We work -- they've been an amazing partner. We work really hard with them. And we think we're really good at it. We've created the concept of the consolidated center. We drive more of our owners that sign up to be in these consolidated centers where we help them. We don't set pricing for the vast majority of our system, right, because 75% of it's franchise, and it's ultimately up to the franchisees to set the pricing. But we can advise them on how we do it, and we're really good at it and it's part of our special sauce, and I’d probably just leave it at that. I don't know got anything to add.
Chris Nassetta: And -- no, I would say, that's right. And we don't stop. I mean, it's not a system. In the old days, these systems are like, build a new system and then you let it run for a long time. We’re -- these algorithms are being tweaked constantly to add incremental data fields that used to be in revenue management in our world. It was really just like data related to the hotel. Now, we have data sets, because the world is awash in data that are contributing to the decision-making in these algorithms and just make it smarter. During COVID and the aftermath of COVID, one of the big things has not been less about floors and more about ceilings. And so, I think, we've been very thoughtful about that as well. So, yes, it's part of our -- one of the many things that we think we -- our commercial teams are second to none in the industry, not just in revenue management. But in every other regard, but this is one area that we think we do a really good job.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Next question is from Stephen Grambling from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks for taking my question. This is a bit of a follow-up on the last topic and on pricing power broadly. Prior to the pandemic, there were regular questions, it seemed on why rate was so hard to push even as occupancies were near peak. Given that there seems to be very little pricing pushback now, how would you frame what has changed cyclically versus structurally? Do you consider the changes in consumer behavior, distribution, yield management as you were describing or other factors? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Stephen, good to have you on the call. I mean, not to be pedantic about it, but maybe I'll sound that way. It's just the loss of economics. I mean, I don't know how many times I got asked in the lead up to the pandemic. Why can't you get rate pressure? I'm not going to accuse you of it, but probably got asked a thousand times by you and everybody else. And my comment there is just, there was no compression. You were in an environment where, while supply wasn't high, it was over 30-year averages, and more importantly, demand was low, because you were in this very low work growth environment where GDP was vacillating between like 0% and 2%. And you put those -- you were an equilibrium. I mean, supply and demand, or maybe even a little bit at an equilibrium in the wrong way, and that doesn't give you pricing power.
Kevin Jacobs: And no inflation.
Chris Nassetta: And no inflation. Now, you have all the things that allow you to have pricing power. You have very limited capacity for what will be an extended period of time, robust demand growth that we're talking about and broader inflationary pressures. And those things are different to the laws of economics. As they say around here, they're alive and well, and that's what's happening. They were driving the results prepandemic and they're driving this result just a different set of conditions.
Stephen Grambling: Makes sense. Thanks for getting me on. I’ll leave it with one.
Chris Nassetta: Sounds good.
Operator: The next question is from Brandt Montour from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Brandt Montour: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Chris or Kevin, I'm curious if you have thoughts about the conversion activity into a potential macro slowdown. And the basis for the question is that, that activity historically has acted sort of countercyclical for obvious reasons, but you guys just had a cycle where conversion activity was really high. So I guess, was there a pull forward of the conversion activity into 2020 and 2021 and 2022, that we would have maybe normally seen in a macro type of slowdown which we could eventually see?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I don't think -- it's a good question, Brandt. I don't think there's been a pull forward. I mean, we're still going to do roughly 25% of our rooms additions this year as conversions. You're right, that interestingly, it does tend to be countercyclical. And I think this is what you're saying, but I'll just say it anyway, look, sort of rising tide -- conversions actually get tougher in really strong fundamental environments, right? Rising tides lift all boats. And so, if you think of an independent hotel that may be considering needing a brand in a really strong demand environment, they need us a little bit less. And so the pace of convergence goes down. So that's actually a little bit, interestingly, a little bit of a headwind right now. And then the other thing that drives it is a lot of them happen around transactions, right? And at the moment, because of people thinking about macro headwinds going forward, transaction activity has slowed somewhat because bid-ask spreads have widened in those markets. And so there aren't as many assets trading. So that's a little bit of a headwind. And I think actually a downturn can sort of be a strong tailwind on both of those fronts, right? If you get a little bit of a reset in people's outlook, you sort of have a downturn, then the outlook gets better, capital costs sort of adjust, rates come down, spreads widen, you actually then see a pickup in transaction activity, which helps. And then during the downturn, as demand softens, people need us more. So, we think that conversions will continue to be a big part of the story. And interestingly enough, a little bit of a softening in the macro could be a nice tailwind there.
Brandt Montour: Makes sense. Thanks for all the thoughts.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
End of Q&A:
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time. As always, we appreciate the great questions and opportunity to give you a little bit of color on everything going on. Obviously, the macro environment is a little bit uncertain. And like you, we're watching it very carefully. But as you heard today, we remain really optimistic, certainly, about the long term of the business given the position that we're in from a brand strength and margin and overall enterprise-wide point of view. But we also remain optimistic in the short to medium term, just given that these tailwinds that we've talked about several times today are pretty strong. And we continue to see very good trends and very good recovery across all the segments. So we'll look forward after the end of the year to giving you a sense of the fourth quarter, and obviously, a little bit more visibility into how we think about 2023. Thanks again. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-07-27 10:30:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hiltonâs Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hiltonâs second quarter 2022 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K and first quarter 10-Q. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in todayâs call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the companyâs outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results and discuss expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our second quarter results demonstrate, we have a lot to be proud of. System-wide RevPAR achieved 98% of 2019 peak levels with all major regions except for Asia-Pacific, exceeding 2019 RevPAR. We continued to execute on our strong development story reaching 7,000 hotels globally and grew our industry-leading RevPAR premiums, all while maintaining good cost discipline. Coupled with the resiliency of our asset-light fee-based business model, these accomplishments enabled us to deliver EBITDA 10% higher than the second quarter of 2019, with margins of nearly 70%, up more than 800 basis points above 2019 levels. As a result, we continued returning meaningful capital to shareholders after resuming our capital return program last quarter. Turning specifically to results, we reported RevPAR adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high-end of our guidance for the second quarter. System-wide RevPAR increased 54% year-over-year and was just 2% below 2019 levels, improving each month throughout the quarter with June RevPAR surpassing prior peaks. All segments improved quarter-over-quarter led by business transient and group. Leisure transient trends remained robust as consumer spending continued to shift from goods to services, particularly travel and entertainment. Weekend RevPAR was up approximately 14% compared to 2019 driven by robust rate gains. In June, weekend ADR was up 20% versus prior peaks. Business transient demand continued to improve throughout the quarter, driving weekday occupancy up 6 points from April to June, weekday RevPAR was 95% of 2019 levels, with ADR exceeding prior peaks. U.S. business transient RevPAR surpassed prior peak levels in June with demand improving across nearly all industries. On the group side, RevPAR in the quarter was roughly 85% of 2019 levels. Full year group position improved meaningfully throughout the quarter with strong forward bookings across all location types and nearly all major categories. Group mix is beginning to normalize with the percentage of company meetings increasing. Bookings for company meetings strengthened each month of the quarter, with tentative pipeline for the year, up materially versus 2019 boosted by high-teens rate increases. In the U.S., total group position is nearly at prior peak levels for the third quarter and exceeds prior peaks for the fourth quarter. With continued improvement in these segments and positive momentum across all regions, we remain optimistic for continued recovery throughout the balance of the year. As a result, we are raising our expectations for the full year to reflect the quarterâs strong results and better anticipated trends in the back half with RevPAR surpassing 2019 levels. For the full year, we expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA above 2019 and to generate the highest level of free cash flow in our history. We expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends or approximately 5% of our market cap at the midpoint. Turning to unit growth, we continue to drive a disproportionate share of global development, with nearly 1 in every 5 rooms under construction around the world slated to join our system. Additionally, our development market share is more than 3x larger than our existing share meaningfully higher than our peers given our industry leading RevPAR premiums. This is reflected in the more than 14,000 rooms we opened in the quarter. We signed more than 23,000 rooms bringing our development pipeline to a record 413,000 rooms. With nearly half of our pipeline under construction, we remain on track to deliver approximately 5% net unit growth for the year. According to Star, our year-to-date net additions are higher than all major branded competitors. Our conversion openings totaled more than 3,400 rooms in the quarter, representing roughly 24% of total openings. One of the most notable conversion openings in the quarter was the Waldorf Astoria Washington D.C. inspired by the legacy of the Old Post Office Building. The property brings Waldorfâs iconic history, stunning design and unforgettable experience experiences to our nationâs capital. Our disciplined development strategy continues to enhance our network effect, enabling us to serve more guests across more destinations for any stay occasion. During the second quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 2,800th Hampton hotel, 60,000 embassy rooms and several key luxury announcements, including the openings of Conrad properties in Nashville and Sardinia, and the signings of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney and Waldorf Astoria Kuala Lumpur. Earlier this month, we celebrated the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Los Angeles, anchored within The Grand LA, the spectacular 305-room hotel marks the brandâs debut in California and makes LA the second U.S. city alongside Las Vegas to feature all three of our luxury brands. The openings of the Hilton Maldives Amingiri Resort & Spa and the Hilton Tulum Riviera Maya, an all-inclusive resort were two of the latest additions to our rapidly expanding portfolio of resort properties in prime beachfront destinations. With 400 unique hotels and resorts open and in the pipeline, our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry, continue to provide an attractive value proposition for owners. By providing authentic and curated experiences and drawing inspiration from their local communities, these brands enable owners to retain their own unique identities while also benefiting from the power of our commercial engines. During the quarter, we opened the Royal Palm Galapagos marking the first international hotel brand in the Galapagos Islands and making Ecuador the 30th country in Curioâs growing portfolio. Tapestry opened its 10,000th room in the quarter, including the Hotel Marcel New Haven, which is anticipated to be the first net-zero hotel in the U.S. and one of less than a dozen LEED Platinum certified hotels in the country. All of these openings continue to expand the offerings available to our Hilton Honors members. In the quarter, Honors membership grew 17% to 139 million members and accounted for approximately 62% of occupancy, up 350 basis points year-over-year and roughly in line with 2019. To address the evolving needs of guests who want to travel with their pets, we have expanded our partnership with Mars Petcare to now include 7 of our brands, including all our focus service and All Suites Brands as well as Canopy. Through these expanded partnerships, guests will have access to virtual support from the Mars Pet expert team and have more than 4,600 pet friendly hotels to choose from. We continue to double down on the importance of the guest experience and their stay. Earlier this week, we launched our first ever global platform to focus on what has been missing from hotel advertising, the Stay. Hilton For the Stay places the hotel front and center. It goes without saying that our team members continue to be at the heart of that stay experience. I am extremely proud that earlier in the quarter, Hilton was inducted in DiversityInc.âs Hall of Fame for our continued commitment to building an inclusive and welcoming environment. And now, I will turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the quarter and the expectations for the rest of the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 54.3% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 2.1% compared to 2019. Growth was driven by continued strength in leisure demand through the start of the summer travel season as well as stronger than expected recovery in business transient and group travel. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $679 million in the second quarter exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and up to 70% year-over-year. Outperformance was driven by better than expected fee growth, particularly across the Americas and EMEA regions. Management and franchise fees grew 54% driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Cost control further benefited results. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items, was $1.29 exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and increasing 130% year-over-year. Turning to our regional performance, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 47% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance continued to be led by robust leisure trends and was further boosted by significant RevPAR recovery in business transient group, up 16 and 20 percentage points respectively from the first quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 140% year-over-year and was up nearly 5% versus 2019. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties. In Europe, RevPAR grew 283% year-over-year and was up 1% versus 2019. Performance benefited from reduced travel restrictions and greater than expected international inbound arrivals. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 68% year-over-year and was up 4% versus 2019. The region continued to benefit from robust domestic leisure demand and strong international inbound travel, particularly from Europe. In the Asia-Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR was down 5% year-over-year and down 39% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 47% compared to 2019 as strict COVID policies and lockdowns in Shanghai and Beijing continue to weigh on travel demand early in the quarter. Demand recovered quickly once restrictions eased, with occupancy in China recovering from 37% in April to approximately 60% in June, less than 6 points shy of 2019 levels. The rest of the Asia-Pacific region saw improvement as countries outside of China benefited from border reopenings. RevPAR for Asia-Pacific ex-China improved 12 percentage points throughout the second quarter, with April down 29% versus 2019 and June down 17%. We remain optimistic about continued recovery across the entire APAC region, including China as COVID-related policies continued to ease and additional countries opened their borders for international travel. Turning to development, our pipeline grew year-over-year and sequentially totaling over 413,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. While macroeconomic uncertainty and variability across regions persist, owner and development â owner and developer interest remains healthy. The development community continues to preference our industry leading brands and strong commercial engines. For the full year, we still expect net unit growth of approximately 5% and signings to exceed 100,000 rooms. Moving to guidance, for the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 25% and 30% year-over-year year or up 1% to 5% compared to third quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $660 million and $690 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $1.16 and $1.24. For full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 37% and 43%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR to be down 1% to 5%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, with margins for the full year more than 600 basis points higher than 2019 levels. Our adjusted EBITDA forecast represents a year-over-year increase of more than 50% at the midpoint and exceeds 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $4.21 and $4.46. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $41 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $800 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak to all of you this morning. So, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Thank you.  And our first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris, Kevin, Jill, everyone. Chris, maybe this one is best for you. Just in terms of how you are thinking about the rest of the year? What is it that that you guys see here at the end of July? I am sure you have a pretty good look in August, but clearly, the September-October busier business travel season, group season, etcetera, what is it that you see in this period that kind of gives you the confidence in the guidance raise for the rest of the year and how do you kind of think about or feel when you look out to 2023?
Chris Nassetta: Carlo thanks for the question. That obviously is the prime question, I think on everybodyâs mind. And I think it would be â it would be sort of best to start by saying, as everybody on this call knows that there is certainly a lot of uncertainty in the world. And I think we have to sort of be mindful of that as everybody has. I mean, we have been, as much as we see whatâs going on and we are watching the broader environment and lots of talk of slowdown and seeing it in certain industries. Certainly, I think predominantly industries that had reached high watermarks that were had favorable impacts from COVID, but nonetheless, starting to see slowdown. We have been looking very carefully at our business as you would guess that all the segments that sort of any forward-looking trends that we can see. And I would say, what we are seeing still is very positive. We see as Kevin and I both said in our prepared comments, continued strength in leisure, we expect to see that continue into the fall and higher rates than normal, I mean, lower rates than summer, like always, but higher rates than you would have typically seen pre-COVID, just because of increased leisure business, business transient continues to recover, led by recovery in the big corporates, which are not back to where they are, but they are back to sort of 80% of where they were. And the SMB side of the business that has been quite robust. I mean, in the second half of the year, based on the trends we have been seeing, our expectation is business transient is going to be sort of on a revenue basis equal to 2019 levels. And then when we think about the group side, while we donât think in the second half, we will get all the way back to where we were â19, we are going to get awfully close. And as I said, in my prepared comments, if we look at the booking position in third and fourth quarter, second half of the year, itâs over â19 levels and our sales teams tell â keep telling me, they can hardly keep up with the demand. Now, reality is, again, we are in an uncertain world. The booking windows are short. So our visibility is limited, certainly on transient business. We canât really look too deeply into the fall on transient. Again, we can on the group side and those stats are good, but the current trajectory is good looking at July. June as we said was over â19 levels. July is trending in a very good way and it will be over â19 and improve over and above what we saw in June. So everything we are seeing sort of real-time, everything we have in terms of sightlines into the future, all feel pretty good, recognizing itâs â there is a lot of macro uncertainty and recognizing that our booking windows and sightlines are not that far out, I think what is causing it like sort of as you see other industries sort of being impacted everyday, including today is a big reporting day, again, I think a lot of what you see coming, sort of going the wrong way are industries that were at crazy peaks, because they were huge beneficiaries, many of them of COVID and the pandemic, we were obviously not a big beneficiary. I think thatâs a fairly nice way of putting it. And our industry got hammered. And so what we are benefiting from, I think is sort of a handful of things. One, there is a lot of pent-up demand. We hear it all the time. I mean, while I donât have tremendous sightlines in the sense of real transient booking data to give you, just because it doesnât exist, we talked to our customers all the time, not just the group customers, we are talking to all of our customers and we are in a regular dialogue with our SMBs, with the big corporates. And the anecdotal feedback that we are getting as we go into the fall is people have to travel more, more offices are open, more people are back in the office, while people are worried about where the macro environment is going. They have got to run the businesses. And in fact, the more worried they are, the more they realize they sort of got to get out there and make sure they are hustling. So, there is an element of pent-up demand. There is clearly and Iâm not going to say I was right, but Iâve been right, there is clearly a massive shift in spending patterns right, away from goods into services. I said in my prepared comments, I have been saying since the beginning of the pandemic that the world is not going to go upside down that it may go upside down for a while, but it will normalize and thatâs exactly what we are seeing. And so not only do you have pent-up demand, you just have new demand thatâs coming as people are sort of shifting their spending patterns. That means leisure business group, their people are shifting back to a more normalized lifestyle. Maybe itâs not exactly the way it was, but itâs more like it was than it was. Itâs more like it was pre-COVID than it is during COVID. And so we are the beneficiary that you have. Infrastructure, people donât talk about it. We passed a nearly $1 trillion infrastructure package last year. Very little of that has been spent traditionally. You would start to see spending in the second, third and fourth year. So we are just sort of coming into the zone over the next 2 or 3 years on a $1 trillion of spending. I have said this so many times you guys are tired of hearing it. The highest R-squared correlation to demand growth in hotel rooms is NRFI, Non-Residential Fixed Investment, AKA Infrastructure. So I think â we think we feel good about sort of that being sort of underpinning broadly, Asia recovery, Kevin talked about it. Asia has been way behind. Itâs not recovering as quickly as we would have thought, particularly China, but I do â but it is recovering. And I think that provides some benefits, not just the rest of this year, but into next year. And then probably last but not least, if we look at our customers, certainly like our Honors base, which are driving the disproportionate share of our system-wide revenues. At the moment, they are still in pretty good shape. I mean, the median income of our higher end Honors members is significantly over $100,000 median income. And so, at the moment, they are still in pretty good shape and we havenât really yet seen any real cracks in the armor in terms of their spending pattern. So, I know thatâs a filibuster of sorts, but I think it gives â to answer the question, it gives you color, but as we sat in the very room, we are sitting in and thought about, how do we feel about the rest of this year? Thatâs how we sort of â thatâs how we came up with our forecast in our outlook. And as we think about next year, listen Iâd be silly to say, I know, because nobody knows this. We are in pretty much uncharted waters as the smartest economist I talked to or saying the same thing. So I donât know. But I think a bunch of those things that I described are pretty good wind in our sails against what is obviously going to be a slowing U.S. and global economy, because thatâs what central banks are going to do. But we have some things that I think sort of our winds blowing the other way. And so I think as we get into the first half of next year, we are feeling like that, that is going to be helpful to us how we think the whole year will play out. Obviously, itâs premature for us to judge and when we get a little bit closer to it, we will have a little bit more precise view.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Chris, thatâs very helpful. And then I want to be courteous to everyone on the call, but just quickly to clarify some of the comments from earlier, as you guys talked about, group and 4Q being greater or being up year-over-year, I should say, was that a revenue position comment you were makingâ¦
Chris Nassetta: Revenue, revenue, revenueâ¦
Carlo Santarelli: Could you talk about from an occupancy or occupied room night perspective, how group compares?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I think system-wide second half of the year, we think it will be in the 90s. It will probably be 5 points off with the difference being made up in rate.
Carlo Santarelli: Got it. Thank you, sir. Take care.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Sean Kelly from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Sean Kelly: Hey, good morning, everyone. Chris, maybe just to dig in, I mean, obviously, you covered sort of most of the subjects in that last answer. So maybe to go slightly or deeper, if we just think about the acceleration between kind of what you are implying for the third quarter and what you actually saw in the second, what are some of the biggest, variances they are going to drive that things that come to mind are obviously international and then the continued improvement, you probably saw sequentially on business transient, but could you help unpack that a little bit?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, sorry, I did give a bit of a filibuster, but just wanted to give the whole thing context and not have it be chopped up. So, my apologies for answering what are probably a bunch of your questions, but I do think I sort of covered that. We certainly expect international travel to pick up. We donât think thatâs going to move the needle in necessarily in a huge way in the second half of the year. It really is what we described is what I already described, which is continuing strength and leisure, because weekend business we think is still going to remain strong, consumers still has desire and capacity to do it. They are traveling more from combination of the leisure business, of business in leisure. So we think that will mean leisure business will ultimately be at elevated levels relative to what we saw in pre-pandemic times. And we do think from a revenue point of view, business transient is on track largely because of the success we have had in SMB in the second half of the year, just on a revenue basis be back to 2019 levels. Now, that depends â we donât have all those bookings on that are confirmed at this point, but if you look again at June and July, you talk to the customers, look â we look at detailed data on sort of how they are behaving right now. We feel good about that and group I covered. I mean, we think group will not recover to where we were in â19. There is just not enough time, but we think itâs going to get awfully close. And we think there is a lot of momentum in the group side going into next year. So, I think, net-net, Sean, probably repeating myself, what it depends on is more of what we have been saying just grinding up on business. I mean, we are at â for the whole quarter, we were at 95% on business transient. So we are getting awfully close in June in the U.S. We hit â19 level. So it doesnât â the rest of the year. It doesnât â itâs sort of â it â what the rest of the year suggests is the strengthening and group based on our real position of group room nights on the books. And similar to what we have seen in June and July, in business transient and normal â strength on weekends for leisure, but normal pattern of leisure backing off during the midweek as you go into the fall.
Sean Kelly: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning, everybody.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Jeff.
Joe Greff: If you go back and you look at the last 2.5 years itâs been remarkable that your same-store RevPAR growth rate and your management and franchise fee growth rate have mirrored each other almost to a one-to-one relationship. And over that timeframe, you have grown your room count north of 10%. The relationship between RevPAR growth and say fee growth or that sensitivity change going forward, where maybe there is if RevPAR were to experience a decline that sensitivity to the downside is maybe more favorable than what it would have been the last couple of years, just because of the growth in the room count?
Chris Nassetta: I think the â well, I think the answer is yes. And what largely would drive it is what you are saying the non-RevPAR related fees are growing as a percentage of the fee base. And then the impact on the downside was accentuated because of the extremes. So in a normal like sort of normal recessionary environment, you donât see those sort of extreme impacts in terms of declines, RevPAR to EBITDA. So we think in a normal kind of environment, yes, it would be more one for one and we would get the benefit of the things that you described.
Joe Greff: Great, thank you.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just touch on the owned and leased portion of the model, which I think swung to positive. This quarter was a little earlier than what we anticipated. Can you just talk about whatâs driving that? Is there a strong business component to that and give us some help with the rest of the year and sort of whatâs in there and how we might think about that?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, David. I think that we look first of all, I would say, yes, you are right, it did swing to a profit. We have been saying for a while that the growth rate would be more than the overall portfolio. In fact, that was the case when the numbers were still negative. It was in a weird way, it was still growing faster in improving the growth rate of the company. Itâs all fundamentals though. I mean, if you look at where the portfolio was located in this particular quarter, the real strength regions were UK, particularly London and Central Europe. Japan, still a little bit further behind. So as APAC recovers, you have even a little bit more of a tailwind there from that part of the portfolio, but the RevPAR growth in the quarter was significantly ahead of even where I gave the Europe the EMEA â I gave the Europe number in my prepared remarks. The RevPAR for this portfolio was even further ahead of that. And so thatâs where itâs coming from. And we expect those trends to continue again particularly as Japan is a little bit further behind on recovery. So, we expect going forward that, that portfolio. Well, remember, itâs a small part of the business. And over time, it will continue to be a smaller part of the business, but it will be a tailwind to our growth rate for a while as those regions recover.
David Katz: Can â if I may, not to overstate my welcome, but should we perhaps look at the â19 levels or any past levels of profitability and how might those guide us as we think about the future?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think itâs there is no reason why it wonât get back to or even exceed prior levels. You got to remember, the portfolio does get a little bit smaller over time. We exited 7 of those assets last year, 3 of which came into the system and shifted over to paying fees, but 4 of which went away altogether. Thatâs not going to make a huge difference on that. But I would â so I would say keeping in mind that the portfolio continues to get smaller, I would say that recovering to where it was on a lag is a good way to think about it.
David Katz: Excellent. Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you just a little bit on the pipeline, you continue to see sequential growth in there and significant signings and it just seems a little bit kind of lot of crosscurrents going on keep hearing about developer challenges. And I am just wondering if you could speak to where you are seeing the growth, I know you have spoken about China, but how is it looking in the U.S. and what sort of challenges maybe your developers facing and is Hilton helping at all in terms of loans or anything of that sort?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, really good question. And yes, I mean, whatâs going on, essentially and let me just sort of everywhere, but China is that demand on the â from owners to sign new deals, has actually moved up pretty nicely. And you would say why with all the swirling winds and all the uncertainty? Well, I mean, look at, like they own assets and they are at, look at the results we are delivering and what we think we will deliver for the year and where we are relative to â19. You think about margins, not our margins, but with all the changes we have made in the hotels. I mean, the reality is not every single â in every single case, but in many, many cases, the hotels that our owners own are performing extraordinarily well, they are at high RevPARs with higher margins than they had pre-COVID. And so listen, this is what they do for a living, they are seeing great success, they are seeing tremendous flow-through they are seeing incredible rate in sort of pressure and that makes them want to do more of what they do. And so as Kevin said, we will sign â we wonât get to our peak in signings, but we will get â we are getting closer. We will get over 100,000 rooms. And again, I think itâs just positive. So thatâs without China. China, actually, we will open more rooms in China this year, but we wonât sign as many simply, because there â with the way they are addressing COVID with the lockdowns and the likes, have slowed development activity there. We have every confidence that when they reopen, it will pick up at a fast pace, but from a cultural point of view, they really â you really donât get signings done when things are closed. Itâs just not the way things happen and itâs been a little delayed. So, I think the reality is when you â with the demand in the rest of the world, when you get that part of the engine firing as well, the numbers are going to feel pretty good and then it has to translate. And I think that will translate over time as sort of the world settles down a bit and people have a little bit more visibility on whatâs going on. But the demand is there market share, I shouldnât, we are not going to be â we are out of the business of describing exactly what our market share is for a whole bunch of competitive reasons. But I will say, market share is up, again, in a meaningful way, significantly above 2019 levels significantly above where all our competitors are and thatâs helping drive disproportionate interest, not only do people want to build more, but I think they want to â I think they want to build more with us, because we are doing a better job in terms of driving share to help them drive profitability.
Smedes Rose: Thanks. And letâs just quickly you guys are announcing a new ad campaign with a different kind of focus, but I was just wondering I should know this, but itâs not essentially supported by or funded by owners or is there corporate implications as well for that?
Chris Nassetta: That is funded by the system, which means essentially, itâs funded by owners. We have, I mean, the grossly simplified explanation is people will either pay us a management fee or franchise fee and then we have corporate expenses and then they pay system fees for a bunch of things marketing, technology, brand, essentially system charges and those that we manage, on a dollar â on a not for profit basis, if you will, on their behalf. And all of the marketing dollars that we are talking about in our campaign come out of that. They are not corporate dollars. They are for the benefit of the system.
Smedes Rose: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.
Operator: Yes. And the next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great, thanks. Just one follow-up on your comments on the demand from owners and kind of the record level of signings, some others in the industry have talked about getting record signings, but that construction starts have been matching the signings. And I know your rooms under construction currently are ahead of 2018, which is a great achievement. I am wondering if you are seeing though new rooms starts which would not impact your unit growth this year, but might have implications for â23 or â24, just kind of what you are seeing on the construction start front? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, happy to answer that. And then Kevin can jump in if he wants to add anything. First of all, just to be clear, I didnât say we are hitting records on signings, Iâd say we are over 100,000. I think our peak was 116 â 115, 116, something like that. So we are getting closer and we are getting over 100 without as much help as we would like from China. On the start side, we do believe starts will go down again this year, given all of the things that are going on in the world with supply chain labor, financial markets, fears over the macro and recession, we think that they will have down. Having said that, our best estimates at this point, we have talked about this on prior calls is that we will probably have hit the floor in starts in the U.S. last year. We think we will be up modestly this year and probably hit the floor outside the U.S. this year. And our expectation is, given what I described before in terms of just where we are with RevPAR, where we are with margins, owner desire to do things that all things being equal, we are of the mind that next year â that this year would be the low point in starts and that they would start moving back up. And that puts us in a position to do as we have been expecting and suggesting we would do, which is for the next couple of years deliver in the mid-single digit.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up on the margin performance, up 600 basis points, I think that you have guided before that you would hold on to 400 basis points of that, do you think itâs looking like you are at the higher end or maybe even above that at this point?
Chris Nassetta: We are doing better on margins, faster recovery, even better cost discipline that we assume. So, we are doing better on margins than we had suggested before.
Robin Farley: In terms of holding on to that into 2023?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. And we â actually, if you recall, we thought just because of the recovery in the real estate, we will get lower margins, it would help EBITDA growth, but it might just the arithmetic would hurt margins. And we had thought that we might sort of be flat or even a little bit down as we got through that this year. Obviously, with the guidance we gave you were 100 basis points, 150 basis points above what we did last year, which was meaningfully above â19, which is getting us to the higher end of the 600 basis points. And we think we are going to be able to continue to drive margin growth from there.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think last thing that Chris said is important in the sense that when we gave you that number that was sort of just helping people model sort of recovery and where it was going to go. It was not meant to be sort of a stopping point between the mix continuing to grow over time towards these non-RevPAR driven fees and cost control, we think margins will continue to grow over time.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. On average, if you just do the math and your model, my guess is it will be similar to ours. Itâs 50 basis point to 100 basis point natural accretion in margin every year, just based on the business model.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just may be sort of I am picking it a bit too much here. But if I look at your sort of Q3 and then your full year RevPAR guidance and maybe some of your commentary, it looks to me you are sort of saying the Q3 is going to be better than Q2. And then maybe Q4 will be a slight pullback, that you are only expecting leisure demand sort of run through the full and obviously with group being stronger in Q4, are you expecting some elements maybe just to step back a little bit in Q4, or am I reading a little bit too much into your guidance?
Chris Nassetta: I think you are reading a little too much into it. But I think at this point, we sort of view the second half of the year, third quarter and fourth quarter in a very similar way. Obviously, the third quarter is a much, much bigger, more important quarter in the sense of all forms of travel. So, you have sort of seasonal things going on. But in terms of the basic breakdown of what we think in performance of the segments, we donât â we are not forecasting any difference any meaningfulâ¦
Richard Clarke: Thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question. I think in the full year results, you specifically sort of guided, you are hoping for 66,000 construction starts this year. I think you gave a number in response to that. Is that still what you are looking to get to this year?
Kevin Jacobs: No, I think we had said that in the past and on prior calls. I think Chris said we expect starts to be down a little bit this year, there is a lot of year left. So, we are not sure exactly where itâs going to play out, but probably be a little bit less than that.
Richard Clarke: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. When you think about some of the restrictions with flight capacity that we hear about in the U.S. and in Europe not being able to keep up with consumer demand, do you believe any of this presents a risk to any parts of your recovery, or is it negligible and just more of kind of a soundbite for the airline industry?
Chris Nassetta: We have been watching that as you would guess really carefully and studying our data, along with the airline data and we havenât seen any real impact. We just canât find it. So, we feel pretty good about it. I mean talking to the not just listening, but I know most of the CEOs in the airline space and talking to them, I think they are making pretty darn good progress in terms of getting capacity back, getting the teams that they need in terms of pilots, flight attendants, maintenance crew, getting them trained. So, I mean itâs not done by any means. But I think every day, it gets a little better. And so I think we feel like, we will be fine. I mean if you look at the patterns, like in the in the second quarter, I was actually surprised. And itâs directional, I canât â I am not going to tell you like we have perfect data on this. But itâs pretty good directional, and itâs consistent with what âthe same way we would have analyzed it pre-COVID. In a normal world, like 60% of our business was fly-to and 40% of it was drive-to. In the second quarter, we think it was two-thirds drive-to, one-third fly-to. So, part of whatâs going on is people are with restricted capacities, they are just driving more, they are driving longer distances, but â and they are staying in a tighter â they may be driving further, but they are not going cross country or whatever. Itâs more regional and local business, but that works. So at the moment, while the airlines are sort of working their issues out, I think people are acting sort of accordingly in terms of how they are getting places. And we are not seeing any impact. We donât talk to customers, we donât think that itâs going to impair the rest of the year.
Chad Beynon: Thanks Chris. Appreciate it.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: And the next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am curious how you are thinking about planning the business over the course of the next 12 months. It clearly sounds like the trend lines in corporate and group are getting better. Obviously, you believe leisure is continuing to fetch healthy ADRs and remain pretty stable at the high levels. As you think about like an efficient mix within those three buckets of demand, how are you approaching that and how are you handling pricing out the corporate and the group business as it comes back?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean the truth is, we are doing it with a lot of flexibility, because while we have a belief, which we have articulated in a bunch of different ways on this call, we know that we may not be perfectly right. So, as we â I think proven during COVID, our teams, including our sales teams, our commercial teams are unbelievably quick on their feet. We retooled everything when we had to in COVID. We have retooled a dozen times through COVID as demand patterns have sort of been normalizing. So, I think what we will be set up for and then ready to pivot is a world that I described, which is a world that is getting reasonably close to pre-COVID normalization. I mean just like in Q2, by way of example, if you look at the segments compared to 2019, 55% â in 2019, 55% of our overall system revenue came from business transient, 25% from leisure transient and 20% from group. If you look at the depths of COVID, it probably the most extreme times it went to like 35%, business, 55% leisure, and 10% group. In the second quarter, it was almost 50% business transient. It was like 34%, 35% leisure and 16% or 17% group. So as I have said before, we have sort of expected that as much as everybody wants to think everything is different. We sort of have been planning throughout and taking it in steps for a normalization to maybe not be exactly where we were pre-pandemic, but more looking like that than where we were, and thatâs whatâs happening. And so, thatâs what will be set up for. But as I have said, the key here always is, flexibility and be prepared to pivot. On the margin, I do think we will continue to have higher levels of leisure than we had pre-pandemic. My guess is we will have potentially a surge in group just because of so much pent up demand as well. And so what are we doing, we are making sure we are staying super aggressive on leisure strategies, making sure that we are staying super aggressive on â with our group sales team, and they were all over every opportunity. And that we are focused on that. And then on the business transient side, while we love our big corporates, and we continue to work with them, we have had a lot of success with the SMBs. In the end, we think that when we normalize, we will have lower big corporates and higher SMB at a higher rate. And so we have deployed accordingly in our sales teams across the board to make sure that we are working those SMB accounts that we are covering a lot more of those in a very thoughtful way to continue to build that business. So, those will be at a high level, thatâs sort of when we are sitting at this table talking about how we are going to deploy over the next 12 months, thatâs how we are thinking about it. But if the world pivots, we will pivot very quickly with it. But my guess is, thatâs how the world is going to play out, little bit more leisure, a lot more group, a bunch more business transient and for us with a with a real focus on the SMBs.
Vince Ciepiel: Thatâs helpful high level color there. And maybe just a little bit more specifically, on that larger corporate, I would imagine a lot of that falls under the corporate negotiated rates. Can you remind us where those have been through COVID? Are they flattish with â19 levels?
Chris Nassetta: They have been flat. They have been almost â all of our large corporate clients during COVID agreed to keep rates flat to 2019 levels. And now in those negotiations, again, keeping it in perspective, itâs like 7% of the business right now, maybe 7% and a little bit of change. So, like, just keep that in perspective. But I think, what we are indicating is probably mid-single digit kind of increases for those accounts. And again, in a lot of hotels, the reason we want that even though SMB is maybe at higher rate is it provides a base of business, just like we put a basic group business on the books. Itâs another way to put a base of business on. So, itâs hotel â it will be hotel-by-hotel, will be some hotels, and we will take any of it with some hotels, it will take some of it because they need the base. But I would suspect while itâs way early to judge, itâs sort of mid-single digit, the goals would be, to have dynamic pricing with all those accounts and that the end result will be somewhere in the mid-single digits. And that, when we are all said and done, it will be 6% or 7% â 6% to 8% of the business, where it used to be 10%.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Kind of following up on that question on corporate rates, we are starting to get into negotiation season and I know, you are like, tell me, if you are going to see corporate rates up 50% next year, but how do you think about group and corporate rates increasing next year as it relates to negotiated rates? And as I keep that in mind with inflation next year, probably 20% higher than where it was in 2019.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean â itâs hard to say and we are not here giving guidance on next year. There is a long way, if you are there and there is a lot of uncertainty in the world. But I mean probably the best, I gave you a little bit is said, although we are not in those negotiations in earnest yet with the big corporates where that would be. I think the way we would think about â the way we would think about unmanaged business transient business would be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range to keep pace with inflation. And I think we would think about the group, our group bookings the same way. In fact all the group bookings that like we were doing generally new group bookings that we did in the second quarter for â23, we are in the high-single digit rate increases, I mean as the data point.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. And thoughts on Airbnb supply, certainly we are seeing in some of those really hot leisure markets, whether itâs Vail, Aspen, Miami, a ton of Airbnb supply with everybody realizing how high the room rates are that they are going to rent out their units some, what sort of impact are you seeing, if any in those markets?
Chris Nassetta: None. Now, in some of those markets, we may not be in them. But as you can see kind of the numbers that we are posting at least what we are forecasting, what we are seeing in booking patterns, we are not seeing any impact. I mean I think what they do is they serve a certain customer need and we serve another customer need. I have said it for a long time, there is plenty of room for us to coexist given what we are delivering is very different. And itâs generally for different types of stay occasions. So, we are not â there is zero discernible impact from Airbnb side.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color.
Operator: And the next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks for the time. Maybe a short-term and a longer term, short-term, which international geographies surprised you the most in 2Q? And then longer term, how do you think about the pacing of China reopen 2023 and beyond, what is your planning assumption at this point?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I will offer an answer. Maybe Kevin will come over and offer a different one. But I would say Europe was the big surprise for me. Europe is on fire, huge surge in business. I mean the big cities, London, everything are raging this summer. In Q2 and they are raging in Q3. So, thatâs been and Europe is now trending above â19. I think for the full year, Europe will be not just for the second half, Europe was above in Q2. I think Europe will be ahead for the full year of 2019, in terms of RevPAR. So, thatâs been a pleasant surprise. And China, the honest answer is we donât know. I would have thought, I mean we are making progress. Kevin gave the data points. I mean we have moved from in the 30s to 60. And I think we are probably above that now. You have things ebbing and flowing. I saw this morning they are locking down part of Wuhan, a million people. So, we are hopeful by the â and I have been saying this, and I have been consistent by the time they have the party congress, which is in October, that they are at a different place. I think that is, as we talk to our teams there, I think there is a lot of belief that, as we get to the fall, things are going to normalize rapidly there. I do think it will be a while and what do I know for the record for anybody listening, I do think it will be a while before we have a ton of Chinese travelers traveling internationally or any of us going to China. I am hopeful that that would be next year. I havenât been since 2000 â the end of 2019 and I am dying to go. But the reality is, as we saw in the early recovery of COVID where they lead the world, when China opens up, China, in China, for China, just Chinese travelers moving around China, the business can boom in a very big way, because they are not leaving, they are staying and they love to travel within China and see the destinations there. So, I think as we get into October and the rest of the year, I would hope and I do think and our teams think that you are going to see a lot of activity in terms of whatâs going on and opening and travel within China. And I do think that will then start to restart in a big way the development engine that wants to go and people want to do, itâs just, itâs been kind of hard to get it chugging again.
Duane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: As always, we appreciate you guys taking an hour out of your life to join us. We are obviously really pleased with the results in second quarter. We see the recovery, not just to happening, but happening at an even faster pace than we thought. We know the world has got a lot going on, but as I have said, bunch of different ways. As to Kevin, we feel quite good. We are cautiously optimistic. We feel quite good about the momentum we have and the wind we have in our sales through the rest of this year and into the first part of next year. And we look forward to giving you an update after we finish the third quarter. Thanks and have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending todayâs presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-05-03 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. . Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.  Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results and discuss our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a minute to express our sadness at the tragic events continuing to unfold in Ukraine. Our hotels have always been a part of the fabric of the communities we serve, and we take our promise to make those communities better places to live and work very seriously. Along with the steps we've taken to protect our team members and guests, we've also partnered with American Express and our ownership community to donate up to 1 million room nights across Europe to support Ukrainian refugees and humanitarian relief efforts. Additionally, the Hilton Global Foundation has contributed to World Central Kitchen and Project Hope to further assist with the humanitarian aid. We are keeping our Hilton family and everyone impacted by these horrific events in our thoughts and hope for a peaceful resolution to this crisis. Our Hilton values and purpose-led culture have led us through uncertainty as well as recovery. Our team members around the world have worked hard to effectively navigate the challenges over the last 2 years, and as a result, have positioned Hilton even stronger for the future. As we look to the year ahead, we are optimistic that our industry-leading RevPAR premiums and fee-based capital-light business model, coupled with further demand recovery, will continue to drive strong performance and meaningful free cash flow, which will enable us to return significant capital to shareholders in a disciplined way. With recent performance exceeding our expectation, we were pleased to have resumed our Capital Return Program earlier than anticipated, beginning share repurchases in March. Through April, we had completed approximately $265 million of buybacks. Additionally, we have declared a $0.15 per share quarterly dividend, further highlighting the confidence in continued recovery and the strength of our model. For the year, we expect to return $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Turning to results in the quarter, system-wide RevPAR increased more than 80% year-over-year, driving adjusted EBITDA up 126%. RevPAR was approximately 83% of 2019 levels with adjusted EBITDA at 90%. Despite a choppy start to the year given Omicron related demand pressures, trends picked up meaningfully month-over-month with RevPAR declines versus 2019 improving approximately 17 percentage points from January to March, down only 9% to 2019, driven by acceleration across all segments. In March, system-wide rates were up 3% compared to 2019. Strong leisure transient trends continued to boost weekend performance with RevPAR in the quarter exceeding 2019 levels and rates up approximately 9% versus prior peaks, acceleration in business transient and group trends drove meaningful improvement midweek. U.S. business transient RevPAR increased sequentially versus the fourth quarter, with March down only 9% compared to 2019 levels. Improving trends from large accounts, along with continued strength from SMEs results. In March, revenue from large accounts was just 12% below 2019. Overall business transient now comprises 45% of total segment mix just 10-point shy of prepandemic levels. For April, overall U.S. transient booked revenue for all future periods was up 17% versus 2019 levels, with rates up 10% and room nights up 7%. Weekday booked revenue was up 9% compared to 2019 and weekend booked revenue was up 38%, driven largely by strong rate gains. On the group side, social and smaller events continue to lead recovery, while demand for company meetings and conventions improved meaningfully throughout the quarter. In March, total group RevPAR was more than 75% of 2019 levels, improving approximately 25 points versus January. Additionally, group revenue booked in the first quarter for all future periods was down just 4% relative to 2019 levels, and total lead volume for all future periods was up 3.5%. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue is up significantly with rate gains for company meetings up more than 13%. Additionally, rates on new group bookings for in-year arrivals are strong, up in the high single digits versus 2019. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain optimistic. Positive momentum has continued into the second quarter with April RevPAR tracking at roughly 95% of 2019 levels. While macro risks and uncertainty exists, forecast for economic growth remain healthy. Additionally, our ability to reprice rooms in real time creates a natural inflation hedge. We think there is a good likelihood that we'll reach 2019 system-wide RevPAR levels during the third quarter.  For the full year, we expect leisure RevPAR to exceed 2019 peak levels given excess consumer savings, a strong job market and pent-up demand. We expect business transient to be roughly back to 2019 levels by year-end, with expectations supported by rising corporate profits, rebounding demand from big businesses, and loosening travel restrictions. On the group side, we expect RevPAR to be at approximately 90% of 2019 levels by year-end, as demand for company meetings and convention business accelerates into the back half of the year. On the development front, our leading RevPAR index premiums and powerful commercial engines continued to drive out performance. In the quarter, we added more than 13,000 rooms and achieved 5% net unit growth. We continue to deliver on our commitment to discipline and strategic growth, celebrating important milestones across segments and geographies. We opened our 500th Homewood in the U.S., our 50th Hilton Garden Inn in Asia Pacific and debuted our largest hotel in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of the 1,080 room Hilton Singapore Orchard. With a contemporary design, innovative dining experiences and extensive meeting space, the property is a fantastic representation of our flagship brand and puts us in an even stronger position in Asia to usher in a new era of travel. Building on last quarter's momentum, we also continued expanding our lifestyle portfolio with the openings of the Canopy Boston Downtown and the Canopy New Orleans. Even with strong openings, we grew our pipeline to more than 410,000 rooms up year-over-year and versus the fourth quarter. We continue to lead the industry in new development signings with Home2 Suites surpassing all other competitor brands globally. We demonstrated our commitment to further expand our luxury and lifestyle portfolios in the world's most sought-after destinations with the signing of the Waldorf Astoria Sydney, the Conrad Austin Hotel & Residences, and Canopy Properties in Cannes and Downtown Nashville. We look forward to delivering world-class service and unforgettable experiences in these exciting destinations. Conversion signings in the quarter were up 15% year-over-year and represented nearly 20% of overall signings. In recent months, we signed agreements to bring our conversion-friendly brands, Curio and Tapestry to exciting destinations like the Galapagos Islands, San Sebastian Spain, Maui and Sonoma County, California. DoubleTree has continued to lead the way for European upscale growth with new conversion properties across France, Germany and the Netherlands. While rising costs are pressuring construction starts, we are on track to deliver 5% net unit growth for the year and remain confident in our ability to return to a 6% to 7% growth rate over the next few years. Reliable and friendly service are at the heart of our promise to our guests and we continue to leverage our direct channels to offer them even more personalized experiences. Direct bookings continued to grow in the quarter that represent roughly 75% of our total bookings led by growth in Digital Direct. OTA mix continued to decline and is approaching pre-pandemic levels as increases in business transient and group demand shifted customer mix. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 15% to more than 133 million members. Honors members accounted for 60% of occupancy, flat versus the first quarter of 2019. And average nights per member were up 11% year-over-year as engagement continued to grow.  As we continue recovering from the impacts of the pandemic, I am inspired every day by the dedication of our team members as we welcome more guests back to our hotels. It's because of them and our culture of hospitality, that we continue to be recognized as a Great Place To Work. In fact, Hilton was recently named the #2 best company to work for in the United States by Fortune and Great Place to Work, something I'm truly proud of. And now I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on our results in the quarter and our expectations for the year ahead. Kevin?
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 80.5% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 17% compared to 2019, impacted by the Omicron variant. Following a seasonally slow start to the year, demand picked up across all segments and regions in March, driven by continued strength in leisure demand and loosening corporate travel restrictions. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $448 million in the first quarter. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 79%, driven by meaningful RevPAR improvement and strong Honors license fees. Continued cost control further benefited results. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenging operating environment, particularly at the start of the year in Europe and Japan, where the portfolio is concentrated. Fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties also pressured results. However, performance improved throughout the quarter, driven by strengthening demand across Europe in March. Rebounding fundamentals, coupled with cost discipline should continue to drive significant growth in operating performance going forward. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.71. Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 77% year-over-year and was down 13% versus 2019. While the Omicron variant weighed on demand at the beginning of the year, RevPAR improved 17 percentage points over the course of the quarter, which marks down less than 6% versus 2019. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery with segment RevPAR exceeding 2019 levels for the quarter. Upticks in business transient and group travel, particularly in March, also contributed to solid performance in the quarter. In the Americas outside of the U.S., first quarter RevPAR increased 137% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. The Omicron variant suppressed demand in January and February, but rebounded in March led by strong leisure demand, particularly at resort properties during the spring break season.  In Europe, RevPAR grew 349% year-over-year and was down 30% to 2019. Travel demand accelerated following the Omicron outbreak with March RevPAR down 13% compared to 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and an increase in cross-border travel. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 121% year-over-year and was up 8% versus 2019. Performance continued to benefit from strong domestic leisure demand and greater international inbound travel as travel restrictions across Europe loosened.  In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR grew 11% year-over-year and was down 47% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 45% compared to 2019, as travel restrictions and reimposed lockdown suppressed demand. The rest of the Asia Pacific region saw modest improvement in demand recovery as more countries loosen border and arrival controls in March.  Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling over 410,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 60% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. We continue to see robust demand for Hilton-branded properties, demonstrating owner and developer confidence in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range year-over-year, and we expect net unit growth of approximately 5%. Moving to guidance. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be between 45% and 50% year-over-year or down 5% to 10% compared to second quarter 2019. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $590 million and $610 million, and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, to be between $0.98 and $1.03. For the full year 2022, we expect RevPAR growth between 32% and 38%. Relative to 2019, we expect RevPAR growth to be down 5% to 9%. We forecast adjusted EBITDA of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 40% at the midpoint, and essentially recovered to peak 2019 adjusted EBITDA. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of between $3.77 and $4.02. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. As Chris mentioned, we reinstated our share repurchase program in March, which had been suspended during the pandemic. Year-to-date through April, we completed approximately $265 million in buybacks and our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For the full year, we expect to return between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends, based on our adjusted EBITDA forecast and assuming the high end of our target leverage range of 3 to 3.5x. After demonstrating the strength and resiliency of our business model during the pandemic, we continue to evaluate the possibility of a modestly higher target leverage range in the future. Overall, we are proud of how we navigated the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue generating substantial free cash flow and delivering meaningful shareholder returns through buybacks and dividends. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: . And the first question will be from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.
Joseph Greff: Chris, how much of your second quarter and full year RevPAR guidance is occupancy-driven versus rate driven? How does moderating growth in leisure volumes, just given the tough comparisons and relatively higher growth in business transient group volumes, impact the blend of ADR and ADR growth in the second half?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean, we gave a lot of commentary on rate growth in the sense of giving you as much visibility as we had to represent the strength that we're seeing. I mean, we're wonderful, as I said in my prepared comments, inflation hedge because we can reprice every minute of every day. And as demand has picked up, we have certainly been able to do that, and we expect that we will continue to be able to do that. I think as the year goes on, we expect the largest part of RevPAR growth to come from rate growth. We obviously expect to see occupancy growth as well. But I think net-net, it will be majority driven by rate. In terms of the segments, leisure, broadly remains quite strong. I mean, right now, I think the number is consumers still have $2.5 trillion of excess savings that they accumulated during the pandemic in their pockets. While people have been out traveling a lot more than they had maybe a year ago, there's still a lot of people that haven't and a lot of people that really want to get out and have experiences. And so people that we have pretty full employment. People have a lot of money in their bank accounts. And I think now feel quite safe broadly, certainly here in the U.S., not everywhere in the world. Obviously, the world is a big place, but in the Western world feel safe going out. And so we expect to see very strong leisure continue. I mean we think we'll probably have the biggest leisure summer we've ever had, only to surpass last summer, which was the biggest leisure summer we had ever seen, prior to what I think we'll see this summer. And then as we get into the fall and as people go -- are back more in the office, which we certainly are seeing now and expect to see more of, we're seeing, as I articulated and Kevin did as well, we're seeing a very nice uptick in return to business transient and return on the group side.  The group side lags a little bit as we know. There's more planning involved in that, but we think the second half of the year is going to get stronger and stronger. And business transient, even over the last couple of months, we've seen pick up. And notably, and something I commented on in my prepared remarks, we've even seen the large corporates start to come back, where March was only 12% down. And April, you can assume was better. We don't have all the data on the breakdown in April, but certainly broadly, business transient was even better in April. So businesses have a lot of pent-up demand, needs for travel. Balance sheets are very, very strong. Profits are very strong. Liquidity is very, very strong. And so I think the combination of that, with what's going on with the consumer, and then sort of the icing on the cake is the group side, where there's just so much new demand, but then pent-up demand, all of which I think will start to converge here in the second half of this year and into next year. I think puts us in a place where we feel really good about the short to intermediate term, and both the demand side, but particularly the rate side. And again, the reason I gave, the stats I did about forward-looking booking trends on the transient side, which obviously only is so far out. But on the Group side, was that we really are seeing the ability to drive pricing power like a lot of industries are, but certainly makes us -- gives us the optimism that has led to our judgments on both giving guidance, but also on our return to capital program and the like.
Operator: And the next question will be from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: Chris, you talked a little bit about kind of business transient back at 45% versus, I believe, that was probably closer to 55% prepandemic. And obviously, Group is probably a couple of hundred below its normal mix. As that stuff comes back and you think about maybe a full year 2023 and occupancy in general, what kind of pricing power do you think you have at occupancy levels that are kind of commensurate with 2019 levels, which I believe were kind of $143, $143-ish?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, let me -- first, in terms of the mix, it's probably worth stating because I commented a teeny bit in my prepared comments. You're right, business transit sort of the mix pre-COVID was plus or minus 55 business transient, 25 leisure transient and 20 group. If you look at, sort of what I would sort of call, the bottom of the recession driven by the pandemic, it went to 35 business transient, 55 leisure and 10 group. Now it's 45 business transient, 39 leisure and 16 group.  And I've been saying this so pretty much for 2 years. In the beginning, people maybe thought it was crazy, but that when we wake up and this sort of flushes through the system and we get fully on the other side of it, that business mix is going to look an awful lot like it did pre-COVID. And I think we're on our way to that. And so I think when we look -- maybe not , I think leisure transient will probably remain elevated for a while. But I think it will -- it is regressing to the mean, and it will look more like it did than like it has looked, in '23 and certainly in '24.  In terms of broader pricing pressures, as all that comes back, not to be pedantic about it, but it's sort of the laws of supply and demand, economics, which is, if we have a product that's in high demand and increasing demand, and there's not a lot more -- there's not enough supply and not a lot is being added, which is sort of the case in terms of what's going on with all of our segments increasingly so in midweek and that's only going to increase and then you compound that with getting a decent group base starting in the second half of the year and the next year, I think we'll have meaningful pricing power next year, just because the laws of supply and demand suggest we should. And I think they're alive and well.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley: Not to probably overly dig into this, but Chris, I think in the prepared comments, you mentioned that April was running down only about 5%. That's obviously already kind of at the top end of the guidance you provided for the second quarter. So I think we all get that the background sounds pretty optimistic. But could you just help us kind of reconcile that? And maybe just some of the puts and takes around what it would take for things to be better than -- a little bit better than maybe what you've laid out in the guidance and/or what factors might have led you to be a little bit more conservative?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, I mean, the guidance we gave is the guidance we gave. First of all -- I mean I think, Shaun, there are -- it's a good question. I think there are some comp issues in certain months. But honestly, if you listen -- if you replay what I just said in response to Carlo's question, we believe that we're going to continue to see a very strong leisure demand base and an increasingly strong leisure -- business transient and group base as we march through the next few quarters of this year and into next year. So we're not trying to signal in our guidance that we think there's something going on from a weakening point of view. We think things are strengthening.
Shaun Kelley: Sorry to split hairs there. And maybe just as a quick follow-up, probably for Kevin. But could you just talk a little bit about -- obviously, the capital return guidance is super encouraging. Does that have you holding a specific leverage target? Or you've mentioned a couple of times in the past about possibly revisiting what that target would be, but what sort of implied in the $1.4 billion to $1.8 billion that we're getting here, and does that leave you a little bit of room to go even higher still, should you reevaluate it?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun. I mentioned this in my prepared remarks that may have been a little garbled, but it implies that high end of the range, it implies 3.5x. So embedded in that, yes, we've said and I said it in my prepared remarks that we continue to think about potentially increasing leverage modestly over time. We think the balance sheet is shown that it can handle a higher level of leverage and the business can handle a higher level of leverage given what we just went through.  And -- but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the world. And so we're starting with effectively 0.25x increase at the midpoint by saying we're at the high end of the range, and we'll take it from there.
Operator: And the next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: Just a couple of follow-up questions on growth. What's your level of confidence in the 5% guide this year? Any updated thoughts on timing or gain back to 6% to 7%? And just how are developments in China going?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. No problem. Look, we -- we're giving you the guidance. So we're highly confident that we can achieve it. Obviously, a lot of the stuff that's going on and that's going to deliver this year is construction in progress, and we have a pretty good handle on that. I mean getting back to where we were before. I mean Chris said it in his prepared remarks, over the next few years, getting back to 6% to 7% is going to mean that starts need to start getting back to where they were.  Now starts this year, we think, will be about flat maybe slightly down. That will be down in the U.S., up in international, which is consistent with what we've been saying. We're still going to start 66,000 rooms for construction this year, which we think is still a pretty good rate of conversions. And then we think that on a run rate basis, and some of that's going to be filled in by conversions. I mean, we mentioned some of that in our prepared remarks. Conversions, we think, are going to be up, were up 35% in the first quarter -- year-over-year. We think they're going to be up around 25% -- to about 25% or higher of our deliveries this year, so that will help fill in.  And then we think we'll get back to that run rate on a run rate basis sometime in 2024. We think we'll be back to the 6% to 7%.
Thomas Allen: And then, sorry, just China?
Kevin Jacobs: Oh yes, sorry, China, sorry. Yes. Look, China, what's going on now is that's very much in that part of the world, a face-to-face culture, right? So the fact that they're locked down in Shanghai, a little bit in Beijing, and other places is stopping signings temporarily, but we still think we're going to be up slightly in terms of construction starts. And we think we're going to open about 20% more rooms in China this year than we did last year. And so we think that once you get past kind of what's going on there on the ground, that there's plenty of pent-up demand for the product, and once people can start moving around, we'll be back to sort of business as usual in China.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: On the contract acquisition cost side, it looks like in your guidance, picked up a bit versus pre-pandemic levels. How should we think about this level versus a normalized run rate over the next few years? And is that investment coming in the form of loans and mezzanine equity? Or is it just straight investment in the deals about a future interest?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. I think, look, it is -- this year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year -- for a start. It is up over 2019. It's largely a good news story, as we've talked about on prior calls, right? I mean -- and it's almost entirely key money. It's not to say that, we never do a little bit of credit support or a little bit of a handful of mezz loans here and there, but it's almost entirely key money that has that elevated from pre-pandemic levels. There's some great deals. Last year like Monarch Beach and -- are all inclusive into Loom and deals like that -- Resorts World Las Vegas was 1 of the big ones.  And so those are great deals to win. Some of them are -- sometimes their conversions as in Monarch Beach, and so they're in the year for the year deals, and they get a little bit of expensive at the high end, as we've talked about. This year's guidance implies a little bit lower than last year, and we'd like to think it will be around there for the next couple of years, because we'd like to think we continue to win more than our fair share of these great deals.  And I think what I'd say overall in closing is, I think it's still only 10% of our deals, 90% of our deals require no capital support from us whatsoever. And I think that our contract acquisition cost still holds up pretty well versus our competitors.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz from Jefferies.
David Katz: I just wanted to go back to the notion of NUG and construction starts, et cetera, because we do continue to hear bits and pieces around supply chain and availability and cost of materials. Can you just elaborate maybe a bit more on what you're baking into your guide and your thoughts from that perspective?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, happy to, David. I think that, look, the factors are well known, right? Input costs are up. You've got tightness in the labor markets. You've got input prices in terms of commodities. You've got financing. All of which has been the case for a while. And believe it or not, despite what you read, it's actually easing a little bit at the moment, but it's still elevated. And that's all baked into the guidance, right? That's why construction starts will be flat to slightly down this year. Otherwise, they would probably be up materially. They're down 25% roughly to where they were in 2019.  Demand for the product -- based on the optimism and the outlook, demand for the product is actually up. I mean we think our signings will be up in the mid- to high single digits this year. And there's that same level of optimism in terms of people wanting to get the project started, it's just being held back by the factors that you're talking about. So those factors are there. They'll probably be there for some period of time. And we think like all things that are cyclical, they will ease over time. And then the fact that our signings are up is what gives us the confidence to believe that our starts will go back to where they were roughly in 2019 and that our NUG will go back to 6% to 7%.
Christopher Nassetta: I think that's right. The only thing I'd sort of add to that, and Kevin said earlier in his comments is, inflation is our friend and it's our owner's friend. So if you look at what we've done in the system during COVID as a result of sort of going through every granular, standard for every single brand, we've been able to drive a lot of efficiency at the hotel level. At the same time, obviously, labor costs have been going up. But when you put all of it into the gonkulator, so to speak, with the savings we've created with the inflationary pressures, which are driving their rate up, and obviously, expenses aren't 100% of revenues. So they've got a positive -- they've got positive leverage there.  Even in the face of increased labor costs, we are very confident that across all of our brands on a sort of comparable basis, margins are higher. So the enthusiasm in our owner community and why, as Kevin rightly pointed out, we think signings are going to be up is, that our brands are doing great. They're driving great cheer and people are optimistic with recovery, but they're also looking at an equation where they're going to be able to drive higher margins on the other side.  Now we have to have the financing market sort of continue to input cost, all that, which will take a little bit of time. And in the meantime, we're having great success in the conversion world. We're going to probably, as Kevin said, increased conversions this year relative to last by 600 basis points of total NUG delivery. So we feel pretty good about where we are.
David Katz: Okay. If I may just follow up quickly and use your gonkulator 1 more time. The owned and leased aspect of the model looks like it really has 2 sides to it. One, which is kind of a friend in this recovery and the other that strikes me as a bit more challenging. Are there potential ways in the future that you can deal with the more challenging aspects of it and turn them into a positive in some way?
Kevin Jacobs: Well, sure. I mean, look, first of all, I'll start out with -- I implied this or I said this in my remarks that portfolio -- the performance in that portfolio is improving, that is starting to turn around. It's been concentrated in parts of the world that have been a little bit behind from a COVID recovery perspective, Central Europe and Japan, in particular. As that portfolio recovers, it will contribute meaningfully to our growth rate, meaning the EBITDA in that portfolio is going to grow at a much higher rate over the next couple of years than the overall fee business is. And so it's going to contribute positively to our growth.  So finding a positive there to your question, and we think that from an EBITDA perspective over the course of this year, it's going to turn positive, and then we actually think it will be positive -- slightly positive as an EBITDA contributor this year. And then I think what we can do is what we've been doing, right? I mean we have quite a large portfolio of leased assets when we inherited the company. We've chipped away at it such that it used to be 9% or 10% of the EBITDA of the business on a stabilized basis, it is going to be sub 5% of the -- even when it recovers over the next few years at a higher rate than the overall business, the fee business continues to grow. We shrink the lease portfolio over time. It's going to be less than 5% of the business over time.  We got out of 7 leases last year. We allowed 4 of them to expire and then -- because we couldn't come to terms with the landlord on renewing them or we didn't want to be there, and we converted 3 of them to management or franchise agreements, so they stayed in the system and they moved from the capital heavy part of the business to the capital-light part of the business. So we'll continue to take those opportunities over time. And that will end up being a positive as we shrink that business and grow the rest of the business over time.
Operator: The next question is from Smedes Rose from Citi.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to just ask you, when you think about your guidance for the year, and it's great that you have the visibility to provide that. Kind of how are you thinking specifically about which is actually in China and Europe over the balance of the year. You touched on that a little bit with Europe, I guess, with your O&L comments, but maybe just a little -- some more color on how you think that could shape up?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think at a high level, Smedes, the way I think about Europe is, Europe is recovering quite nicely, not Eastern Europe, but the bulk of our business in Europe is driven by Western Europe. And Europe is not quite as far along as the United States, but has been motoring along. Kevin gave you a few of the stats that I think support that. So we expect, like the U.S., Europe -- Western Europe to continue to recover. Our expectation is Eastern Europe for the foreseeable future is going to be quite challenged. But again, a very, very small insignificant part of the portfolio being impacted by that. And China, obviously, a more complex situation. We have a view. We have forecast, which is why we can build it in and give guidance. I think our expectation is in the second half of the year, as China goes through a process of locking down some of the major cities and then reopening them, that China is going to reopen for China at a minimum. Not necessarily China opening for international arrivals. But as we saw in the early stages of the pandemic when China got way ahead of the rest of the world, when China opens for China in China business, our business does quite well and can recover very, very rapidly.  So our expectation is second half of the year, you will see China start to reopen really with more benefit in the fourth quarter and into next year than in the third quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin Farley: Just some quick ones. Can you talk a little bit about the booking window? I feel like last fall, it was down to sort of less than a week, and maybe pre-pandemic had been more like 30 days. Just kind of where are we now with that visibility?
Christopher Nassetta: Booking windows are extending as you might guess. I think within 7 days, it's now -- it had gotten to be a vast majority at the worst of COVID was booked within 7 days. I think we're approaching in April 50-50, plus or minus, like 50% of the business within 7 days, 50% longer. So huge, huge improvement from where we were.
Robin Farley: Great. And then on the OTA business, the distribution mix. You mentioned it was down, which makes sense as business transient comes back. Was that -- you mentioned 85% direct, which I assume includes I guess...
Christopher Nassetta: 75% direct. We didn't give an OTA percentage, we typically wouldn't. But we're in sort of the pre-pandemic, we were in the very low teens, which is what we sort of believe the efficient frontier is for the business to be able to drive the best results for our ownership community. And I would say in the quarter, we're basically there, plus or minus.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last thing on group. And you kind of -- you've addressed a lot of it in your opening remarks. I think you said you expected that by the end of the year to be at 90% of '19 levels. Fair to say that you expect '23 to be kind of back at 2019 levels?  And then also, I don't know if you gave a pacing for like what percent of '23 room nights are booked compared to like what was booked at this time, pre-pandemic. Just to think about it.
Christopher Nassetta: We didn't. I think the answer to the first question is, yes. I do think '23 will be back at -- for group, will be back at '19 levels. We did not give a stat. I think the stat from the best of my memory is about 15% down versus '19 at the moment for '23. But as I articulated in the prepared comments, our sales folks can hardly keep up with all the leads that are coming in for the second half of this year and particularly into next year. And so I think just given the trajectory of how this recovery has occurred and what we've seen sort of in the year for the year business. I wouldn't read a whole lot into being 15 down for next year.  We have plenty of time to book that. And importantly, the rates are basically low double digits at the moment. The book business is low double digit higher than '19. And so part of what we're obviously trying to do is maximize the outcome, rate flows really nicely for our ownership community. So we're not -- we really don't want to rush too much in this kind of inflationary environment, because we know the business is going to be there, and we want to put it on the books at the highest rates possible.  And so we're sort of taking our time and metering it out. I suspect, as I said, next year, we will be at volumes similar to 2019 when we're done with 2023 and at rates much higher than 2019.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes from Truist Securities.
Charles Scholes: For your net unit growth guidance of approximately 5%, how do those -- how do those percentages break down by global region? Or basically, what are those percentages by growth rates by different regions?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. It should be -- Patrick, it should be pretty similar to -- the rooms under construction are about 80% international. I don't have the sub-breakdown in front of me right now for where it breaks out. But it ought to deliver a plus or minus what the rooms under construction are 20% in the U.S., about 80% outside the U.S.
Charles Scholes: Okay. Do you happen to have any of the -- what the expectation is for the China growth rate?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Well, for openings, I think I said in 1 of my earlier answers, we think that openings -- rooms opened in China this year are going to be 20% up year-over-year.
Operator: And the next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.
William Crow: Chris, I continue to be -- I continue to be really fascinated by this interplay between the brands and the owners at a time when occupancy and rates are ramping up, but labor continues to be kind of short. And I'm just wondering what you're seeing with guest satisfaction scores and if you have any concerns about that as we head into the busy summer months?
Christopher Nassetta: We -- yes, I mean I'd say first on the labor front, there are still significant issues that we're seeing, both in what we manage and as we talk to our franchise community, what they're seeing. Over the last 6 months, we've seen a very significant increase in labor coming back into the labor force and our ability to get folks in the hotels, which obviously are needed, given the demand profile and the increases in demand across all segments, as I already described. So we're not all the way anywhere near where we want to be, but the issues are not -- they're not as extreme as they had been at other points in the pandemic, including recently.  In terms of customer satisfaction, I think, listen, I think all service industries have suffered, and we're right there along with the rest of them. We've been intensely monitoring and we have all sorts of ways to do that, both through social, but our own tracking systems that we call self satisfaction and loyalty tracking. And what I've seen is those numbers that had sort of bottomed out in the middle of the pandemic have started to come back and go the other way, as we've been able to get labor and bring some of the services back. Our social scores, I think the last I saw lead the industry and have been moving up in a positive way. So we have -- we're not satisfied with what we're doing right now. I think the team sitting at this table would say, I've been pounding the table a lot. We like what we're doing. We're on a good trajectory. We need to get more labor back in. We need to restore more services, get food and beverage back on track and other services. And we're obviously sensitive -- very sensitive as you sort of implied in your question to the cost structure for our owner community. But the reality is the demand is there, and we're charging for it. So we have to deliver the experience or ultimately we're going to impair our ability to continue to drive rate, if we don't deliver the basic experience.  So I'm confident we will, our owner community broadly. You talk to a lot of them, but I talk to tons of them. They're broadly understanding of it. They're supportive. They're seeing the pricing pressure and they realize that we have to work together to get there. We have been -- as I mentioned in my earlier response, we have been super crazy focused on making sure that when we get to the other side of this, this is a better setup for our owner community than what we had before the pandemic. And we continue to work really hard on that, and we're confident, on a comparable basis, that they will be in a better place and that inflation is their friend, it's our friend and the cost savings and initiatives that we -- that we pursued and implemented during COVID are going to pay dividends for a long time to come.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon from Macquarie.
Chad Beynon: We've heard a lot about airline price increases recently in, I guess, upcoming in the next couple of months. Seems like the operators are pushing through the fuel increases to the consumer. And I know, in your prepared remarks, you noted that March and spring break were strong for the leisure customer, so it doesn't sound like there's been any pushback at this point. But can you talk about, I guess, what you've seen during different cycles as gas prices have remained elevated and if you think that could impact kind of the mindset of the leisure customer for the rest of '22?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I've been doing this a long time, and we've been studying this a long time, and in fact, got our team to update, R Squared on this, just so we could be technically accurate, I like numbers. And the reality is if you go back over long periods of history, there is not a very high R square. There is not a very high correlation. In fact, there's a very low correlation between what's going on with fuel prices and demand in our business. You can go back to like the '08, '09, when oil hit 150-plus a barrel, and we went, looked at all those periods. And there's not a very high correlation.  I think it has a lot to do with the consumer psychology, which at the moment, there are certainly lots of fears and uncertainty about where the world goes. But at the moment, as I said, the consumer has an abundant amount of savings as do businesses and a burning desire to sort of get out there and do business and/or experience the world having been locked up a lot more than they would have liked to. So we're not really seeing any of it. Now there's also a phenomenon that is we'll shift around, but if you looked at our business prepandemic, sort of roughly 2/3 of the business, 60% to 2/3 were fly to and the rest were drive to.  That's flipped around during the pandemic. And it's still disproportionately, the majority right now even with where we are in recovery, are people driving. So part of this is there's -- now gas prices are going up, too, but maybe not proportionately as much as the airline ticket is. So there is a little bit of a substitution effect that I suspect is going on with people deciding they'll drive a little further, right? They kind of got used to COVID like, hey, it might have been a 2- or 3-hour sort of limit, before and now it's a 5-, 6-, 7-hour limit for what they're willing to endure to drive.  And so it's a long-winded way of saying, we have not seen resistance and we do not, in looking at very detailed analysis of R Squares, we do not historically see a lot of high correlation.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Clarke from Bernstein.
Richard Clarke: Just one thing I noticed is the number of managed rooms has actually come down quarter-on-quarter by over 2,000, which is the biggest drop I can find. And some quite big drops by brand, DoubleTree, Waldorf, Astoria. Is this a strategy? Are you moving away from franchise towards managed towards more franchise? And if that's the case, maybe why are you leaning away from the incentive fees in the recovery? Or is this more an owner-led shift?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Look, Richard, it's a good question. I don't have quarter-over-quarter shift in front of me. You're probably right, if you're looking at it, that it's a relatively big shift. Some of that is things converting to franchise, right? They're staying in the system. They're not necessarily coming out. And it's not strategic. We still -- our rooms under construction, like I said earlier, 80% outside the U.S., that's 50-50 managed versus franchise outside the U.S.  So the reality is we go where the demand is in the developed world, a little bit more demand at the lower end right now for new construction, right, and new deliveries. And so we fish where the fish are, right? And so the market takes us there. There's more customer demand and more owner demand a little bit, and again, in the developed world, towards franchising. And in the developing world, it's about 50-50.
Richard Clarke: And just you just mentioned there that you've seen some shift from managed to franchise. Why does that process take place?
Kevin Jacobs: Where does it take place?
Robin Farley: No, why does it take place?
Kevin Jacobs: Owner demand -- I mean customer demand for the product at the lower end and owner demand for franchising. So it's...
Christopher Nassetta: And if you look at the regions of the world, I mean, the U.S. has always been a predominantly sort of franchise-oriented environment. If you look at our makeup here, it's a majority -- vast majority of its franchise. 10 years ago, there was no franchising going on in Europe. Today, they is. So we have a much more sort of blended approach. It's like 50-50. If you went to Asia Pacific, five years ago, 7 years ago, it was 0 franchise. Now franchising is, particularly in China, is growing, and it's an opportunity for us, particularly with mid-market brands, to be able to create a network effect much, much faster.  And we feel super confident in our ability to manage a franchise system. I don't think there's anybody better in terms of delivering great product and great service to customers. So it's driven a lot by sort of the owner desires and sort of the evolution of the business around the world as different parts of the world mature.
Operator: The next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research.
Vince Ciepiel: I had a question on cross-border. Could you remind us like how much international arrivals is as a percentage of your U.S. room nights? I think it's pretty small, but kind of how that business is performing today versus pre-COVID if you've seen recent progress there? And then kind of the other way around, when you look at, say, your European business and North American guests heading there for this summer, can you describe kind of what you've seen with booking behavior in the last few months?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes.
Christopher Nassetta: Go ahead.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure, on a normalized basis and you pre-Covid the U.S. is about 95:5, right? About 95% of the customers comes from inside the U.S. 5% outside. Now in big cities like New York, San Francisco, L.A., that could be up to 20% for cross-border. That obviously plummeted during COVID, right, to near 0 and now is actually approaching pretty close to normalized mix, both in the U.S. and Europe. Europe is more about 2/3, 1/3 within the region and outside of the region. And again, that's actually back to approaching levels where it was pre-COVID as the world is opening up.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. I think you could probably hear the enthusiasm in our voice. It's been quite a couple of years, but I do believe that the decisions we made, the actions we took during the pandemic have put Hilton in the best position it's ever been in from the standpoint of driving performance, margins, driving free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders in the years to come. We're super excited about what we think is going to play out for the rest of the year, and we'll look forward after the second quarter to updating you on that progress. Thanks again for the time today.
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2022-02-16 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. As our results show, we made significant progress in our recovery throughout 2021. We saw a meaningful increase in demand for travel and tourism and our team members around the world were there to welcome guests with our signature hospitality as they look to reconnect and create new memories. We continued to demonstrate our resiliency by remaining laser-focused on providing reliable and friendly service to our guests and by launching several new industry-leading offerings to provide them even more choice and control. We also continued to expand our global footprint, adding even more exciting destinations to our portfolio and achieving a record year of room openings. All of this, together with our resilient business model, translated into solid results. For the full year, we grew RevPAR 60% and adjusted EBITDA 93%. Both RevPAR and adjusted EBITDA were approximately 30% below 2019 peak levels. More importantly, our margins were 500 basis points above 2019 peak levels, reaching roughly 66% for the full year. While some costs will come back in as we continue to recover, we remain extremely focused on cost discipline. Given our asset-light business model and the actions we took during the pandemic to further streamline our operations, we expect permanent margin improvement versus prior peak levels in the range of 400 to 600 basis points over the next few years. Turning to results for the quarter. RevPAR increased 104% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA was up 151%. RevPAR was roughly 87% of 2019 levels with ADR nearly back to prior peaks. Compared to 2019, occupancy improved versus the third quarter with higher demand across all segments. Strong leisure over the holiday season drove U.S. RevPAR to more than 98% of 2019 levels for December. Business travel also improved sequentially versus the third quarter, with solid demand in October and November before the Omicron variant weighed on recovery in December. For the quarter, business transient room nights were approximately 80% of 2019 levels. Group RevPAR improved 11 percentage points over the third quarter to roughly 70% of 2019 levels. Performance was largely driven by strong social business, while recovery in company meetings and larger groups continued to lag. As we kicked off the new year, seasonally softer leisure demand, coupled with incremental COVID impacts due to the Omicron variant, tempered the positive momentum we saw through much of the fourth quarter. For January, system-wide RevPAR was approximately 75% of 2019 levels. Despite some near-term choppiness, we remain optimistic about accelerated recovery across all segments throughout 2022. We anticipate strong leisure trends to continue again this year, driven by pent-up demand and nearly $2.5 trillion of excess consumer savings. Our revenue position for Presidents' weekend is seven percentage points ahead of 2019 levels. And our position for weekends generally is up significantly for the year, both indicating continued strength in leisure travel. Similarly, we expect growth in GDP and nonresidential fixed investment, coupled with more flexible travel policies across large corporate customers to fuel increasing business transient trends. As a positive indication of business transient recovery, at the beginning of January, midweek U.S. transient bookings for all future periods were down 13% from 2019 levels and improved to just down 4% by the end of the month. Additionally, STR projects U.S. business transient demand will return to 92% of pre-pandemic levels in 2022. On the group side, our position for the year is to remain steady as Omicron-related disruption was largely contained to the first quarter of 2022 with most events rescheduled for later in the year. We continue to expect meaningful acceleration in group business in the back half of the year as underlying group demand remains strong. Compared to 2019, our tentative booking revenue was up more than 25%. Additionally, meeting planners are increasingly more optimistic with forward bookings trending up week over week since early January. Overall, we remain very confident in the broader recovery and our ability to keep driving value on top of that. This should allow us to generate strong free cash flow growth and our expectation is to reinstate our quarterly dividend and begin buying back stock in the second quarter. Turning to development. We opened more than a hotel a day in 2021, totaling 414 properties and a record 67,000 rooms. Conversions represented roughly 20% of openings. We achieved net unit growth of 5.6% for the year, above the high end of our guidance and added approximately 55,000 net rooms globally, exceeding all major branded competitors. Our outperformance reflects the power of our commercial engines, the strength of our brands and our disciplined and diversified growth strategy. Fourth quarter openings totaled more than 16,000 rooms, driven largely by the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. In the quarter, we celebrated the opening of our 400th hotel in China and our first Home2 Suites in the country. This positive momentum continued into the new year with the highly anticipated opening of the Conrad Shanghai just last month, marking the brand's debut in one of the world's busiest and most exciting markets. During the quarter, we also continued the expansion of our luxury and resort portfolios with the opening of the Conrad Tulum and the new all-inclusive Hilton Cancun. With more than 400 luxury and resort hotels around the world and hundreds more in the pipeline, we remain focused on growing in these very important categories. We were also thrilled to welcome guests to the Motto New York City Chelsea, a major milestone for this quickly growing brand and a perfect addition to Hilton's expanding lifestyle category. This hotel exemplifies what it means to be a lifestyle property. It incorporates unique and modern design elements and provides guests with authentic and locally minded experiences. We also celebrated the first lifestyle property in Chicago with the opening of the Canopy Chicago Central Loop and debuted the brand in the U.K. with the opening of the Canopy London City. These spectacular properties joined recently opened Canopy hotels in Paris, Madrid and São Paulo. In 2021, we grew our Canopy portfolio by more than 1/3 year-over-year, opening hotels across all major regions. We ended the year with 408,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year, even after a record year of openings. Our pipeline represents an industry-leading 38% of our existing supply, giving us confidence in our ability to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth for the next couple of years and eventually return to our prior 6% to 7% growth range. For this year, we expect net unit growth to be approximately 5%. As our guests' travel needs continue to evolve, we again introduced innovative ways to enhance the guest experience. In the quarter, we announced the launch of Digital Key Share which allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key via the Hilton Honors app. To further reward our most loyal Hilton Honors members, we introduced automated complimentary room upgrades, notifying eligible members of upgrades 72 hours prior to arrival. With our guests at the heart of everything we do, we've been thrilled to hear that the early feedback for both industry-leading features has been overwhelmingly positive. In the quarter, Hilton Honors membership grew 13% year-over-year to more than 128 million members. Honors members accounted for 61% of occupancy in the quarter, just a few points below 2019 levels and engagement continued to increase across members of all tiers. We work hard to ensure that our hospitality continues to have a positive impact on the communities we serve. For that reason, we're incredibly proud to be recognized for our global leadership in sustainability. For the fifth consecutive year, we were included on both the World and North America Dow Jones Sustainability Indices, the most prestigious ranking for corporate sustainability performance. Overall, I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made over the last year and I'm very confident that Hilton is better positioned than ever to lead the industry as we enter a new era of travel. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on the quarter.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 104.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis. System-wide RevPAR was down 13.5% compared to 2019 as the recovery continued to accelerate across all segments and regions, driven by border reopenings and strong holiday travel demand. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $512 million for the fourth quarter, up 151% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 91%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging operating environment and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost discipline mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.72. Turning to our regional performance. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 110% year-over-year and was down 11% versus 2019. The U.S. benefited from strong leisure demand over the holidays, with transient RevPAR 1% above 2019 levels and transient rate nearly 5% higher than 2019 for the quarter. Group business also continued to strengthen throughout the quarter, with December room nights just 12% off of 2019 levels. In the Americas outside of the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR increased 150% year-over-year and was down 17% versus 2019. Continued easing restrictions and holiday leisure demand drove improving trends throughout the quarter. Canada continued to see steady improvement as borders remained open to vaccinated international travelers. In Europe, RevPAR grew 306% year-over-year and was down 25% versus 2019. Travel demand recovered steadily through November but stalled in December as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions across the region. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 124% year-over-year and was up 7% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and the continued recovery of international inbound travel as restrictions eased. In the Asia Pacific region, fourth quarter RevPAR fell 1% year-over-year and was down 34% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 24% as compared to 2019 as travel restrictions and lockdowns remained in place. However, occupancy in the country held steady versus the third quarter as summer leisure travel was replaced with local corporate and meetings business. The rest of the Asia Pacific region benefited from relaxed COVID restrictions and the introduction of vaccinated travel lanes in several key markets. Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, for the full year, we grew net units 5.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially and year-over-year, totaling 408,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 61% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. and roughly half under construction. Demand for Hilton-branded properties remains robust and, along with our high-quality pipeline, we are positioned to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.5 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated through the pandemic and remain confident in our ability to continue to be an engine of opportunity and growth as we look to reinstate our capital return program. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results can be found in the earnings release we issued this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?
Operator:  The first question will be from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
ShaunKelley: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Morning, John.
Shaun Kelley: Good morning, Chris. I wanted to dig in a little bit. I thought the margin commentary you gave was interesting, Chris. I mean in general, we don't think of -- I think we think of hotels being more about recovery beneficiaries than we do it thinking through the pandemic and some of the opportunities that may have presented on the cost side. So could you just give us a little bit more color on what some of the key buckets are that have changed in your overall operating model that are driving that improvement? And then secondarily, just help us think through how that might trend over the next couple of years as you kind of ramp up towards that 500 basis point margin target that you mentioned.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I'm happy to do it. We put it in the comments because the truth is it's, I would argue, very important. I don't think it's had a lot of focus and it has an intense amount of focus inside this company amongst the management team and, for that matter, with our Board of Directors because the idea was, as you would want to do in any crisis, is take advantage of opportunity. And as we went into the crisis, we saw things that we thought we've not only needed to do to address the crisis but we could do to make the business stronger. And so we didn't obviously have a lot to worry about liquidity. We had a lot to worry about but our balance sheet is great. We didn't have a lot of liquidity issues. So we very quickly, not to pat us on the back but it's true. Like in March, April of 2020, we were focused on recovery, how do we get to the other side, what are the things that we can do to make this business faster growing, better, stronger and higher margin. And we've been at it ever since and we'll never stop because we think there are opportunities. I think if you did the math, it sort of comes in three categories that gets you there. Number one, we're bigger. So you have units that have been added at plus 5% a year through COVID that haven't been, during COVID, that productive that are, over the next few years, going to become productive contributors to earnings. We've had great success in our sort of license arrangements and sort of our non-RevPAR-related fee segment of the business. So think our HGV business, think our Amex co-brand business generally where we -- it's a very, very high-margin business and it has performed very well. If you look at the numbers carefully, 2021, we were already over peak levels for those fees -- peak '19 -- 2019 levels and we think there's still meaningful growth to come from that. And then last but not least and importantly, cost structure. We, like everybody, every business that was dramatically impacted by COVID, had to think about cutting costs in hotels and in corporate and we did that. But again, not patting us on the back but reality, we said, like, we don't want to just take cost out. We want to sort of reengineer the way we run the business to be able to -- where we think there might be longer-term efficiencies, realize those and during COVID sort of get -- build it into the DNA of the company. And so we were able to take out a bunch of costs that helped during COVID but that we think we will be able to keep out. When you put all that together, as we said, we think it's 400 to 600 basis points of sort of a real run rate margin improvement. We delivered pretty well against, I thought, last year when we had RevPAR and EBITDA that was 30% off of peak levels and delivering 500 basis point margin levels was pretty compelling as a down payment on what we're saying. Now it won't be a perfectly straight road, meaning there are -- last year, we probably underspent in some areas because it's been hard to hire and all that, corporately. This year, we'll catch up a little bit with that. So it won't be a completely straight line. But as you look out to like '23 and '24, I think we're in those target ranges, hopefully at the midpoint or beyond those, at least as we model it. And as I said, it's not by happenstance, it's not by luck. It's been a huge focus and I think shareholders should feel comfortable that it will remain an intense focus of the enterprise because we know we can. And if we can, we should because ultimately and I won't finish this because I'm sure others have questions that we want to have answered ultimately. Obviously, we're a free -- when we -- in a normal time, we're a free cash flow machine. The higher the margins, the higher the free cash flow and having 500 basis point higher margins allows us to drive a lot more free cash flow that allows us to return a lot more capital over time. And as I said in my prepared comments, we intend to start returning capital in the second quarter. That is the second quarter of this year, that is six weeks from now.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
JoeGreff: Good morning, everybody.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff: I have a two part question on development. One, it's hard not to notice that the managed footprint has caught up at least relative to the growth rate into 2019. How do you see the footprint growth between managed and franchised growing in 2022? I know you talked about 5% this year, longer term 6% to 7%. And then can you also just talk about what's going on development-wise in China currently?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take this one. I think it's interesting. I'm not exactly sure what numbers you're looking at. I think our split between managed and franchised, as the pipeline plays out, has been pretty consistent, right? Our existing supply is 75% franchised led by the U.S. and the Americas, of course. But more and more, our pipeline today is 40% franchised outside -- in -- sorry, 40% franchised in EMEA and nearly half franchised in APAC as our franchisee business grows in those regions. And so over time, what had been happening is growing outside the U.S., more of those deals had been managed and that was sort of skewing us back towards managed. And now I'd say we're on a trajectory overall. We'll still add a bunch of managed rooms as we grow outside the U.S. but more and more, we're doing franchising outside of the U.S. And so maybe I'm missing something in your question and I'm happy to do a follow-up but I think that's been pretty consistent and not really moving around that much. And then, interestingly -- and so feel free to follow up. But to get to China, it's interesting. Most of the development trends and I think we've said this on prior calls, have been following the trend of the virus. So meaning, as the world's been opening up in those regions, you see a pretty direct correlation to signing activity and approval activity in those regions, so led by the U.S. Europe had sort of a slow start this year but then really came on towards the end of the year as things start to open up. China has been kind of the exception to that rule, meaning even with lockdowns and people not moving around and you would think not being able to travel across the country, would slow the pace of activity but that just hasn't been the case. So for us, we -- our approvals for 2021 were up 45% for the year and our openings were up 30% over the year. And we think our openings will be up something similar to that over the course of 2022. So China has really been strong, led by our Plateno-Hampton JV. We've now launched Home2 with Country Garden. We've now launched on our own -- an individual franchising program for Hilton Garden Inn, with still a bunch of, Chris mentioned a little bit in our prepared remarks, still a bunch of really great full-service and luxury signings along the way. So China has been a little bit of the exception to the rule with COVID where even in the face of lockdowns, we've had a lot of activity.
Joe Greff: Great, you answered it . Thanks, Kevin.
Operator: And the next question will come from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
ThomasAllen: Thank you. Just a follow-up to Shaun's question, maybe a clarification. As I look at 2024 consensus for you, The Street is looking for $3.1 billion of EBITDA and 70% margin. Your comments earlier, Chris, was we're going to gain 400 to 600 basis points of margin versus 2019 which ties you in that 65%, 66% range. Do you think -- what do you think The Street's modeling -- mis-modeling?
Chris Nassetta: I have no earthly idea. As you know, we haven't been giving guidance for any period of time, let alone for 2024. So Thomas, I think the best thing to do is let my comments stand as they were. We're confident that on a run rate basis, it will sort of be in that range. We're very proud of that, of being able to accomplish that. Obviously, we're always looking to under-promise and over-deliver; so that will never change but not much to add at this point.
Thomas Allen: All right. Chris, just -- I mean, I guess asked another way, two things I was thinking of when you said it: one, there's obviously going to be a mix shift of the lower-margin owned business coming back. And then secondly, when we look at your margins historically, they increased every single year. So I guess the point I'm making is, I think your commentary around margins is more your confidence around resetting margins higher versus commentary that your expense base will grow significantly and you're kind of -- you're stuck at the margin level. Is that the right way to think about it?
Chris Nassetta: I'm not sure I understand but I think so. Yes. I mean we have confidence -- said another way, just to be clear, we have confidence that the structural changes we have made to the company on a like-for-like basis are going to drive higher margins. So if you think that margins were going to continue to grow organically under the prior setup, then we agree with that and we think that there's an incremental piece to it that is a result of structural changes that we've made that we'll maintain.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I'd probably just add to that quickly on the real estate is like you're making a comment about the mix of business but you should remember that the real estate has been shrinking over time. And even though you've had -- you've got different rates of recovery in COVID and different mix, over time, that is going to continue to be a smaller part of the business as we continue to grow the managed and franchised business and continue to work our way out of the risk.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. And not to beat a dead horse but just throw something slightly more on top of the real estate. The real estate, you're right, is a lower-margin business by definition. We have baked that into what we -- what our guidance -- what my summary was of what our expectation is over the next few years. So that was taken into account. It also, from an EBITDA growth point of view, will be tremendously helpful because it was so beat up, given the structure of how much of it is held that from an EBITDA growth rate point of view over the next few years, real estate is going to be very, very helpful, very high growth.
Thomas Allen: Thanks for the clarification.
Operator: And the next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
SmedesRose: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your thoughts on China. And maybe you could just give us a reminder of what the kind of contribution China made to fees in '19 and maybe kind of how far that fell off in '21, just because it seems like there's an opportunity for some significant rebounding. Maybe it sounds like it's running behind kind of the rest of the world. And if you have any kind of thoughts on maybe how China addresses it's policy around COVID going forward or if they keep the kind of zero tolerance in place indefinitely.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I think China, I'm doing this from memory, I think China '19 was like five points of EBITDA overall. And I would guess at this point, it is less than half of that. So I'm looking at Jill. It's probably 2% or something like that. So I think you're right. There's a significant -- I mean, by the way, that's true for the entire international estate when you think about it. Our Asia Pacific business, our Europe business, they've all been slower to return. And so our EBITDA, if you look at '20 and '21, was crazy disproportionately U.S.-based and those numbers aren't fully back to where they were. I mean we were like 73% U.S. I think in 2020, we were like 94% or 95% and last year, we were like 83% or something. So it's coming back and will ultimately return to a more normalized kind of environment which means not just China but the whole world. The whole world outside of the U.S. has some significant growth potential as we get to a more normalized environment. In terms of the regions generally and I'll end on China and maybe use this as an opportunity to just talk about sort of the rhythms of what's going on, most of which I think is pretty well known because you guys have a lot of data. But if you look at what's going on in the world, the Middle East which is not a huge part of our business, is sort of leading the world. I mean you saw our numbers for the fourth quarter. Middle East is already meaningfully above 2019 levels, so they're sort of ahead in recovery. We think that will continue. The U.S., I would say, is sort of next and we can -- maybe I'll leave it to another question. Our belief is you will see, in the second quarter, a transition and then very rapid recovery, all our earlier prepared comments, in the second half of the year. I think Europe will be quick to follow in the sense that it's more complicated because you have more countries, the restrictions aren't just one set of restrictions but you can start to see it sort of sweeping through Europe opening, sweeping through Europe. Now Asia Pacific, I think, will lag in large part because of China and the policies they've had. My own view and that's all it is. It's not because of insider knowledge is that as the rest of the world opens and as you get which I think we are rapidly approaching to an endemic stage of COVID, I think there'll be a lot of pressure economically, culturally and otherwise for China to open up much like the rest of the world. So I think it will be -- it will lag but I think it will be -- I think Europe and then Asia will be a fast follow. And as I think we -- as we -- my own view as we get to the second half of the year, I think you're in an entirely different environment across the globe. And in the first half of the year, you're going to see things evolving at a slightly different pace. But I think when you get to the second half of the year, every -- the whole world broadly is going to be a lot more open than anything we've seen in two years.
Smedes Rose: Great, Chris. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
StephenGrambling: Hi, thanks. I'd like to come at margins from maybe the perspective of your owners which is always key to driving that overall flywheel. How are you thinking owner margins will progress versus pre pandemic? And could you tie in how you envision the hotel experience will structurally change, whether it's longer stays, charging or opt-in for cleaning or reducing non-consumer-facing labor? And where do you see the greatest opportunity for investing back into your owners to improve the experience amidst some of these shifting preferences?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Good question, Steve and a little bit to unpack there but I'll sort of try to go in order. I think if you'd take a step back to the beginning of the pandemic, I think we've done a really good job leading -- we did a really good job in the pandemic leading the way with starting out early on, advocating for our owners, whether that was for government assistance or otherwise, being really flexible with standards as the business sort of fell apart a little bit. And through recovery, sort of similar to what Chris has been talking about of really taking the opportunity of COVID to drive improvement through our enterprise, we've been doing the same thing at the property level, right? So it's certain big things you mentioned by being innovative with reengineering our food and beverage and particularly, breakfast offerings, looking at housekeeping and opt-in there and then a bunch of little things across line item by line item sort of literally grinding through the P&Ls and standards with our owners to help them -- help the properties be more profitable through COVID and using that opportunity to make sure that, that profitability and those efficiencies stand going forward. Now people talk about we do need service recovery, right? It has been hard to hire labor. We do need to bring some of those service standards back. Obviously, everybody knows what's going on with inflation and wage inflation. But of course, the flip side of that on inflation is that helps on the revenue line, right? We reprice the rooms every night. If inflation is a headwind, on the cost side, it's going to be a tailwind on the revenue side and the revenue base is obviously bigger than the expense base. And so that ought to lead to higher margins coming out the other side. So when you put that all together, we think we can do a better job for customers, give them what they want, take away what they don't want and what they won't pay for and use driving revenue through an inflationary environment to get our owners to be higher-margin businesses coming out the other side.
Stephen Grambling: Okay, thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
PatrickScholes: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Kevin Jacobs: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Good morning. When I try to think about some things that have perhaps permanently changed or at least changed from 2019, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the degree of key money that you're giving today for new hotels under your brand, number one. And how have the franchise contracts changed? Are they more flexible today versus pre COVID, less flexible? I'd just like to hear your thoughts on those.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think I'll start with the second part. I mean really, there's nothing different about our franchise agreements now versus pre COVID. It's a very well -- it's a business that's been around for a long time. The protocols are established, the franchise documents, you can read them, they're public. They haven't really changed over time. I think when it comes to key money, I mean, you could see in our numbers this year that it's been sort of higher than it had been in the past. I think that's a function of a little bit of -- I don't think it's COVID versus pre COVID. It's a competitive environment out there so there's definitely competition. We're leading the way in growth and our competitors are trying to catch up to us. So that makes for competition. But the reality is, is our number of deals that have key money associated with them is about 10%. That's what it was pre COVID. That's what it is today. So that's been pretty consistent. And we've just been fortunate, over the last particularly a year or so, we've signed some really high-profile deals. I think about the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California. I think about Resorts World in Las Vegas, the deal we did in Cancun and Tulum, those have been deals that we've been working on for a really long time. They're very strategic. They happen to be a little bit higher key money associated with them than we're used to and so we've been a little bit higher. And that trend maybe continues for a little while longer. We have some strategic things in the hopper at the moment that I think might keep that number a little bit elevated over the course of 2022 and maybe even for a little while beyond that. But what I'd say sort of in closing and hopefully, that sort of covers it and Chris may want to add to this a little bit, is relative to our peers, I think we stack up really favorably in terms of what we've been deploying for capital to get to our level of growth, I think, has been exemplary.
Operator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Rich Hightower with Evercore. Please go ahead.
RichHightower: Hi, good morning, everybody.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Rich Hightower: So I want to go back to a portion of the prepared comments. And Chris, I think you mentioned it was STR's forecast. I know this is not a Hilton forecast but for business transient demand, I think you get to the low 90s as a percentage of pre-COVID levels this year. So again, not your forecast but I am wondering if you could take me through the building blocks in your mind as to perhaps how we might get to that level by the end of this year, especially in the context of hybrid workforces, work from home and so forth.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I -- yes, it is in our forecast but I do buy into it. And I think actually, it might be even better than that personally, my own opinion. I think there's a really good chance, on a run rate basis, that we will end up back at or above where we were in 2019 before the year is out. So why do I think that? One, there's a lot of pent-up demand. That obviously helps and Omicron created more pent-up demand because a lot of people didn't do trips. But I can't speak for the industry. I can speak for us. We're out talking to customers all the time, sort of large, medium, small. And what you find is like heretofore during the crisis, the largest corporate customers have been way off on travel. So they've been like 80 -- well, I'd say through the third and fourth quarter, they were 70% or 80% off still. But what happened is that SME, small, medium enterprises were out traveling like crazy. I've given these stats before on calls. Pre COVID, 80% of our business transient was SMEs. 20% of it or 10% of the overall business was large corporate. So it's not that we don't love them and we don't want them but we were never ultimately that dependent on that. So what happened in COVID for us is, again, I'm back to what I said in my earlier comments, we were, in March or April of 2020, saying like, "All right, what do we do? Where do we pivot? How do we retool our sales force, forgetting whatever business is out there?" And what we found, not surprisingly, is the large corporates disappeared but the SMEs were still out there, maybe not like they are now but they were out there more than others. Why? Because they're small and medium, they had to. Like, they'd die if they -- their business requires it and so they have to be out there. And so we pivoted a whole bunch of our infrastructure and sort of like retooled our entire sales force to make sure that we didn't abandon the large corporates and those relationships. We kept our entire sales team on payroll during the whole crisis which is unlike, I think, a bunch of our competitors. But we did say we need to like reorient how we're focusing our time. And we've done -- with all -- again, I feel like I'm patting us on the back, we've done a really good job. And so we have replaced, we think, probably already half of what that corporate business was that went away. And I think the corporate business is going to come back. You don't have to believe it's all going to come back but the idea is one plus one, I think, can equal three, right? Meaning pivoting even harder to have a larger demand base to put in the top of the funnel of SMEs, along with corporates coming back gradually, is just going to give us an opportunity to price demand in a way that I think will be superior to what we could price it before. Last comment I'd make is that people think about SMEs versus the big corporates and no offense to all the big corporates that are on this call but the reality is you guys pay less. So the SMEs, I mean, if you look at the rate structure of SMEs, it's like 15%-plus on average higher because the big corporates beat us up more, they beat everybody up and we discount more. So the reality is not only is there more of it that's been out there and we've retooled to go after more of it but the reality is it's at a higher price, too. And so that's why I believe in what STR is saying, we're better is because I do think throughout this year, as you release pent-up demand, given our access to SMEs that have been very robust and we have more of them. Corporates are definitely starting to come back, talk to every travel manager in the country which we do and they're coming back. When you put all those pieces together, I think it's pretty easy to believe. As you get to the -- particularly the second half of the year, you're going to be in a very different and a very positive environment.
Rich Hightower: All right, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
RichardClarke: Thanks very much for taking my questions. I just want to ask a question about the kind of construction environment. I noticed your percentage of pipeline that's under construction has dropped below 50% for the first time in quite a while. Is that just phasing? And does that feed into this year's guide on unit growth? Or does that mean we maybe can't expect a recovery in 2023 to return to the normal 6% to 7% takes a little bit longer?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Richard, I think, look, that's a slight decrease, almost a rounding error in terms of our amount under construction. It really sort of rounded to half before it rounds to half now. If you look at the industry data per STR, it's down actually a lot more than that. And so we're doing a really good job of both getting and keeping things under construction. And I'd say the way to think about the trajectory is we actually think we'll start more rooms this year than we started last year. Now in the U.S. which is our largest market, we think we have one more year where it's going to decline slightly and 2022 is probably the bottom. And that does play into our forward-looking forecast. And of course, that's just a function of largely input cost, right? If construction costs overall are sort of up year-over-year at the moment in the mid-teens, raw material cost and labor cost inflation is not something that should surprise anybody on this call, that sort of a thing going on globally, especially in the U.S. And so that does all play into our outlook. And so we've actually never said publicly when we think we'll get back to our prior 6% to 7% level. But given what's going on now, it probably takes two or three years to get back to that level, we think. Again, this year we'll be -- 2021 was the bottom globally for starts. This year, 2022 in the U.S., we think we'll recover from there. You've got to start them to deliver them, right? So we have to start to recover to be able to get back to that prior level of net unit growth. And so you are seeing that sort of affect our outlook both for this year and beyond. And then I guess the last thing I'd say on that is, even with everything that's been going on in the world, for now, a two year pandemic with the world blowing sky high, we're still delivering plus-5% net unit growth. We still think we'll deliver at that rate through this development lag that's going to come from the pandemic and then we'll recover from there. We think that's actually pretty good evidence of the resiliency of the business and the resiliency of our ability to grow.
Richard Clarke: Very helpful. Thanks so much.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
DavidKatz: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate all of the detail so far. I wanted to ask about the aspect of the fees which is non-RevPAR-driven, like your royalties and credit card fees, etcetera. Is there any sort of insights or help that you can offer us as we think about modeling out the next year or two as to what those might grow and any puts and takes?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, David, I think we've talked about this in the past. We get that it's a little bit hard to model sort of specifically what's going on. Our non-RevPAR-driven fees cover a bunch of different things, obviously, our co-brand credit card and our license fees from HGV being the largest part of that but we have other things in there like residential development fees and the like. And we've said this before, that's been less volatile, right? So it declined less than RevPAR declined during COVID. And now at this point, it's growing less than RevPAR. I think for 2021, it grew about 2/3 of the rate of RevPAR and that's probably a decent way to think about it going forward. It's hard to say, right? It depends on how those things perform and what goes on. But I think it's going to continue to be a decent growth rate and additive to our fees. For 2021, it was actually higher, our non-RevPAR fees or I think Chris, you might have said this earlier so sorry if I'm repeating it but our non-RevPAR fees were higher than they were in 2019. And our credit card program is performing quite nicely. I think just a few stats to give you some color. Our account acquisitions were up 45% last year. Our spend was up about 1/3 year-over-year. And so really strong performance but again, at a lower rate than overall RevPAR because RevPAR is growing at a really high rate in recovery. So hopefully...
David Katz: So growth but at a lesser rate?
Kevin Jacobs: At the moment.
David Katz: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
RobinFarley: Great. Thank you. Originally, my question was going to be to clarify the comments, the opening remarks about transient midweek nights for all future periods down only 4% because that seemed like that number was sort of too strong a recovery. But I guess really based on -- you really already commented already on the growth in the small and medium. So I don't know if you have anything else to add on that, only being down 4%. I would think just even the booking window being shorter would make that hard to be at that good of a number. So I'm thinking...
Chris Nassetta: No, I don't. I don't, Robin, I don't have anything to add other than, yes, it's short. The very nature of advanced bookings and transient only gives you a window so far out in time. It's a relatively short window. But those are the stats. And I gave them to you because I think it is indicative not only of the strength that's building in that environment but the change from literally the beginning of the year when Omicron was a very big thing to a world where Omicron is becoming a lot less of a thing and we're getting to more endemic stages of COVID-19.
Robin Farley: And then just for a follow-up, if you could put a little more color around -- you mentioned reinstating the dividend in Q2 and returning to share repurchase in Q2. Can you talk about, will you sort of start at a dividend payout or dividend level probably lower than pre pandemic initially? Or just sort of give us some thoughts around how you're thinking about that balance as you restart that return to shareholders.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. As I've said a couple of times, we're intending to do it in Q2. We have not formally declared a dividend so we haven't made a final decision. But I think the way to think about it and our intention at this point is to reinstate the dividend at the exact same level we had it before, same $0.15 a share which is where we were before to go back to where we were and then use the bulk of our free cash flow and otherwise to re-implement our share repurchase program. I know there are different views in the world about this. Our view, my view has always been that having some modest dividend is helpful. It does open the universe of investors up a bit to us and we proved that pre COVID and we've talked to a lot of shareholders and I think still have that view. But the way to drive the best long-term returns for all of us that are shareholders is to have the bulk of our program be in the form of share buybacks. And so that's what we thought pre COVID. We did a whole bunch of work to see, is there anything going on? Jill's nodding her head because she did a lot of it. Is there anything that's changed in the world or with our shareholder base currently that would lead us to a different conclusion? And we have not. We do not believe there is. So that's what we'll do; we'll get started. I think the way to think -- we obviously haven't given guidance generally but I think the way to think about it is we'll start out at least thinking about it at a minimum being the free cash flow that we're going to produce this year. And the way to think about that, I think, directionally is back to my margin point, while we're not back fully recovered by a pretty decent margin yet to 2019, certainly as you look at the full year 2022, because we have -- the business is performing better, we've done these structural things that I described to drive higher margins, our free cash flow is actually pretty much back this year, we think, to 2019 levels. So we'll start at a minimum with that and go from there.
Robin Farley: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question is from Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Please go ahead.
ChadBeynon: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I believe your conversion NUG component of total growth has been in the 20% range. Can you help update us on this in terms of where it was for 2021? And then for 2022 against your NUG guide, how should we think about converts and what that will be as a percentage being slightly offset by higher, I guess, ground-up growth?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks, Chad. Look, I think it will be -- I mean, the short answer, the crisp answer is I think it will be consistent, right? It's been about 20%. We're actually doing more conversions. We've given you some of the stats but our approvals, our openings for the full year were up 13% year-over-year. Actually, our approvals for full year last year were up 42% in conversion. So we're having nice growth in conversions and we're doing more but we're also doing more ground-up development, right? And so the denominator in that equation is growing as well. And so will it be slightly higher going for the next couple of years? It could be, depends a little bit on how a couple of big deals break that can move that percentage a little bit here or there. But I would think about it sort of as being pretty consistent around 20% or the low 20s of deliveries. And I think it's actually a good news story across the board. I mean we -- in the Americas, for 2021, we signed almost half of the conversion deals that were done in the Americas. And so we're doing a lot of conversions. But the reason it's not sort of spiking from 20% to 30% is we're delivering a lot of new development as well.
Chad Beynon: Thank you very much.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks very much, everybody, for joining today. Obviously, continuing on with recovery. I think we are, as I've said a couple of times, hopefully, getting through the Omicron variant and very rapidly to an endemic stage of this. We're obviously optimistic as we look to the second quarter and the second half of the year and overall, beyond that. And so thanks for the time. We'll look forward to updating you on trends that, I think, will be a lot better the next time we talk. So, thanks and have a great day.
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-10-27 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin. 
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.
 In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com.
 This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. 
 With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. 
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report another quarter of very solid results that demonstrate continued recovery and the resiliency of our business model. 
 Increases in vaccination rates and consumer spending, coupled with improving business activity, continued to drive solid travel demand throughout the summer and into the fall. As global borders reopen and the travel environment recovers, we remain extremely encouraged by people's desire to travel and connect more than ever before. 
 In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 99% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down roughly 19%, improving 17 percentage points versus the second quarter, with system-wide rates down just 2.5% versus 2019. Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $519 million, up 132% year-over-year and down 14% versus 2019. Performance was primarily driven by strong leisure trends with leisure room nights roughly in line with 2019 level, with leisure rates exceeding 2019 levels. 
 Business travel continued to gain momentum with midweek occupancy and rates improving meaningfully versus the second quarter. In the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels. Group continued to lag but showed significant sequential improvement versus the second quarter, boosted by strength in social events. For the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter.
 Overall system-wide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85% with rates just shy of prior peaks. As expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remained solid. Both August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post-Labor Day as offices and schools reopen. These trends improved modestly into October with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks. Roughly 40% of system-wide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date. 
 Additionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019. With loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand.
 TSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers. Additionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter. With roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand. This demand is higher rated, the more resilient -- resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up. 
 On the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper. Additionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers. 
 Turning to development. We added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. Conversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings. Year-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors. 
 Our performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world. It also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come. 
 During the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market. To date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class. 
 Following our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties. We look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China. 
 We also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launch just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development. 
 Our luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House LXR in the Seychelles. Marking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the ROKU KYOTO. 
 In the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Driving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California. The 300-room hotel is expected to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development. With approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities. For the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years. 
 For our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical. We were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company. This feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key. 
 Additional technology enhancements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades. Gold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app. We continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels. In the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year. Honors members accounted for 59% of occupancy with the U.S. at 66%, just 2 points below 2019 levels. 
 During the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own. And like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller. In the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S. with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year. And thanks to our exciting partnership with Mars Petcare, we're offering new pet-focused programming and benefits. Our guests are eager to travel with their furry little friends. And by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system. 
 As the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests. That's why I am particularly proud that, last week, we were named the #3 World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. After 6 consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list. We truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future. 
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter. 
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year. Results reflect the broader recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78. 
 Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019. Robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July. Trends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality. U.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels. 
 In the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period. Canada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans. 
 In Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Travel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosened. 
 In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe. 
 In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country. China has recovered steadily into October with occupancy nearing 60% for the month. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics. 
 Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net unit 6.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
 Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. 
 Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]
 Chad, can we have our first question, please? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. 
Carlo Santarelli: Chris, you gave a lot of color, as did you, Kevin, in your prepared remarks. But one thing I just wanted to kind of ask around was how you guys are seeing or believe the cadence of business transient travel will play out here in the fourth quarter and how kind of -- or how you're thinking about the sequencing through 2022? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean great question, Carlo, and obviously one everybody is interested in. So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which you know I like to do occasionally, the way I would see it is, as we have been seeing through the third quarter and what I think we'll see in the fourth quarter is a continued uptick in business transient travel, I think that will come from all segments of business strange. But again, probably continue to be led this -- in this year in the fourth quarter by small and medium SME, small and medium enterprises. I don't think you'll see a huge pickup, but I think you'll see a modest pickup. 
 At the same time, just because people are increasingly back in offices and kids are definitely, mostly, if not entirely, back in school, I think you'll see a little bit of a tick-down in leisure business. Now the weekends will continue to rage, I think. The weekends have been extraordinary, but the midweek leisure travel will continue to tick down. And I think those 2 will largely offset each other in the fourth quarter. 
 I think group will remain pretty consistent. Obviously, we had a big uptick in the summer, and then Delta variant sort of slid out the momentum a little bit on group. People think -- there's advanced planning. People have to spend money. And so while there's plenty of group occurring, it's really largely sports and social. At this point, I think that continues about -- like what we've seen in the third quarter into the fourth because people are -- all the pent-up demand is there, but people are sort of advanced planning more into next year, just to sort of finally get through Delta and hopefully to the endemic stage of COVID, which sort of feels like is we're in the process of doing as we speak. 
 As we think about 2022 with all those segments, what I would say is I think leisure will remain elevated relative to historical standards. Obviously, my belief is kids will still be back in school. More offices are going to open. So midweek, we'll get back to more normalized levels. But I think the weekends, people want to be out. Turns out they didn't like being locked in their closets and basements and attics, and so they're going to want to get out. And we've seen this pattern of very high demand on weekends. I think that will continue. And so I think on the margin, leisure will be -- continue to be stronger than we've historically seen sort of in pre-COVID times. 
 I think business transient will continue to move up. You'll continue to see great strength in small and medium enterprises, which aren't fully back to pre-COVID but getting pretty close. And my own belief is you'll start to see the large corporates step into the game. I mean they're already in the game, but they're still sort of like 40% off of '19 levels. I think you'll see a step change in the large corporates which will contribute, along with SMEs, to continued upticks in business transient.
 And then I think group is clearly going to be better next year than this year. I think reality is the first quarter probably is typically a slow group quarter. I don't think it will be different in that way. I think people are going to want to sort of clear the mechanism of getting past the winter, just because concerns of flu seasons and all that, given what we've all been through. But I think as you get into Qs 2, 3 and 4, both booked business and realized business on the group side are going to be better. 
 So I think 2022 is sizing up to be -- I think the fourth quarter is sizing up to be fairly similar to the third quarter, and I think 2022 is sizing up to be another big step forward on recovery to more normalized times. 
Operator: And the next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan. 
Joseph Greff: You guys were -- had some interesting comments on the development side, and obviously positive there. Chris, when do you think hotel construction starts to trough? When do you think new signings peak or have they? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense, so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave you a sense in our prepared comments that we think we'll be in the mid-single-digits for the next couple of years. Obviously, that requires a lot of work. It requires signing deals, starting construction that then ultimately it lands in our NUG numbers.
 I think when you look back 2 years from now at this period of time, I am of the mind and reasonably confident that what you will see is the trough in deal signings was last year. As Kevin mentioned, we're going to be up in the mid- to high single-digits in signings this year, we think. I mean we're not done with the year. We always have a good flurry of activity at the end, but we got a lot of it on the books, and so we're pretty damn confident we're going to be up nicely. And I don't see why next year, given what's going on in the environment in terms of -- particularly operating recovery, pricing power, which I'm sure we'll come to, I'll do it maybe in another question, that we're going to see more deals signed next year. 
 So I think last year was probably, in my mind, the trough for signings. I think this year, for those same exact reasons, will be the trough in construction starts. Starts always will lag the signings a little bit. We're definitely going to be a little bit modestly down in signings this year after being down last year. Our expectation is that will turn around next year, and that's why we think we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digits for a couple of years and then back on track being in the 6% to 7% range, just because, starting this year, we're signing more. Starting next year, we're starting more. We're obviously filling in a lot. You saw in the second quarter, 1/3 of our NUG was conversion, so we're filling in. And so between all of those factors, we think, ultimately, when we get out past a couple of years, we're back. The goal is to be back in the 6% to 7%. And I think given what I see in the environment that we feel pretty good about that. 
 I mean -- and I'll probably stop there with the only comment being things are going to come back faster than prior recoveries here, and that's because the thing that's very different than every other cycle I've seen in my 40 years, and I'll leave it at this, and somebody, I'm sure, will have a question, is just pricing power. I mean the reality is, typically, it's like a grind to build back occupancy, and rate lags significantly. Rate is leading the charge, and that, obviously, flows really nicely. We've done a bunch of things, as you know, and we've talked about a lot to create higher-margin businesses out of all of these brands. And when you flush all that through, even with labor costs up and all of those fun things, these are higher-margin businesses. And part of this is just we're in an inflationary environment. And guess what? We can reprice our product every second of every day. We're a very good hedge in that way to inflation, and we're being very thoughtful about how we're pricing our product. 
 And so I think when we all look back on it, this will be a faster recovery on the development side than we've seen in prior cycles. And -- so I think we're going to be back in -- on a very nice trajectory next year. 
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. 
Shaun Kelley: Chris, I think there were a couple of fat pitches there on the pricing environment, so maybe I'll behave, if you could. But I guess my twist would be could you give us a little color specifically on the business pricing side? I think we all see that the leisure rates are exceptional. And so maybe your thoughts on how long leisure can continue pricing like it is, your thoughts on the recovery of business pricing. And then any headwind from large corporates? You've done a great job of delineating small and large, so how much of a headwind is large corporate? Does that price any differently? Is that a factor at all? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. A great question. Yes, I did sort of serve that up. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised I'm getting asked. Listen, you embedded in the question is part of the answer. But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic but say what I say a lot when I'm asked this question. The laws of economics are alive and well, right? And that's what's going on. Why is leisure so strong in rate? Why are we able to price above historically high levels? Because there are crazy amounts of demand. Like our weekend demand is off the chart. We're running 85% to 90% system-wide in the U.S. on the weekends, and we're pricing over '19 levels, obviously, because we have a lot of demand. 
 I do think that will -- that leisure pricing power will continue because, what I said before, I believe that leisure demand is going to remain at elevated levels, particularly on the weekends, and that that's going to give us nice pricing power. Even though, obviously, the recovery in business transient has lagged, as I said in the quarter, we were 75%, but it's sort of a tale of 2 cities, which is I implied it a little bit. You have -- the big corporates which are still 40% off, but then you have small and medium which are only maybe 10%. You could even argue maybe 5% or 10% off. And so we have a fair amount of pricing power in the biggest piece -- in the biggest segments, and they are less price sensitive. 
 So broadly, your biggest -- it's not everybody. Your biggest corporate customers can end up with sort of off bar, 10% or 20%. Small and medium might end up at 5% or 7%. So that's why we were working so hard on accessing more of that demand base pre-COVID and has helped us during COVID. 
 And so when you put it all together and you look at like even in the quarter, we're at 90% of -- in business transient combined, we're already at 90% of 2019 levels, even though we still have a ways to go to build back demand. So I feel -- it's a long ways to go. I feel pretty good about where that's going because we're going to keep pushing on small and medium. That's almost back. My guess is that will exceed prior levels. And then the corporates are going to come in. And that's going to allow us to put more on the top of the funnel to price -- have more demand, allows us to price more aggressively. 
 I think when it's all said and done, if we were 80-20 before, and I don't know exactly where it will be, but my suspect we will probably never go back to 80-20 in reality because we have been successful at finding other segments that we think are going to be there. They're going to be more resilient, and they're going to be higher priced. So my guess is we will be managing to probably a 90-10 world or something like that. But we do think pricing power is not in business transient what it is in leisure, but it's not far off. 
 And then group, group is sort of in the year, for the year similar to business transient. But as you look forward, because there's so much pent-up demand, and as I've talked about at least on the last call, we're actually pricing already over '19 levels. So there's pricing power. And you'd say, well, "Wow, if group is still way off from a consumer revenue point of view, what's going on?" Well, what's going on is group is very -- the one segment that books weigh in advance, and there's a limited amount of meeting space in the world and in the United States. We happen to have a lot of it. I mean there are a few of us that are very big players in that space. A lot of people want it. And so the reality is, again, laws of economics are alive and well. People want it. There's not enough of it. You have huge pent-up demand that's sort of getting all -- events that didn't happen, that need to happen, new events. And that's pushing into next year. 
 And so even though, in the moment, group revenues aren't what they were, on a forward-looking basis, there is a good amount of pricing power, which is why on a -- all of our advanced bookings in the next year are pricing over '19 levels at this point. 
 So again, back to the bait I put out there, I guess, it's unusual. Like I hate to admit how long I've been doing this but a long time. I guess I said it before. But it just hasn't really happened this way. Now there are a lot of reasons. We're better, right? We got much more sophisticated revenue management systems. We're much more on top of it, I think, than we've ever been. Obviously, we're in a more inflationary environment broadly. Thank you, Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress, for fiscal and monetary stimulus. We could debate transitory or otherwise, but those things are translating into, broadly, a more highly inflationary environment. And that applies to us, too, and that obviously is helping from a pricing power point of view. 
Operator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. 
Thomas Allen: So a strategic question. You talked in your prepared remarks about starting to open franchising for Hilton Garden Inn in China. I know that was an interesting change because with Hampton Inn, you did a master franchise agreement. Can you just talk about the rationale? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. It's very straightforward. We've done 2. The one you mentioned with Plateno was the Hampton Inn. And then more recently, I mentioned in my comments, we just actually opened our first Home2 Suites by Hilton in China on the road to doing 1,000 of them with Country Garden, one of the largest players in China, which is another master license agreement. So we've done those 2. 
 Never say never. I'm not saying -- but the idea was to really help -- get help from very large local players that knew how to garner scale very quickly to help build our network effect in China and then ultimately come back in with our other brands and do it ourselves. And so that's exactly what we're doing with Hilton Garden Inn. We obviously have a massive franchise system here in the United States and frankly in Europe now, where the bulk of the business here is franchised. Increasingly, I think we're now -- the majority of the business in Europe is franchised. It's been a much smaller part of the business in China and in Asia Pacific, so we historically haven't had the same level of resources. 
 And so what we've done during COVID is made some strategic investments to build out more infrastructure so that we can take other brands in our -- of our 18 brand -- a family of brands and do it ourselves. 
 And so we're trying to be very sort of balanced and balance all the risks associated with our expansion around the world, and we think it's great to work with third parties. We love the Country Garden folks and Plateno. They've been incredibly important partners, will continue to be for a long, long time. But it's also important that we have that skill set ourselves in franchising. Is it -- while it's similar in China, it's not exactly the same. And so we've learned a lot and I think built a -- we're building a good infrastructure and a good muscle set to be able to take a bunch of other brands and do just what we've done here in the U.S., Europe and other places. 
Thomas Allen: And sorry, just a follow-up to this question. Any updated thinking on the potential TAM for these select service brands in China? 
Christopher Nassetta: I didn't hear the question. 
Thomas Allen: How many of these hotels do you think you can open in China? What's the addressable market? 
Christopher Nassetta: TAM. Okay, you're going tech on me. I love that. I love that. We do look at TAM. I mean I'm not going to give you there. It's thousands, right? Think of it in the following way. We have limited service hotels in the U.S., probably 4,500. We have a population of 320 million people. You have 1.3 billion people there, so there's no limit in my lifetime at least, probably not, you're younger than me, but I'm not that old, so probably not in your lifetime either. Thousands and thousands. You could easily have 10,000 or 20,000 or more, so I think there's growth opportunities in the mid-market as far as the eye can see in China. 
 So while we have done some TAM work in China every time we come back and look at the numbers, they're just -- they're off the charts. There are no rational limitations given what our footprint is, what the population is and the growth in their middle class. 
Operator: Next question will be from Smedes Rose from Citi. 
Bennett Rose: Chris, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what your owners are telling you about labor costs in the U.S. Kind of how they're handling restaffing and maybe just the sort of idea of slim down the operating models versus trying to get back to... 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Smedes, I had a hard time hearing some of that, but I think I captured it, the labor costs and what owners are telling us. It's obviously been a big issue and one that we spent a lot of time on, a complex issue in terms of what's sort of underneath the problem. 
 What I would say is, obviously, there is no one owner group. The different owners in different parts of the country and the world, for that matter, have different views. But if I sort of homogenize it all, which is hard to do, but if I do it in my head, I would say while it's still a very difficult issue, we've started to see easing in terms of access to labor. I think we have ways to go. There are a bunch of things we're doing to help from a technology point of view to access pools of labor that maybe we hadn't accessed historically. But broadly, more labor is coming back in, and some of those pressures are easing. Obviously, labor is more expensive pretty much everywhere. I think that's a reality. Where it settles out, I think it's a little early to know, but I think it is sort of settling down as people are gradually coming back into the workforce. 
 I think the end of the question, which is a really important one, which I sort of touched on earlier in one of my other filibusters, was how is it going to look for owners on the other side? And again, it's hard -- some owners -- depends on location, product, 1,000 factors. But broadly -- and we're already seeing it. I think I said this. Broadly, I think when we get to the other side of this, across the system, margins are going to be higher, and you know why. With input costs going up, labor costs going up and all of those fun things, they're going to be -- margins are going to be higher because rate is going to be a lot higher ultimately when we get past this for all the reasons I talked about in terms of the pricing power that we have and the broader inflationary environment. That's very helpful to the business. 
 At the same time, particularly in the mega categories, which is where the bulk of the hotels are with our ownership community, we did a bunch of really important work and did a lot of testing and learning and made a bunch of changes in the hotels. In the end, we think, to create a better experience for our customers, but to do it in a more efficient way to drive higher margins. So we're pretty confident. And we have pretty good evidence, which I'll talk about that, even with the -- when labor comes back and you have to pay labor more, given where rate structures are going to be in most places and given the efficiencies that we've been able to garner, that these are -- our owners are going to end up with higher-margin businesses. 
 And by the way, many, many of them, not all of them. So for those that haven't gotten there that are listening, keep the faith. But many, many owners are already there. Some of it is unsustainable, meaning part of it is they can't get enough labor, and so they don't have enough people, so their labor costs are unusually low. But even in places where they are able to get the labor back for the reasons I described, meaning more efficiencies on our standards and pricing power on the top line, they're driving very good margins. 
 And so we've had -- the owners are -- have been in pain. I don't want to minimize it. There's still many of them in a lot of pain, but we're doing our level best to get them to the other side and make sure their businesses are stronger, both because that's what we should do, as a fiduciary to them, but also, ultimately, if we want to continue to be able to grow, we have to give them an investment alternative that continues to makes sense from a return point of view. And so we're hyper focused on it. 
 And I would say, I feel really good. As I said, I think the development cycle will flip faster than we've seen in prior cycles for these reasons. I just think that the economics -- the laws of economics are alive and well. I've said it now twice or three times, that if people can get great returns because of the conditions, macro and micro, macro world going on micro the things we're doing, then they're going to want to build us more hotels. And obviously, with the signings being up in the mid -- double -- mid-teens to plus, we think that's pretty good prima facie evidence that that's what's going on. 
Operator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. 
Bennett Rose: This is a bit of a multi-parter, but you mentioned that the majority of the pipeline is outside the U.S. Can you just remind us of what that split maybe looks like within some of the major markets? How the contribution from international room growth could compare and contrast to the U.S. as we translate NUG to fees? And then if you could just talk to any kind of incremental signing opportunities that you're seeing that surfaced in new markets as a result of the pandemic that could be longer lasting. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Stephen. It's Kevin. I'll sort of try to take those in order. I think that the mix of rooms under construction is just over -- so kind of between 60% and 65% outside the U.S. versus inside the U.S. I think in terms of -- look, we're always trying to enter new markets. I think we have 20 something -- 25 to 30 new countries embedded in the pipeline that we don't have today, right? So we're always trying to enter new markets. I'm not sure really anything of that -- any of that has been opened up by the pandemic. I think it's just sort of the course of the growth of our business over time.
 And then trajectory really has a lot to do with how places are coming out of the pandemic, meaning we've been -- even though there's been spikes up and down in RevPAR in China, for instance, as they go into lockdowns, the development trajectory there has actually continued to be pretty solid and continued to improve. But in places like Europe where, traditionally, it's more of a face-to-face development environment, the less people have been able -- the less our teams and the owners have been able to get on planes and move around country to country, those signings have lagged a little bit. So I actually see that as a tailwind coming out of the pandemic, whereas there's a lot of pent-up demand for development in EMEA broadly. And I think that it's just going to require a little bit more mobility to surface that. 
 But the rest of it is just, over time, as Chris has talked about this, as you have a rapidly developing middle class with more demand for mid-market products, you're going to see a little bit more of that demand over time. I mean the full-service business is not dead by any means. But you're just going to see, on the margin, the capital flows more to the limited-service hotels. So we're going to do more deals where the capital flows. 
 And then as we bring franchising, which has been very successful for us -- Chris went through it, so I won't go through it again. But as we bring franchising to different parts of the world, particularly Asia Pacific, we're just going to do more franchise deals over time. You're not going to see, I don't think, big step changes. You're just going to see a gradual growth over time in more limited-service mix and more franchise mix. Did that cover all the parts? 
Stephen Grambling: One very quick follow-up. So from a net unit growth standpoint then, I guess, the fees that you're getting from the international market maybe ends up being a little bit lower because of the RevPAR. But on the flip side, it sounds like you're doing more direct, so there's a potential for that to actually improve within that mix. Is that true? 
Kevin Jacobs: Well, yes. Mathematically, right, the lower price points, it will blend in over time. Again, it will not change dramatically. We've modeled it every which way, and it's really hard to make that per room number move. But mathematically, it has to move over time. And the reality is, look, it's very high margin. It's 100% margin. Once we have scale in these parts of the world, it's a 100% margin and infinite yield. And so we'll take it. 
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley with UBS. 
Robin Farley: Great. A lot of my questions have been asked already. One, just to circle back, and I hope I didn't miss this in the opening comment. I -- the operator pulled me out of the call for a minute. But when you talked about group and the expectation that there'll be a lot of pent-up volume for '22, can you give us a sense of where -- and I think that is a reasonable expectation but kind of where the group on the books for next year is versus '19. Like in other words, it's likely to be higher or maybe not in Q1, but kind of how that's pacing with what you have on the books for group for '22. And I don't know if you have it by quarter or first half, second half. 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I mean it would be weighted to Qs 2 through 4, first of all, for the reasons I covered in a prior answer. Just meaning people want to get through the winter, one. Two, the first quarter is never a big group quarter. So you put those 2 things together, and it trends heavily to Qs 2, 3 and 4. 
 We're in the 75%, 80% on the books, which is about consistent with where we were in the last quarter. And what happened is, I think if you hadn't had the Delta variant spike, we'd probably be somewhat further along. But you had the Delta variant sort of slow -- they cooled off the advanced bookings on the group side, which have now picked back up. 
 The other thing going on, of course, is we want to -- we do believe there's going to be a lot of group potential, particularly in Qs 2, 3 and 4. And we don't want to commit. There's a level of -- lack of desire on our part to commit too much space when we know that there'll be a lot of pricing power, so it's sort of a bit of a delicate balancing act. 
Operator: And the next question will be from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. 
Richard Clarke: I just noticed on your cost reimbursement revenue has exceeded your -- the cost reimbursement expense for the first time really since the pandemic began. And you've lost obviously -- non-underlying, but you've lost about sort of $500 million through that Delta as the pandemic has gone on. Is this the beginning potentially of you being able to claw that back? And could this be a sort of boost to cash flow over the next few quarters? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Richard. It's -- I wouldn't necessarily describe it as a clawback. I think what happened early in the pandemic is you had sort of -- rough numbers, you had revenue go down kind of 85% to 90% overnight. And we did a really good job of taking the expenses down, but we can only take expenses down, call it, 60% or 65%. So we basically were funding from our balance sheet the -- all the commercial engines and the websites and all the funded part of the business. And so those things really are giant co-ops. They're going to break even over time. 
 So now what you're seeing is revenues -- and by the way, all the fees, all the sources of funds for those programs are funded as a percentage of revenue. So as revenue is climbing, our receipts are going up. And we will ultimately bring those funds back to breakeven, and we will recover those deficits. And at the moment, you're seeing it as surpluses. But I wouldn't necessarily think of it as clawbacks. Those funds run surpluses and deficits from time to time. So I think you'll see it run a surplus for a little while. And yes, the cash is commingled. But it's our owner's money at the end of the day, and we spend it all on them. 
Operator: Next question will be from Bill Crow from Raymond James. 
William Crow: Chris, I hope you don't mind. I'm going to challenge you a little bit on the leisure outlook for 2022. And I'm just wondering how much risk there really is when we think about the combination of the return to office, the absence of government checks, much higher costs from inflation for the consumer and probably a pretty considerable pent-up outbound international demand. So I'm thinking about your comments on rate and leisure and weekday leisure in particular. Are we at risk kind of setting ourselves up for disappointment next year? 
Christopher Nassetta: I don't think so. You heard my views, so you can -- we can have a debate about it, but I don't think so for the following reason. I think the midweek is already being bled out now, so I don't -- I think most people -- most kids are back in school. It's in truncate's mobility even if people are in the office, so while more offices are going to open through the rest of this year and into next year. What we've seen in the pattern of leisure during the midweek, it's our -- we've sort of washed out a large part of that already. I may be wrong, but I believe the weekends are going to remain strong, simply because I still think, if you look at the $3 trillion of incremental savings during COVID, there's a long way to go to spend it all. And I think people still want to do -- they want the experiences that they were starved for, and now it gets concentrated more on weekends, which is what we're seeing now. I believe that will continue. 
 I don't -- so the net of it is, my view, just to be clear, is that relative to a normalized like '19 level of leisure demand, I think we're getting back more towards that with a little bit better because I think the weekends are going to be a little bit better. I'm not -- I agree with you. I don't think that the midweek leisure is going to be raging, and that's not sort of built into my expectations.
 In terms of outbound, yes, the world is opening up. But then there's inbound, too. Particularly for the cities that -- the big cities, top 25 markets that historically depend on 20% of their business from inbound international travel, they've had 0. And starting next week or week after, the floodgates are going to open on that. So yes, you're going to have some people going outbound, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to come see America that is going to offset that and particularly with the top 25 markets, broadly, but particularly in the top 25 markets that are going to come in. 
 Again, we're still in the middle of budgets, and we're still debating all of this and where it ends up. There's -- I'm giving you my opinion and my sense of it. I think leisure will remain -- when we wake up next year and the following year, and you compare it to the amount of leisure business that we did, which was probably 25% or 30% of our overall segmentation pre-COVID, I think it will be higher than that. And I think it will be higher than that because people want to get out more. There's plenty of incremental savings in the world that has not gotten anywhere close to being spent. And the weekend business, while we were doing better on weekends than we had historically, I think it will stay even more elevated than that. 
William Crow: Great. And Chris, can I give you the opportunity to maybe update us on the timing for potential capital returns and buybacks? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. We don't have anything new. But to repeat what I said last time, we are very interested in getting back to returning capital. We firmly believe in our capital allocation strategy pre-COVID, which was we were producing a lot of free cash flow that we didn't -- we can continue to grow the business in an industry-leading way without the use of much of it. And we wanted, as a result, to give it back to our shareholders because there was no reason for us to hoard it or do dumb things with it. And disciplined capital allocation, we believe, is a hallmark of long term, delivering great returns for shareholders. 
 Our -- my belief hasn't been changed through COVID. The only thing that changed is we didn't have a lot of free cash flow during the heat of the crisis. We are obviously getting past that. We are cash flow positive. We want to just give it a little bit more time, as I said on the last call, sort of finish out the year. And if things go as we expect and consistent with what we have been seeing, we're going to reinstate a return of capital program in the first half of next year. And my guess is it will look quite similar. I mean, we're still having that discussion with our Board who obviously has a say in it. But I think if I had to pick a line, I think it will look a lot like what we were doing pre-COVID. And we're very focused on it and very anxious to get back to it. And so I direct you, I would say first half of next year. 
Operator: The next question will be from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. 
Charles Scholes: A question on labor costs and specifically Hilton Corporation's labor costs. Any change in your expectations for G&A and trajectory of your G&A versus what you said in the past? And correct me if I'm wrong, I have in my notes here. You've talked about sensitivity of EBITDA to RevPAR, EBITDA growth about 1.3x RevPAR growth. Is that still your thoughts on that trajectory? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think what we said, Patrick, is that in the context of when RevPAR levels are elevated, the RevPAR growth is elevated the way it is, it will be in that zone. I think it should be -- obviously 90% of the business is from fees, that should be about 1:1 as things normalize. We think we can do a little bit better with net unit growth, cost discipline, license fees, things like that, maybe a little bit better than 1:1 over time. But I think the 1.3x is more of when RevPAR is elevated. 
 And then no change -- short answer is no change in our views on G&A, right? We've been very disciplined. I think we -- what we've said to you guys is that cash G&A ought to be down this year in the mid- to high teens from 2019 levels. We actually might do a little bit better than that this year because we've got pretty good cost discipline. GAAP is different, but you got a lot of moving pieces. Particularly in the third quarter this year, we're lapping over some of the write-downs of stock comp from last year.
 And then going forward, again, no real change. I think we all understand that, with more business activity is going to come a little bit more expense. And just like we're in an inflationary environment that's going to help on the revenue side, we're going to be paying people a little bit more along the way. But we do think we're going to maintain discipline. The changes that we've made to our structure are going to hold going forward, and we feel -- still feel the same way. 
Operator: The next question will be from Vincent Ciepiel (sic) [ Vince Ciepiel ] with Cleveland Research Company. 
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Question on distribution. You guys have done a nice job driving direct business with, I think, loyalty contribution around 60% pre-COVID. But I know OTA contribution fell from high teens to about low doubles while reducing commissions along that path, so a lot of exciting things happening on the distribution front. I'm curious, on the other side of this, how you're thinking about OTA contribution as well as how high that loyalty contribution can get. 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, really good question. I don't feel really a lot different than I did pre-COVID. I mean we believe there's an efficient frontier, and we've calculated it as best we can by individual market property, what -- based on what they can deliver at that price point versus what we can deliver, how do we deliver the highest index -- the highest revenue for the lowest distribution cost. And we do believe, and that's why we've had a good relationship with the OTAs, that they play a part in that. It's traditionally been in the sort of 10% or 12% range, and that's historically where we've been. During COVID, that went up. 
 But if -- we wanted it to go up. We partnered, I think, quite successfully with our OTA partners, knowing that the biggest segment of demand that was out there for most of COVID was lower-rated leisure, which is what they are particularly good at, non-loyalty -- nonloyal-type customer base. And so it has crept -- it crept up a bit but not too terribly much, and we've already seen that sort of peak and start to come down. 
 And so while we'll look at the efficient frontier as we always do periodically and maybe if you think leisure is going to be a little bit higher component overall, maybe it goes up a little, but not much, and it didn't move that much. So the net of all that is I think when we wake up in a couple of years, it will look an awful lot like it did before. And we obviously feel good about the contractual terms that we have with the OTAs now and our ability to continue to have attractive terms going forward. 
 As it relates to Honors, the -- my Honors team is probably listening, and they may need a diaper for this. But we're -- we maxed out in the 63%, 64% system-wide. And we're already in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared comments, not that far off of that. Globally, we're coming back as our more of -- number one, we've accessed more travelers that weren't loyal. So some of these leisure travelers that we didn't have access to, we've now accessed. And more of our core customer is getting back on the road. We're getting back to normal. 
 But I'm not going to put a number out there because I'll give a heart -- my team will have a heart attack. But I believe that there is a lot of room to grow. I think the super majority -- if we're doing our job, the super majority of our customers want to be Honors members. It's a proposition that they get benefits that you just don't get, and they're meaningful. And you can go through them. They get discounts. They get technology. They get experiences money can't buy. They get points that are currency. They can shop on Amazon and Lyft and buy tickets at Live Nation. And there is no reason, as we continue coming out of this, to actively engage with our customer base, where it shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be able to push it meaningfully higher than where we kept -- where we maxed out before. 
 Now that will take time. And so to my Honors team, don't freak out. We're going to give you the time. But our goals there, which I'm not going to state publicly, are meaningfully higher than where we were, which, by the way, is meaningfully higher than any of our competitors already. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks. 
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. I know it's a busy earnings season. We're obviously quite pleased given what we've all lived through over the last 20 months to be able to report the progress that we were able to report for the third quarter. As you could tell from the call, I remain quite optimistic about where this recovery is going and what the opportunities are in the industry but particularly for our business and the growth of our business. And we'll look forward to reporting fourth quarter and full year after the New Year. Look forward to seeing many of you while we're out on the road. And have a terrific day and holiday, if I don't see you. 
Operator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-07-29 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update, or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financials on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call, in our earnings press release, and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President of Global Development will then review our second quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders. For our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment, for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities, for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models, for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most, and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits free cash flow and overall total returns. We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter, and down only 29 points versus 2019.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session.  And the first question will come from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. You gave some great color on NUG, but I'd like to peel back the onion a bit more. Specifically, can you discuss how net unit growth expectations have evolved over the quarter as we look around the world? Where your increased confidence comes from across things like brands, ads, leases, conversions? And how the financing environment is changing, as we consider not only this year but sustained growth beyond? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think, so goes the recovery, sort of, so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is, largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is, obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But, obviously, our expectation there is, as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So, I think it's pretty much that simple slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings people are back at it and picking up steam. On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. As you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so, while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. In terms of the financing environment, I mean there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is, it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the US and China, I would say the financing markets are recovering most rapidly, because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low, and lenders need yield. And so, the more comfort they get that recovery is afoot, and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. And so, you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The US is still -- has a ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall, and into next year you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available certainly here in the US. I think Europe will take a little longer. So, a ways to go. I'm not saying, it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year.
Stephen Grambling: Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, could you talk a little bit about how you guys plan to use key money in development spend? And obviously, in light of the financing environment that you just talked about and the way that's coming around, is it something you guys maybe rely on a little bit more in the near term and then start to wean away from it as we get more comfortable with kind of the outlook for new unit growth and things of that nature.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, that's a good question. If you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially meaning still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So, there's not any material shift given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now, is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So, example some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio, largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So, the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years I think, between host and here. And that's in the system an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip, we're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money, by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures is significant. And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the three deals 1,500 rooms in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case and PV was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together and in a matter of six or 12 months we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. And so that's I know a long answer but I view all of those and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now as I said aided by COVID. So, maybe there -- I would say our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020 but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at it versus our normal run rate like 2017, 2018, and 2019, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities even with key money they're very nice returns for us and they're incredibly I think strategic and important to the system.
Carlo Santarelli: Thanks Chris. That’s super helpful. I appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning Chris, good morning Kevin. Good morning Jill.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning Joe.
Kevin Jacobs: Good morning Joe.
Joe Greff: Given significant progress we've seen in the operating environment given your balance sheet and where your leverage ratios are heading by the end of this year I was hoping you could give us an update on how you're thinking about what you're looking at which might be obvious but and how you're looking at the timing of resuming capital return.
Chris Nassetta: Great. Great question. I figured I'd get it and I figured I'd get it early. So, thank you. I know that's on everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We ultimately that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So, I would say the update to that would be I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. But I think you should read the results of second quarter you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments plus everything you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not we read the papers I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the delta variant and things that are going on in the world but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes we -- every quarter that goes by I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind, next year and we do not need to hoard it our belief has always been that as I said in my prior answer we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So, my expectation is in the first half of next year that program will resume and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future.
Joe Greff: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: Good morning Chris. You mentioned a couple of times now just talking about that recovery in the fall. So, I was hoping we could dig in there a little bit. I know you're sort of probably right at the cusp of when you have too much color you can actually share on the corporate side. But can you talk about how that is starting to firm up be it September-October and what data you have? And then last quarter you talked a little bit about an exit trajectory for the year of possibly something in the down 30% range and I appreciate it may be a little early to give an update to that but kind of how are you thinking about that relative to maybe where we were three months ago?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, totally fair question. That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So, I'll give you I mean we do have some data points and some and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night as an example, system-wide US occupancy was 74%, Trailing seven days 74%. That's with the urban markets with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. So what that says to you like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean, while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally it's funny sort of post Memorial Day, I mean you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20% at any given night went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel dominated by small and medium-sized businesses by the way. But even pre-COVID keep in mind 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory my own view and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding again the delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. I do think in August you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right just because people are going to be like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. But when you get to the fall and limited -- we have limited data obviously this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not terrible. If you look at what's happened in the UK and we're sort of three or four weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes but they're going back to school and I'm pretty confident in that. And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people you're reading you're going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work which means with kids in school, with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers anecdotally, it supports all of that that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand okay, if things they've been needing to do and then there's just demand, generally to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure as we always do because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. I do believe again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year of 2019 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty we want to wait. We do do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not Camp Runamuck here. We are looking at our numbers. And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the US and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean again, much -- I said last time recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery but it's even better than I would have thought. I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's – again that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this – when we look back on this recovery the most unusual thing relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you for all the detail.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to follow up on that. I wanted to follow up a little bit on that. I think in your opening remarks you said that your group bookings are trending greater now in 2022 than they were in 2019, which I think is a pretty big positive increase sequentially from what you've mentioned on your first quarter call. And I was just hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about the composition of those groups and what you're seeing on the rate side. And maybe just kind of a little more color around folks' willingness to book group at this point.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Still – great question still building. What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that are greater than 2019. So to be specific rate. I didn't say volume. Volume is still a bit off just because it takes time to build the book. So my expectation is we get closer to next year and in the next year. In the year for the – later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta, the Delta wave and then in the year for the year we'll be a barn burner year bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again they're a bit – they're not where we were at 2019. They're close but they're not there but the rate is above. And so what I've been – honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful like we – there's going to be a monumental amount of demand we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation very strongly is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that in my opinion is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand and we can be a bit patient I think given what's going on.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Thanks. So on net unit growth, you've obviously seen some great progression in terms of your guide and you gave some helpful color earlier. But do you think you can get back to the 6% to 7% unit growth you were putting up pre-COVID? And if so when? 
Chris Nassetta: Yes I do. And I think it's probably sometime between 2023 and 2024 Kevin?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes.
Chris Nassetta: Kevin is also Head of Development. So I want to make sure he's – before I commit to him. Yes, I think it's sometime in 2023, 2024. Probably more 2024 just because you got to get through the – if you look at starts last year, you'd look at – I mean if you look at the progression you'll see when we're done last year we were down in starts. This year we'll be down modestly, not nearly as much as last year in starts. And I think that's the bottom. And then I think next year we'll be ramping up in starts. And I think if you just play that through that's what gets us in the mid-single digits for the next sort of couple of years two or three and then I think you're back in business in the 6% to 7% range.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. if the average construction time or gestation period in the pipeline is 2.5 or three years, you've got to be 2.5 or three years past the bottom, before you get back to your old run rate. 
Thomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question is from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Yes, I wanted to ask you about the pipeline as well. You mentioned that conversions were I think you said 30% of signings. I'm wondering what percent of openings that was in Q2 and maybe what you expect it to be for the full year? And then just on the theme of pipeline, you mentioned mid-single digits for the next two or three years. I think last quarter you had said that 2022 might be kind of in the 4% to 5% range but maybe lower than this year just given that there was some kind of construction catch up this year. So I'm wondering with the higher unit growth rate here in 2021. Does that carry through to sort of continued acceleration into 2022, or in fact is it bringing forward some things you thought would open in 2022 that kind of bring forward into 2021 and so maybe we'd still see that slightly lower rate closer to 4% next year than the 5% for 2022? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Robin, thanks. All good questions I think I've got it. I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say last year we were sort of 19% 20% of openings. I think this year it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. And look we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. The idea of -- I'll do the third one next the idea of 2022 being affected not as much. I mean I think 2022 is going to be about what we expect maybe a little bit of timing pull forward replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought.  And then yes, you picked up on we said 4% to 5% for the next several years we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits which of course 4% to 5% is mid-single digits. So it's about the same but I think what you're hearing is a little bit more optimism about the future of net unit growth given what's been going on lately.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you very much.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: Next question is from Richard Clarke from Bernstein. Please go ahead. 
Richard Clarke : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask your sort of opinion your thoughts on labor shortages in the US. And there's been some commentary around drops in service levels. Obviously, it's across the whole industry. But how much truth is there in that, or is this working the other way you actually being able to realize some sort of bigger efficiencies by working with less on the hotel side level? 
Chris Nassetta: Yes thanks Rick. It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people because they're worried about their health as already `been -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce or where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance of the federal top-up but that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall. I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. In terms of, what -- its impact on margins given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand margins are in many cases unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before and you can't get the labor so you just have less cost. That obviously, is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. Having said that long-term we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things, where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it but I do -- as the old adage goes this too I think shall pass. 
Richard Clarke : Thanks very much.
Operator: And the next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead. 
Bill Crow: Thanks. Good morning, Jill. A clarification and a question. The clarification is I think you mentioned that RevPAR was down 29% in June relative to 2019 numbers. And did you say that it was going to be closer to 20% down in the fourth quarter as we pivot to business travel? That's the clarification. 
Chris Nassetta: Yes I did. 
Bill Crow: The question I guess goes to your discussion about rate being the biggest surprise. I'm just -- I'm wondering if we're already at a point where we can declare victory over rate integrity maybe for the first time in any recovery right, or do we have to wait until we get into business travel and really see what lies beneath this leisure surge?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. On the first one I answered it, well, maybe you didn't hear, because I was -- and I apologize talking over you. But yes on the first. That's what I said to clarify the first question. You know me Bill, I tend to be a little under promise over deliver is my theory in life, so I don't want to declare victory yet on rate. I meant what I said. I mean I've been doing this a long time and been through bunches of recessions at this point. And what I'm seeing is very atypical. So -- and I do believe that into the fall and next year we're going to continue to have robust demand and improvement. So I think the rate story as I said in my earlier comment, when we look back on it I think that's going to be the real difference in recovery here, but I don't know about declaring victory. George W. Bush did it on an aircraft carrier. It didn't work out for him.
Bill Crow: It didn't work out so well.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. But listen it's nice to see. It's nice to see, but it's -- again it's just a function of demand. It's then being smart in how do you price demand.
Bill Crow: All right. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Quick question here and this is just, sort of, looking for a ballpark answer. But with the labor issue out there, what percentage of your hotels right now are unable to sell full inventory due to staffing shortages?
Chris Nassetta: I can't -- I don't have a scientific answer for you. I would say atmospherically I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio. It definitely -- there are definitely some hotels that can't because I've talked to some owners but -- and I was with a bunch of owners out of Dallas this week and labor was probably the number one topic, because it's what everybody's talking about. But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere. I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. And by the way it's helping to a degree -- it's also helping with rate, because in some markets where they can't they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which by the way back to Bill Crow when we're done with it maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. So in the hotels where they are having issues in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to are having great success in moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. And net-net they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long-term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort, I mean, I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and ultimately deliver the service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But at the moment from an owner point of view in many cases, some are limiting capacity but I think it's a relatively small percentage.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you for the color. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions if I may. Within the franchise fees line item, we're in a moment where it's -- candidly nothing is easy to model I assume for either of us. But that one in particular was much larger than what we had and I know that there is a number of things in there. Getting to franchise fees should be straightforward. But Kevin if you could give us just a little insight on the other pieces that are in there right? There's credit card fees and there are some royalties in there, and how those flow a little modeling would be welcome?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. David, it's hard and easy all at the same time. I mean, basically overall fee growth was a bit lower than overall RevPAR growth that's your question. And the real -- the short answer is, yeah, license fees are growing. By the way they're growing really strongly. I think license fees were up something like 80% in the second quarter, but that's obviously a lot less than RevPAR growth at 234%. And so just the math ends up being a little bit less than RevPAR. And so when we -- when we're in this period of RevPAR growth being at these really elevated rates because of the crazy comps, we're going to be a little bit lower than fee growth. On a long-term basis it should be about one to one. So that's the easiest way I can lay it out.
David Katz: Got it.
Kevin Jacobs: Like, we said it's hard to model though. Sorry about that.
David Katz: That's okay. No whatever you got I will take. If I may ask a similar question around, sort of, owned and leased. It's not -- certainly not the biggest part within your model. But if you don't mind my asking any color on sort of how that recovers and grows out in the future would be helpful as well. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, it's totally fair question. I mean, it's sort of telegraphed a little bit in our prepared remarks again pretty straightforward. I mean that portfolio is concentrated in places like the UK, Central Europe and Japan in particular that are just behind in the trajectory of recovery. So all the things we talked about there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4. We'll see what happens. Again it's dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is obviously it's going to grow more quickly than the core business. So it's going to contribute positively to our growth going forward because it's going to be growing off of a much lower base. 
David Katz: Perfect. Appreciate the help. Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead. 
Vince Ciepiel: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to the Honors contribution which sounded really high. I think you said around 60%, which is maybe a few points under 2019. And that's all while business transient is still I think 30 points off. I think that usually over-indexes to brand direct. So just curious how you think this direct contribution evolves through the pandemic. Usually there's a narrative that OTAs take share, but it seems like your direct business is really impressive. How do you think it evolves over the course of the next year? 
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Well, I -- over the next year it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors such that as I've been saying for a long time you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology. You get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us you're sort of silly, I mean just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to over the years as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of, go high and low make sure that for our most frequent travelers it's a really relevant program which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us and I think it's helped us sort of over the last five years lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels two or three days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because, it's a currency effectively and there's a value proposition that works for them. And so being specific about it we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out in May we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in 2019. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well I think it's two things. One in May and June our core travelers started to come back. Number two we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, gosh, I would like to be an Honors member and sign up and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back obviously we believe we've got a great value proposition and they're staying. And when you put one and one together you hope to get three. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition the happier they are. The better experience with the technology the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. So for all the right reasons we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in two or three years while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry including us I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts. 
Vince Ciepiel: Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks. 
Chris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time today. Obviously, we covered a lot of territory and you can probably tell from my comments we're obviously pleased with Q2 relative to where the business has been industry-wide and the company. And we're very bullish about while we know there are risks out there not oblivious to that we think those are all reasonably manageable and we're very bullish about not just the second half of the year, but very bullish about recovery as we go into 2022 and beyond. We look forward -- appreciate time and we'll look forward to catching everybody up after we finish our third quarter. Take care. Have a great day. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-05-05 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode.  After today's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. You may begin.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's first quarter 2021 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factor section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our first quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. It has been a little over a year since the pandemic started. Over that time, we acted swiftly to address the challenges we face so we could quickly turn our focus to best positioning ourselves towards recovery and beyond. I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific weighed on demand through January and most of February, March marked a turning point as we lapped the start of the U.S. lockdowns RevPAR turned positive of more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month, driven by strong leisure demand. As expected recovery in group and corporate transit continued to lag but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management franchise fees decreased 34% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected license fees and development fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment, reinstated lock downs and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. For the quarter diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02.
Operator: Thank you. We will now move to our question-and-answer session.  And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: So Chris, Kevin, you guys gave some helpful data points around kind of the acceleration that you saw throughout the first quarter. And speaking more maybe on the U.S. front, could guys maybe talk a little bit about, March and maybe to the extent you're willing to April and how kind of not only RevPAR trends, I know, you gave some data points on occupancy, with the 55% exit rate coming out of March, kind of what you've seen from a fee generation on the U.S. side as it pertains to the occupancy gains. And then, perhaps how you're thinking about beyond people coming back into the office, the aspect of pent up demand within the business and corporate traveler as we get maybe it's probably a fourth few event, I think most of us would assume at this point. But how do you guys think about that?
Chris Nassetta: Boy, that's a lot of questions all embedded into one. But that is probably the most important; I'll cover parts of it. Maybe Kevin will throw some things in. And we'll save a little bit maybe for later, because I'm sure there is a lot of similar questions, but thank you. And I do think that is the question, obviously as both Kevin and I covered Carlo, we saw, pretty marked improvement, as we march through the quarter. And that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against, a 19 comparison, because looking at it against, 2020, particularly right now, as you were in the early stages of the pandemic is relatively useless. And so, if you look at January and February, you were globally and the U.S. was similar, if you look at it, you were sort of in the 55% to 60%, down from a RevPAR power point of view. And you picked up about 10 points, going down into the -- sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then, in April, you had another step up and into the low 40s. Obviously, made a little early to say but I would say that trajectory in our mind continues if we look at forward bookings both. On the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter, it feels like we're going to continue marching on. If you look at it by segments, which I you know, obviously, it's been a lot of time and this will sort of get to some of our views on the business transient and the group side. If you look at it, you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019. Again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of it. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of 19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter, again, lower if you look at it, on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35 to 40. As you march through, our expectations for the year, our belief is globally and every region will be a little bit different. And I'll save a regional question for somebody else, because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on one question. But if you march through, the year, my expectation is, you're going to have an incredibly robust, leisure driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand as we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things I'm reading, but I'm also as I'm sure you are talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think, clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office, certainly, as you get into the fall, all things, sort of being equal in terms of trajectory, vaccination, most businesses are going to be bringing folks back maybe not fully, probably not fully, but on some flexible basis. But a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. We do believe that and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States, where restrictions have been lifted earlier, I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volumes already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work as kids in the fall, go back-to-school, which at this point, I think is very highly likely you are going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transients. I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change in the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more Smurf kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings, really some happening but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that that we will have a lot of realized group business a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year. So if you sort of jumped to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure, Q3 is going to sort of be a transition on a room night basis. Our forecasting, which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data. And then based on sort of the current trajectory that we're on, we think room nights and leisure will be at 19 levels. We don't think rates will be back to 19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure sort of in the low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient and by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis will be about 70%-ish. I'm being reasonably precise, obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimate. And obviously, lower than that on a RevPAR basis, because we're still not going to have the all the highest rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to 19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view could be halfway back to 19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest rated groups, those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association, etc, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. We think that, as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus 19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something-ish of 19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home, but is a heck of a lot, better than where we were and what I would say not to be pollyannaish about it, what I would say is, the recovery of late, certainly since we had our last call the recovery, the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought in all regards. Now, a lot of it has to come on the business trends, that we're seeing some as I described, not like we have none. And we're seeing a pretty decent up tick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it, we think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked. And thus, our reason for optimism, the things are on a good path. You asked about fee generation that will follow and I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that, as the business recovers, so go our fees, that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave us sort of my view and our view of pent up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to whether they run a business, whether you talk to him, they're a friend of yours, you see him on the beach, or wherever you are, that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure but increasingly needing to and wanting to get out for business and to congregate in groups. There are a lot of important work to get done in these group settings that I think after a while people realize that that is not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope, we need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at, every minute of every day, because that's all the media is covering, obviously, we need all that to progress. But our view is, we're on a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you wanted? I let a few nuggets for somebody else to ask about.
Carlo Santarelli: Yes. I don’t drive corporate tunnel for writing. So I appreciate the response. Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.
Joe Greff: I think most of my demands related, recovery related questions were sufficiently answered before. So I just like to talk about the development pipeline, nice to see that up sequentially, on a quarter-over-quarter basis. What we've been seeing for a while now is that the non-U.S. component is becoming a bigger percentage of the pipeline. How much of the non-U.S. is limited service? And how did that composition -- how did that compared to maybe a year ago? And maybe where I'm going with this question is when you look at the average fee per room, in your development pipeline now versus a year ago? Is that average fee per room up or down?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, that's a good question. I think those trends are not changing dramatically in the short term, right? They sort of stay, we've got a pretty good development pipeline, both in full service and limited service, you have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our master limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2. But also, as we deploy Hilton Garden Inn and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady, as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking in both the pipeline of rooms under construction, I think it's about 60:40, full service limited service. And that stayed pretty constant. All the other way, sorry, 40:60.
Operator: Next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.
Shaun Kelley: Chris, or Kevin, maybe to stick with the same development topic. Inflation has become a big theme around all the markets recently. And I just want to get your thoughts on specifically what this could mean for the hotel development side? Are you seeing or hearing about any changes or delays that could be out there as a result of things like materials inflation? Is this particular concern to you at all and how you're underwriting or what you're starting to hear back from your development teams?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean, we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input costs, but labor as well. So when they ultimately -- when people need to operate, open and operate, the costs are higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring costs down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But costs to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available for the best owners it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. But, I suspect and sort of built in, Shawn, to our expectations on the unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower, that's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place and the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those, those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, etc, etc. And so, not unlike coming out of the Great Recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like, after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S., there wasn't so much an inflationary so there was just a dearth of capital and new construction starts went way down, that's what's happening here, that'll be healthy for the industry and what did we do, we pivoted then the same way. We're pivoting now, just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world, in the areas of the world that are continuing, to not only motor along, but pick up steam. I mean, I think China is an example, in our second biggest market, we're going to sign more, start more and open more deals, than I think we ever have this year, right. And so, diversification is a powerful thing. Ultimately, I do believe the pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time and I don't think it'll be that long a period of time, I'm highly confident that the financing markets will -- have been easing up and will continue to ease up and the U.S. in terms of new development, or new construction starts will be a huge engine of opportunity for us, as it always has been and pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But, we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much. But I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth. While lots of crazy things are going on around the world, because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow. And so, while we do starting -- finishing with where I started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be.
Operator: Next question will be from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: On capital allocation, what are the key factors you are considering and bringing back the dividend and/or buyback and thinking through just capital allocation priorities more broadly?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think, look, the second part maybe is a little more straightforward. Our overall view on capital allocation hasn't changed. Obviously, we've suspended dividend and buyback to preserve liquidity during the pandemic, but the way we think about it broadly hasn't changed. And I think the way we think about it, more specifically on the first part of your question is, we want to get a little further into the recovery, a little bit further into reliably generating free cash -- positive free cash flow and having our leverage levels start to come down. And so that, unless something crazy happens, we think that happens over the course of the year, we'll talk to our board about it sort of in the second half of the year as the recovery takes shape. And we'd say it's highly likely that starting next year, we get back into the capital return business.
Operator: And the next question is from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: Hearing your earlier comments, the slope of recoveries are better than expected, Chris, what's your latest thinking on when RevPAR gets back to 2019 levels?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. That's a great question. Actually, Thomas, thanks for asking. It is one that we were debating over the last few days ourselves. And there are varying opinions on it even in inside our own shop. I mean, I've been saying 23 or 24, as you know, on these calls publicly and I still believe that I think with the slope of the recovery I'd probably be on the earlier end of that, rather than the later, as we have a little bit more visibility. I think there is a chance from a room night point of view, certainly on a run rate basis that we get back next year. But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires certainly in the U.S. that broadly requires the bigger groups to be back. And while I think they're coming back and certainly they want to be back, the planning and all of that, say it's on a lag. So I think that takes some time next year. So I still say 23, 24, but I'd probably hear towards the earlier end of that.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi.
Smedes Rose: I kind of along the same lines, you see the acceleration, in RevPAR, in your conversations, really on the corporate side, for groups less on the association side? Do you sense any hesitancy on the part of corporates to move back in terms of having enjoyed a year of essentially no travel budgets, any kind of pushback that you think in terms of the amount of people they put on the road? Or the amount of people they put into groups? Or is that not really an issue and it just put a pegging off this idea of impairment?
Chris Nassetta: It's another reason I think it takes time to get back to 19 levels, sort of picking up my earlier answer is because I do think, not only people cut budgets, not everybody, was Amazon or whatever and that has really benefited during this time a lot. Most businesses by number have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn and recovery, when this happens that those budgets will build back, but it will take some time. Now, I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway, because nobody's going to doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the year. So I think, ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity, I look at our own budget, there's plenty of budget capacity, when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, if we're in a full scale recovery, while people are going to, for a period of time, want to be thrifty. I think in the end, it'll just be what the opportunity set is. And if we're in a robust recovery, what I have seen again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that, the rope gets, businesses let the rope through their hands, because they have to, they have to deliver alpha, they have to compete against other businesses that are trying to do the same thing. And so, their people have to get out on the road, they have to have meetings, they have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out, get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So, the steeper the slope of the recovery, like in every other cyclical recovery and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the health, then you're in a cyclical economic recovery, the steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. But that's why I said 23, 24. I, again, I said probably I'd take the earlier of that the rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer, we will get back to room nights, I think faster, because we'll still find room nights that are lower rated business, because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normalize, sort of between now and 2023, if the slope of the recovery is what we think, is what we're seeing.
Operator: Next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.
David Katz: Covered a lot of territory already. But I wanted to just talk about the development in general. And, we have not talked much about the degree to which the interactions with owners, maybe changed either temporarily or permanently. We've been so focused on the demand recovery, which obviously is worthy of consuming our attention. But is there any semi-permanent or permanent change and the manner in which you deal with the development community and sort of how those monies and risks are managed long-term.
Chris Nassetta: It's a complicated answer, I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe, obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation, I would say that 99.9% now, some of them are much further along in recovery, because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery resort market, southern U.S., and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community, obviously, has been hurting, as have we, as have the whole industry, there's not -- it's not like, it's been easy on any of us. We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community and those are still fully deployed, in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas and we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts. And I do believe as we get to a real recovery there's opportunities to get help with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work, day and night, on those efforts as things evolve. And obviously, we've done, a whole bunch of work in the short-term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board, so that owners could -- make manage their way, we could all manage our way to the other side, I've mentioned it in passing. But it's worth mentioning, again, we call it our hotel, the future work, we were looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work but we were done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which is the highest levels in our history at this moment. But also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S. particularly, that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe which I do, that, when you get out a couple years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19 even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. So our owners, while it's difficult, now when we get the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing a new development, we think are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic, because we think we were just doing a better -- we're going to do we are and will continue to do a better job. And so that's a long winded way of getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think they'll be a meaningful difference. I mean, with some owners, there may be but I would say, in the main I don't think so, I think the owner community, that we deal with which is an immensely diversified community, we have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with, the vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis. And it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. And I don't think if we can deliver for them, the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more of the bottom-line, that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're don’t want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, this being pragmatic, because this has been really difficult, and which is why we've worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges both and what we could do, what the government could do to get them the other side. And why I said in, honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S. where why I think the new development side and all of these pressures and just the pressures of owners, broadly is going to mean, it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of development to pick up what it was pre-pandemic, but that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what it was. And as I said before, in the meantime, it's a big world and we've pivoted and we're doing some really cool things around the world to make sure that we continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein.
Richard Clarke: Just a quick question on the owned and leased portfolio, obviously, that seems to have driven the most volatility in the quarter. Where do your ambitions with that particular division stand? Are you looking to transition that more rapidly towards asset light now? And where do you think the cost savings in that segment can land in the longer term?
Kevin Jacob: Well, the cost savings, look, it's everything across the board, just like any hotel owner would be doing in times like this, we're looking for cost savings in sort of literally every aspect of the operations. I think our ambitions in that portfolio, we are pretty capital aid, right? So even in normal times, that ownership was down to 7% to 8% of our overall EBITDA, something like that in 2019. And we've been saying for a long time that if we think about -- we think about our portfolio, it's about 60 hotels, primarily leases, about 20 of them were strategic, we'll be in those leases, no matter what, over time, they have good coverage, they're important hotels, we've got 20 at the bottom, where they're sort of legacy -- their legacy deals that we inherited fixed lease payments in markets that aren't as robust, those we will exit no matter what, when the leases are up. And then, there's about 20, that are in the middle, where when the leases roll, we sit down with the landlord, and if we can work out an arrangement that we think makes sense for us to continue, we continue, if we don't, we get out. And we've sort of enrolling our way out of three to four of them a year, we think it's actually probably more like six to eight of them this year, that will transition out of either transitioning them to management agreements, or franchise agreements, or just getting out. And over time, you'll wake up a few years from now and it'll be something like less than 5% of our overall EBITDA and that will remain the trajectory.
Chris Nassetta: Having said that, in the next -- starting in the second half of the year and into the next couple of years, this will accelerate our overall growth, just because, sadly, the ownership segment given a lot of the fixed rent nature of it and where it's been, which has been concentrated in U.K., Europe and Japan, which have been impacted, dramatically, more impacted. If you look at the RevPAR numbers in those markets and in the segment are twice as bad in the first quarter as the overall. As you get those markets open, you're going to take those numbers, which have been terrible, will become a significant contributor to growth.
Kevin Jacob: Yes. And we think that happens over the course of the second half of the year.
Operator: And the next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS.
Robin Farley: Great. Yes, I had a question going back to the unit growth topic. One is, I wonder if you have thoughts about 22 unit growth. The rate, you mentioned U.S. new construction, obviously, would be lower, kind of how that would compare to this year's 4.5% to 5%. And then, also on that topic, the conversions in this quarter, I think we're 20 some percent of openings. Do you see that moving higher? In other words, are you in the early stages of budget conversions that maybe will come out later this year? I know you've talked in the past about how pressures in the business can lead to a greater rate of conversion. So wondering if that's teeing up for later this year? And then, could that offset the lower new construction growth next year? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, sure, Robin, good questions. I think, look, in the first part, I think we've said, several times publicly that we think over the next several years, it'll be between 4% and 5%. And, sort of the range there is meant to capture sort of all of the things we've been talking about, right, the timing of openings, the timing of conversions, the timing of removals, the trajectory that we're seeing in new construction. So we still think 4% to 5%, it'll be within that range for the next few years. And then, the second half on conversions, yes, we do you think conversions will pick up over time. In the last cycle, it got to something in the 40% range of overall deliveries probably doesn't get and we've think we've said this publicly as well, probably doesn't get back to that level. This cycle just because the denominator likely won't contract that dramatically, but we do think conversions will continue to be bigger contributor, it'll be a little bit lumpy a lot of them are larger hotels, some of the things we're working on now or bigger deals either portfolio deals or larger individual hotels that sort of require a transaction to happen for the conversion to happen. So I don't know if that happens later this year or next year, but it definitely will pick up over time.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow from Raymond James.
Bill Crow: Looking globally, how important is outbound Chinese travel to the recovery in Europe? And are there any comments you can make on the trends about on Chinese travel to that?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, we've been having a lot of discussion within the industry. And within China, in fact, I participated in a meeting with the Premier Li of China, just a couple of weeks ago and this is one of the topics that we talked about. If you look at our business, using some metrics, in our business, like in the U.S., international, inbound, only about 4% of the business, if you look at our business globally, it's about 10%. And it does weigh, obviously, more heavily inbound business in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, which depends on it more. So would be higher than 10%, a large feeder market is China, I mean, its other parts of the world as well, but it's China. And so I think as Europe opens up, obviously, they're going to be like the rest of the world, I think they're going to be doing, within region travel, which given all the pent up demand, as actually I think been reasonably good, just like we're seeing in the U.S., even though we don't have much inbound travel going on, we don't have any outbound going on. And so I think, in the end Europe's opportunity for the early stages of recovery are robust for the same reason, while they're not going to have inbound from China, or other markets, they're not going to have any outbound and Europeans like to travel and particularly in the summer, like to go on vacations and when it's open and they can, they will and they'll stay within the confines of either their countries or the region. So I think I think it's going to be fine. Obviously, longer term, as you get some more stabilized world, you want to open up these travel quarters, I had a meeting with the White House last week, maybe the week before they said with Premier Li of China, the week before that. And we were talking about a lot of topics, but that was a primary topic both was the Chinese administration and the U.S. administration on trying to figure out how do we figure out as the world is getting vaccinated and it's a little uneven, but as certain countries are getting heavily vaccinated and getting to a reasonable level of herd immunity. How do we open up safe travel corridors? Europe is doing the same thing. Those discussions are ongoing we're trying to get those discussions going with the U.S. They are obviously, already starting to have those discussions with China. And so, I don't you know -- that will take some time, I think you will start to see some bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements in the second half of this year. I think we're at a stage right now, where we're --- everybody's still focused on vaccination to get their herd immunity. But with the overwhelming amount of supply of vaccines, which aren't all distributed perfectly around the world, or even around our country at this point, but the numbers are becoming overwhelming, the surplus is there going to be calm as we get into this summer, my sense is overwhelming. And we're going to be able to have a shifting of those resources around the world to the markets most in need, as we get into June, July, August, September and into the latter part of the year, that is going to allow for a reasonably, hopefully a reasonable trajectory in terms of, some of the some of these economies getting to a better place. China is obviously already in a reasonably good place. So, as the U.S. sort of, has a few more months in Europe, I think the real opportunities to start opening travel quarters. I do think it'll happen that way, just based on the discussions I'm having with multiple administrations than our teams are having, I don't think it's going to be like, one day the world's open, you know, like, Yay, everybody. I think it's going to be agreements between like, the U.S. in the U.K., the EU and China, the U.S. and China that will allow for those quarters to open up, you know, make sure that there's flight capacity that the regime for vaccination testing and all that is sort of is bolted down. So that's a long answer, because it needs to be as complicated, I think in the second half of the year. My hope is and belief is that you're going to start to see some of those corridors open up. We're pushing everybody really hard. But in the meantime, I think we're fine. Just because if a corridor is not open, as I said, people are restrained and leaving their country or their territory, and they're going to start traveling when they feel safe. And you're going to keep all that pent up demand in your local market.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist.
Patrick Scholes: One of the issues of the moment at the property level is with staffing and wages. I'm wondering your thoughts on this? Do you see that as a temporary issue that hotels can get by the summer without having to raise wages to attract employees? Or do you see wage inflation inevitable to meet the staffing challenges? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, it's a difficult issue, as I'm sure if you're talking to the ownership community you're hearing and listen, we talk to him every day and we operate a lot of properties. It is singularly at the moment, I wouldn't say the only issue when you're in a global pandemic, there's lots of issues, but it's one of the most important issues because, it is very difficult, particularly here in the U.S. to get labor and it is constraining recovery on a certain times, because you can't get enough people to service the properties. I do think in the short-term, I've already said it, and it's implied in earlier questions, there's going to be wage pressure, wage inflation, I do think it will stabilize and work itself out as we get later into the year, it's a complex issue, That is at the intersection of people being concerned about their health still, particularly in some of the communities that we need to get focused, back in coming back to work and that's going to take some time, both vaccination and marketing to a number of those communities to get vaccinated and getting it done and getting them to a place where they feel safe being in a workplace. So that's part of it. And then, the other part of it is, getting kids back in school, because a lot of people in the workforce are taking care of kids, they don't there's no daycare, school becomes daycare, and the federal government's it for all the right reasons, the way back when did a top up of unemployment insurance and on top of the state unemployment insurance and obviously sent out $14 100 checks and they did all these things to support people that were in arm's way, all of all of which made sense. At the time, maybe some of it makes a little bit less sense now, in the sense that the demand is there, and the jobs are there. Yet people don't have as much of a need to come back to it. So, but that in theory, on September, whatever, six, the Federal top up, expires, I guess it could be extended my impression, it will not be -- my hope is it will not be not because I don't care about the people, I think there's just enough jobs. We literally, I think 3 million of our Hilton but industry folks do a lot of work. I think by the time you get to September, October, I think the vast majority of those could easily be reemployed given what I think demand will be in the business. And that's for everybody, right best for the country. It's best for the individual, team members, but it's that the convergence of all of that. So I think it's going to tough. I haven't been talking to a ton tomorrow, I think it'll be tough between now and September. I think when we, by the time you get to September, mass vaccination will hopefully be behind us, kids will be back in school. And people will feel safe, that it's safe to go back. And they want to get back in be earning a paycheck. And so, I think it will then stabilize as we get into the latter part of the year.
Patrick Scholes: Thank you, Chris for your complex and evolving…
Chris Nassetta: Trust me, we're spending a lot, there's no silver bullet in the short-term. We've spent a lot of time on it. I think this is one of those, you just have to sort of -- you just have to work through it. It will work out because all of those things are going to be changing. And so the conditions are going to change pretty materially, as we get to the fall, but between here and there, it's going to be incremental, because then I think it'll be a sea change in the fall.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Chris Nassetta for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Chad, thank you and to everybody that joined us today, we appreciate the time, as always, it's hard to say we're really pleased with where things are given what we've been through over this last year and that we're still in the middle or towards hopefully the end of a pandemic. But we are pleased, I've always had confidence in the business model of ours. I've always had confidence in people's desire to travel; for all the reasons they have always wanted to travel. I think the evidence is pretty clear one that -- the decisions that we made as a result of the crisis have made our business stronger. We're driving higher market shares, higher margins, on a lower cost structure and that as we see, the telltale signs of getting past the health crisis. We're starting to see the world come back to life and all the reasons I thought people wanted to travel are, I think playing out, the way in and we had hope for we have a ways to go. So I don't want to be a power Pollyanna about it, but we feel good about where we are and definitely incrementally better than we did over the last couple quarters. So thanks again. And we'll look forward to reporting back after we finish our second quarter.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2021-02-17 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factor section of our most recently filed Form 10-K as supplemented by our 10-Q filed on November 4, 2020. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our fourth quarter and full-year results. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you all joining us today and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with something difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne’s passing. To say I’m deeply saddened by that loss. It would be an understatement. I as many of had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at host. I think it’s very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better, because of him and I am a better professional and a better person, because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton family and the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts. As we all know this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experience demand declines we’ve never seen before in our 101-year history. Guided by our founding purpose to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality we acted quickly to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. As a result of these news, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger higher margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. While it’s certainly been a very difficult year, we’re proud of everything we’ve accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. For that, I’d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them, our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. Because of our amazing people, we’ve been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the number one best place to work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the number three world’s best workplace to help get us through these trying times. Turning to results for the full year system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrate the strength of our brands and power of our customer centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region even in a distressed business environment. For the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 59% relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum and demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted. As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlocked pent-up travel demand for the first quarter overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S. offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meet meaningful rebounds, and corporate transient and group business. Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened a tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progress. On the group side, we saw meaningful step up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year. Despite the challenges in 2020, we up in more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1% slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focus service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. We also celebrated our 1 million through milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline up 3% year-over-year. While our market disruption wait on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year. As owners looked a benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our Collection brands. During the quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles, the property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spacious guestrooms and suites and five world-class food and beverage venues. Schedule to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio. Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the opening of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR is U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years. The pandemic rapidly change guest behaviors, priorities and concerns, we listened to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors Loyalty Program, deliver industry leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible distraction-free environments for remote work with workspaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions and expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebound. Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy. Throughout 2020, we also remain focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We’re proud to contribute to our communities and we’re honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. In a year marked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully manage key stakeholder relationships and continue to press forward on strategic opportunities. I’m confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient and we are better positioned than ever before. With that, I’m going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I’d like to echo Chris’s sentiments about Arne, my thoughts are certainly with his family and with my many friends at Marriott, who I know are hurting this morning. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions. Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50% less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better than expected honors license fees and development fees. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our lease properties. Continued cost control measures coupled with one-time items, mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we’ve lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a wealth staggered maturity later thereafter. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning guys.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff: Nice to hear your voices. Chris, I just want to start off with a big picture question, I’m sure you’ll get a lot of questions about 2021 net rooms growth and how you’re thinking about pipeline growth from here. But Chris, love to hear your thoughts on how you’re thinking about your business three years out post vaccine. What’s different about your business in terms of individual business transient travel, group travel, leisure travel relative to pre-COVID? What’s different do you think about full service and limited service development in the future relative to pre-COVID?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, it’s a great question. And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out and obviously you could debate this and I’ve debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out three years, whatever, three or four years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in 2017, 2018 and 2019. And meaning the makeup of the business as between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think will look quite similar. Now, certain of the types of – if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient and the group side might be for different reasons, then I mean, there’ll be a substitution effect clearly in certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new – the Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But there’ll be replaced with other forms of travel. We’ve seen this throughout history, I mean, if you go back and it wasn’t really around, but the telephone and the internet and telepresence and voicemail, there were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate. And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right. Because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds – it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate, they need to travel, they need to build relationships, they need to build cultures, they need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting, as well as individual business travel type needs. And so I – having done it longer than I’d like to admit, 35, 40 years, we’ve been debating this. I don’t – again, I think there’ll be some substitution effect, but I think it’ll look a lot like it did. And then our business a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing higher margin business. Why because, listen, throughout the next three years, we’re going to continue to grow 4% to 5% unit growth. So we’re going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you’ll have similar demand levels. We’ll be producing, like they were. You’ll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure. Because we’ve taken a significant amount of cost out on a cash basis, sort of, if you look at on a run rate in this year sort of on a cash basis in the mid-teen, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we’re going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we’ve been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that’s going to, when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it’s simple math, it’s a higher margin business. And so I know, it’s sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism. And so I probably shouldn’t, but as we sit around this table, I’m at our board table and we talk about it. It’s been hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured, but as a result of it, we put ourselves and about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it’s going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which we’re going to be – which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre-COVID to our shareholders, which you think over the very long-term is going to drive incredible returns. The last point was on limited service, full service, and I’m not – I’m covering a lot of territory, but you ask these things. And I think it’s an important note, because it’s something I talked a lot about pre-COVID that, frankly, I don’t think got enough attention, which is the megatrend in our – in the industry, in every market in the world. There is not an exception is the mid-market, right. Why is that? Because, that’s where the bulk of the population is, that’s where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford mid-market brands? I would say, I know I’m sort of patting us that. We have the best mid-market brands in the world. I mean, it’s being proven out in the growth of those brands, both in the U.S. but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China. And that’s not by luck, we’ve been very purposeful over the last 10 years and making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view, we picked great development partners, like, we’ve done in China to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want, what the development community in those environments – in those regions want. That has allowed us to show really strong and growth and continue to. So the megatrend, which was before COVID, and I would say, as a result of the economic distress that this has caused only gets sort of accentuated in a post-COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we’ve done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it’s showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right. Because the bulk of that unit, I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury, we’re making tremendous progress there, lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that. But the bulk of – you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I’ve been saying it for years, if you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth and demand. And thus the bulk of the growth in rooms, it’s going to be in the mid-market. And that’s why we’ve been focused on everything, but so intensely focused in that, because in the end, that’s what’s going to drive a higher growth rate. That is what having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what’s going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha over the next 10 or 20 years.
Joe Greff: Great. That’s helpful. Appreciate it, Chris. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions.
Chris Nassetta: Hey, Carlo.
Carlo Santarelli: [Indiscernible]
Chris Nassetta: Carlo, we can’t hear you very well. Could you speak up a little, sorry?
Carlo Santarelli: I’m sorry, guys. Do you hear me a little better?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, yes, yes. Sorry.
Carlo Santarelli: So I appreciate you taking my question. You’ve spent some time on talking about how you’re thinking about pipeline and I guess kind the conversion look, maybe about 19% of [indiscernible] How do you see conversion activity representing today the growth algorithm over the next call it 12 months to 24 months? Obviously, they will be used to augment or could you kind of see that extroversion percentage [indiscernible] kind of peeking out the next two years.
Chris Nassetta: I think I got all that, you are kind of cutting in and out. So I’ll answer what I think I heard. And if I missed something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1%, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we’ve said over the next few years, we think we’ll deliver 4% to 5% and I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it’ll probably be more the mid-point to the high end of that, again – similar to last year, but I think over the next years we feel comfortable with that. And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question is a success that we’re having on the conversion side. We’ve always been focused on conversions and in downturns, as everybody knows, that’s very fertile ground. Over the past five or six years, we’ve gone from having essentially one conversion brand, really that was the big engine, which was DoubleTree to now having four, between our three soft brands and DoubleTree, all of which are producing for us. And I think we’ll continue to escalate. I mentioned it my prepared comments, our signings for conversions were up 30% last year, our starts which I did not mention, probably should have were up 40%, and our fourth quarter, our opens were up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like, it takes a little bit of time to ramp, you’re right. We were circa 20% of overall NUG in conversions. That was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you’ll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG. How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question. So I’ll answer it unclear. I mean, we – in the great recession, it went into the 40s. I don’t think it will go that high, because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth, as compared to the great recession. I don’t think it’ll go that higher, but I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years. And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it, as you would guess. And the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely. Did I miss anything in your question?
Carlo Santarelli: No. Thanks very much.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Carlo.
Operator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning, everyone. And thanks for all the remarks. Chris or Kevin, maybe sort of going down the same path as you just did for net units on digging in on the G&A cadence a little bit – a little bit more. Obviously, I think there’s some noise with stock-based comp, but Chris, I think you referred to overall kind of cash expense savings in a higher margin profile restructure looking out a few years. Could you just help us kind of build on that a little bit as you kind of look out a little further? What’s either the right run rate to think about relative to 2019 levels for 2021? Or just maybe even more strategically, how much more efficient, do you think we are a few years out from now versus where we end to 2019.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Shaun, I’ll take that one. I think, you sort of pointed out some of it right on the GAAP G&A side, includes stock comp that’s non-cash, right. So over the course of last year, we wrote down our plans and then we put in a new plan in place in the fourth quarter. So you saw some things bounce around and then overall it ended up at 30%. On a cash basis, we ended up, I can’t remember, if Chris, you said this in your first answer, but on a cash basis, we ended up about 20% better 2020 over 2019. And then I know Chris did say this, we think 2021 versus 2019, we’ll be down in the mid-teens on a cash basis. And so how can that trend going forward? It didn’t look overall wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation over time, that’s probably not going to trend. But we’ve – look, we’re adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years, we’re going to remain disciplined as we always have and there’s no reason to think that we can’t grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation. There’s slightly more than inflation, because that’s probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there’s nothing that we see in the future that says we can’t continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, everyone. Good to hear everyone’s voices.
Chris Nassetta: You too, David.
David Katz: Thank you. Chris, in your comments, you talked about pent-up demand for corporate travel and you made some comments around group. And I’m hoping that you might be able to go just a little bit further and talk about how broad based that might be any industries, et cetera. It’s obviously quite intuitive that leisure would have a lot of pent-up demand, but we spend a lot of time debating those other segments and would just love a little more depth if you have it available.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I can give you – I’ll give you what I do have. I mean, I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side and I think we all – I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have and certainly the higher end leisure business says has not really been out and about. And so I think, as you get through, what is it going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days. I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I’m hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you’re now reading in the papers too, but we’re having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think the President said last night, I heard that, by the end of July, every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved probably by the end of this month that could be much – that could be sooner than the middle of the summer. So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they’ve been buying stuff like crazy, as we know, because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out more than ever talk to anybody – talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. So I think the trend line there will be quite good, when you get a bit of the all clear sign, which I think will be hopefully by spring, certainly no worse than summer. On that business transient, there are data points. I mean, but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we’re having with our big customers and trends that we’re seeing. And as we’re having discussions with our customers, as we’ve been renegotiating, all of our corporate negotiated counts. I mean, clearly, there is massive pent-up demand. I mean, they may – they’re obviously in businesses that are hurting, they’re going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of 2018 and 2019. But the reality is, they’re in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that, it’s just – it’s been over a year. By the time, they’re out a little bit 15 months and forget the fact they want to see people, they need to see people. And so you’re starting to see that, even though we’re in the – you see the infection rates coming down, I mean, we’re still not through the crisis for sure. And you starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean, the business transient trends are clearly sort of week by week are marching up, even in the middle of all this, even though we don’t have the all – an all clear sign. So not tons of data other than well, real booking data suggests, short-term, it’s moving the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that in lots of surveying that we’re doing, it’s suggesting, like, it was – the people are more interested in travel for leisure and business, as our pulling is like over 80% of them say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number. Obviously, we’ve seen since this mess began. So that’s good on the group side, that’s going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December was up 50%, I give you the quarter because normally January would step up from December because of the holidays. So I want to – I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that’s up by more than a third, a stat that I – as I go through with the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side, was that our first half position for 2021 versus 2019. So let’s forget 2020, because it was a washout. I mean, the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus the stabilize here of 2019, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of 2019 is down by 32%. So again, it’s still off, but by a lot lesser margin and that’s a result of people saying I got to get out, I want to get out. I got to have team meetings. I got to have small group, medium-sized group, conventions are starting to book again, because they’re going to go out of business if they don’t get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get to the second half of the year that it’s safe. And they can do it from a health point of view and so we need the – my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like day-by-day that’s happening. So that’s a little bit of color, obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there’s a real opportunity for this, I said this publicly, I think Bloomberg or Summer, but I do think there’s a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because it’s like everything, when you’re at the top of the cycle, we think everything’s going to stay good forever. And it’s a new norm. And when you’re looking from the bottom, the depths of doom you’re sort of trend lining off a lot of negativity and eventually this things going to flip and people want to get out no matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all clear sign is sort of given, which is the lights at the end of the tunnel, and I think coming soon. I think there’s a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year.
David Katz: Appreciate it. And if I may just a very quick follow-up. On the subject of hybrid segment or bleisure, any thought, strategies or marketing efforts to that end?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, all of our efforts on the marketing side, I mean, to keep it short and simple, if we can let other folks that ask questions, all of our efforts have been focused on fishing where the fish are. And right now, where the fish are at the moment is in sort of value based leisure and bleisure business. So and it’s really the bleisure part of it is small businesses that really don’t have the choice, but to travel to keep their businesses going. And they are sort of mixing it with leisure opportunities, because they have more mobility in a sense, they’re not locked into their kids aren’t locked into necessarily being in schools and they’re not locked into being in an office. So all of our efforts across what we’re doing with honors, what we’re doing with promotions, what we’re doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that. Now that’s all going to obviously shift. If all goes well and I’m right, you’ll – and we’re obviously working on the plans to not go immediately back to where we were, but to start to migrate back to sort of a more normal approach as demand patterns become more normalized.
David Katz: Thanks very much. Good luck.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling: On your comments on the second half 2021 trends, those are all helpful. Perhaps coming at from another angle, how did leisure business and group segments fair in China in the fourth quarter before incremental lockdowns? And how would you compare and contrast that market to the U.S. as you think about how it may inform the trajectory of recovery once cases are reined in. And perhaps as a related follow-up, are you seeing any signs of that substitution of trips that you were referencing in that market?
Chris Nassetta: Obviously China, as you’ve implied in your question, sort of backed up with what’s going on, particularly in the North of China, more than the South of China in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, I would say I don’t have all the data in front of me, but I would say the anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia-Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy meaning we weren’t fully back with there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it’s a heavier leisure market broadly, but we weren’t too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here. Leisure leads business transient is a close second. And the groups just because by nature group business a little bit longer, lead time is a little bit more planning was lagging a bit. But they – China – we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting before they backed up. We were getting to I think very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material as far as we could tell with the data we had any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID. And so I think while China is different in lots of ways, I think humans are humans. And I think it’s why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this leisure will lead, business transient will be a fast follow, group will take a little bit longer to develop, because lead times, but the demand patterns will over a couple of years return and look a lot like they did pre-COVID.
Stephen Grambling: And one very quick follow-up, just can you remind us what percentage of the China business is normally international inbound, which I imagine you’d have to overcome to get to that 10 points off.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. It’s about 10 points, 10%.
Stephen Grambling: Awesome. Thanks so much. I’ll jump back in queue.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Next question will be from Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Good morning, Chris and Kevin.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Bill.
Kevin Jacobs: Good morning, Bill.
Bill Crow: I got a two-parter on unit growth if I might. The first part of it is simply are there economic differences to Hilton between adding a conversion DoubleTree or say opening a Hampton Inn that has newly built and maybe that’s a year one versus a year three question?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean the difference is – I think you already answered sort of imply. It’s just timing. I mean conversions just happened faster most of not always in the year for the year, but typically between signing and getting them in the system and paying fees that happens very rapidly usually within 6 months to 12 months and signing of new builds depending on where in the world you are takes anywhere from 12 months to 48 months. And so conversions produce faster. I’d say in terms of ramps and underlying economics, I mean looking at Kevin runs development that’s not a material difference as I think about it. I don’t have the data in front of me, but anecdotally we’re involved. Kevin and I were involved in all these deals. I don’t think there’s any real difference in terms of, I think it just comes faster. I think the basic fee structures are quite similar.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, that’s right. I just think to DoubleTree’s 10 – DoubleTree’s are full service hotels, so its market specific, but the absolute level of these tends to be a little bit higher, but generally speaking the return profile is very similar.
Bill Crow: Perfect, perfect. The follow-up or the second part is whether you think the $15 national minimum wage would impact development economics for select service say your Tru hotels, which tend to be in smaller markets where maybe the labor rate is much lower.
Chris Nassetta: It could, I’ve been talking to lots of folks about this issue. And broadly, I think many including me are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I said to a number of people in the administration time and place sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is, I don’t know that it’ll end up in this first bill. I do think that there, I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I’m hearing possible, but not highly likely, but it will not be an issue that goes away. And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that first of all, even in what’s being proposed now, it’s not all to $15, it’s staged in over basically five years. And so I think that that creates a ramp that allows people to adjust and create, we’re obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it’s not like overnight, you go across the country to $15, by the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15. And so they’ve been dealing with it. I would also like to think that with people really spend the time figuring it out that not every market’s the same that living in Poughkeepsie is not the same as living in New York City. And that these can be index. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it’s the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don’t think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry. And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be rational, rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time. In fact, because it needs to, but again, I think it’s – I am hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there’ll be other mechanisms built in to the timing and the geographical approach that, that will make it make sense on all sides. So the short – that’s a long answer Bill. The short answer is I don’t think in the short to intermediate term there’s any meaningful impact as a result of it.
Bill Crow: Great.
Kevin Jacobs: And Bill I’ll just add, I mean that obviously covers the ground on the issue really well. I’ll just add as a quick plug for our products, right. And so our products on a relative basis, if you start with revenue premiums, and then our more modern prototypical, particularly you referenced Tru that even though if minimum – if wage and benefits costs go up, that does make it more expensive for developers, but on a relative basis, our products are more efficient. So it should continue to give us an opportunity to differentiate ourselves from a product perspective.
Chris Nassetta: And the last point not to hit it too hard is that the work we’re doing right now in every one of our brands including Tru and Hampton everything else is about taking – making them higher margin businesses and taking – creating more labor efficiencies, particularly in the areas of housekeeping, food and beverage and other areas. So they’re going to – when we get out of the crisis, those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-COVID. So that will also sort of factored for in my commentary. But I think that hopefully the net of it is as it goes up, it’s done over a longer period of time and it’s done in a sort of thoughtful way.
Bill Crow: Thank you for your time. Appreciate it.
Operator: Next question comes from Patrick Scholes with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Patrick.
Patrick Scholes: My question – morning, morning. I’m curious as to your interest at the moment in tuck-in brand acquisitions today versus sort of your historical normal strategy of building a brand from scratch, specifically interested in perhaps buying international brands or international private brands. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Thanks, Patrick. And good question. And one, we certainly – we get frequently. I don’t think my views changed at all. I mean I think I’ve been saying for 13 years, since we bought nothing, we’ve doubled. We’ve gone from a family of nine brands to 18 brands. So we’ve doubled it and in the time I’ve been here and we haven’t bought one of them. We’ve organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I’ve been saying, never say never, right. You’ve heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we’d consider it, but nothing has. And so I think not necessarily the past is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition. And so I would say never say never, but the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is – that can be proven, scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Everyone that we’ve developed we think is purpose built around exactly what customers want. And we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have that sort of meet that profile like we don’t want to go backwards, because we don’t have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something’s not covered, we could launch it. I don’t think you’ll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short-term. But why would we do that? We have all the segments generally covered. Do we want to cover, we have the best brands, why would we pick up something that wasn’t super curb in the same way that we then have to be distracted trying to fix. And that we paid a lot of money for the – yes, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do simple math, we’re developing these brands for nothing, not to make it. And so we have an infinite yield every time we do it, every time we do it through where a home to, and these things become mega brands, they become billion, multi-billion dollar businesses over time. It’s an infinite return because we’ve effectively invest just sweat equity, so something but not much. So when we look at buying stuff, we haven’t found anything that is perfect, that doesn’t require a lot of elbow grease. And you’re paying a lot of money for it. So we just not again never say never, but that’s sort of how we think about it now your comment – your question also implied like region sort of regional process that that’s where maybe I hate to say it and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we’re not going to do that, but there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren’t – that don’t show up a whole lot on the radar, but for what they are very, very good. And so, yes, we’ve looked at a bunch of those over time. And we will continue to do that. The net result has been while we’ve looked at a bunch of them, we haven’t done any. And again, I would say I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the no offense to our competitors. Maybe we had the best set up for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don’t want to bring stuff. We don’t want to bring stuff in that, that messes up the portfolio and we’re intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was – that those are my origins in business being a good capital allocator. And so when you put it together, I think not high likelihood, but never – not never impossible.
Patrick Scholes: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Next question will come from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you. I’m actually have two half questions since are both follow-ups. One is just on the group commentary and you talked about how much better the second half looks. I’ve got to think that for 2022, there will be group events that haven’t at that point taken place in three years. I’ve got to think your volume for 2022 would be better than 2019. Is it just too early to see that on your growth?
Chris Nassetta: Its too early. I think when we get into the second half of this year, that my own belief, I should hardly say this, but it’s like I said to our team the other day do not give away space in 2022 too cheap, like because I think there’s going to be gargantuan demand. And as a result, more pricing power than people think, just because you people have accumulated all sorts of needs that are going to get released and it takes time to plan. So what you’re going to see in the second half of this year is I think the big uptake will be in the SMERF business, because those are smaller groups they can have the planning is not as time consuming, the lead times are. The big stuff, it takes time when you’re doing a thousand person or multi-thousand person conventions. Even if you’re doing its hybrid, it takes a lot of planning. And so that’s really almost at this point got to start to fall in the next year or so. Yes. I think if all goes according to plan in the first half of this year with vaccinations and there’s a reality that, that people feel like they can start to congregate again being intelligent about it, but do it in a safe way. I think you’ll – in the second half of this year, you’ll see a bunch of demand that will dump into next year on stuff that requires planning.
Robin Farley: Great, super helpful. And then my other follow-up was on the unit growth comments. And I think your comments about next year were maybe better than what some had worried about maybe 2021 is benefiting from some of the construction in 2020 that had been delayed. So I guess when you talked about 4% to 5% for the next few years and this year being at the higher end of that. Does that sound like that maybe 2022 would be at the lower end leaner that there’s maybe going to be a little bit of an air pocket for new development that would have started in the last 12 months? Is that how we should kind of think about those?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I don’t think it would be that low. I think we are definitely, I mean we had 5.1% last year. We delivered a lot more than we thought. This is we look at this year, there’s a lot of stuff in production. We think again we have really good momentum on conversions, which is going to help us more this year than last it’ll help again, even more so in 2022. And then there’s just stuff that’s moving through that was under construction or was put under construction. That’s going to help us. I think next year, I mean we still – we put 75,000 rooms under construction last year, and most of that is not going to deliver this year. It’s going to deliver into next. And as I said, we’re ramping on conversion. So I do think that 2022 could be lower than 2021, but not by the degree that that you’re suggesting. I still think that ultimately our goal was to be sort of in that 4% to 5% range in all those years.
Robin Farley: Okay, great. Thanks very much.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Next question will be from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of questions on your conversations with owners. I used to talk about some upsides on the take rate as you sort of rolled contracts over. Just wondering as we’ve gone through this pandemic, are you able to enact on that and push the sort of fee percentages up. And also you gave them some CapEx holidays and how urgent is it they kind of begin that renovation process and when would you expect that to restart.
Chris Nassetta: Both good questions. So on the first, our published rates, you would say if you average all our brands it’s about 5.6% and license fees, we’re about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. I – we’re not going to anytime soon be increasing those rates in an absolute sense, but by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. I think I’m not saying anybody likes it, but that’s sort of the standard, the standard within the industry. It’s certainly what we’ve always done and we’ll continue to do that. So you’ll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously we can look at what we do with our fee structures, but we’re going to sort of keep, we think that they are good where they are and we’ll keep our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover. On the CapEx side, it’s really important. It’s a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of its product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent high quality product. We’re very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position, because we’ve been unbelievably diligent and disciplined. And our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums. They have to keep their assets up. And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place, we have the ability we think to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we’re going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest. It’s in our owners’ interest, if they want to continue to drive results. I suspect that that’s going to be next year and not this year. Just in the sense that while I think the second half we’re going to be in a very different world, we got to – we’re going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given again, the quality of – on average of our brands and the upkeep of those the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful.
Richard Clarke: Wonderful. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Hey Smedes.
Smedes Rose: Hi, I want to just follow-up on you talked about some of the group bookings improving sequentially, and I know it’s too early to talk about 2022, but on your patterns that you’re seeing, is there anything just from a geographic perspective in the U.S. that’s showing up so far in terms of maybe shifting away from higher costs cities that had already been underperforming from a RevPAR perspective in pandemic into lower cost?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. The geography is exactly what I think you’re following in the question and what you would think, it right now is less in the primary markets and more in the secondary and tertiary, just because of what’s been going on in a lot of the big cities and the greater density of population. And reality is, as I said a lot of the uptick that we’re seeing into the second half of the year is SMERF business. And the nature of that business lends itself more and more to those geographies. I fully expect as I said when we sort of get a bit of the all clear and people start to think about group in a very different way. And I hope that’s in the second half of the year, you’ll start to see those patterns normalize. But given that it is more in the SMERF segment it by definition ends up being more disproportionately outside of the big urban centers as compared to normal demand patterns at the moment.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you. And then just a very quick follow-up, I’m sorry if I missed this, but what was the impairment charge that you took in the quarter that was in an add back it’s just from the one that was related to.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, mostly in almost entirely in the ownership segment means we – this was announced in the pre-announcement for the bond deal as well on what we thought it was going to be both mostly goodwill related to the ownership segment that just having to do with the duration of the crisis and the recoverability of those assets and I’ll let you all on cash.
Smedes Rose: Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Again, thank you guys for joining us today. 2020 will go in the record books for sure. Not the greatest year for our company in our 101-year history or the industry certainly. But as I said in my prepared comments, we are proud of what we were able to accomplish. We think the businesses in a terrific position. We are certainly of the mind and hopeful as I’ve described in many ways that as we get to spring summer, and certainly in the second half of the year, we’re going to be in a very different place. And we’ll look forward after the first quarter, which will get us to the early spring to hopefully be able to comment on those positive trends. Thanks, again, and everybody stay well.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-11-04 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton's Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today.
 We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K as supplemented by our 10-Q filed on August 6, 2020.

Kevin Jacobs, our Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our third quarter results. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
 With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris. 
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everybody. We appreciate you joining us today, particularly after what might have been a very late night for many that are on the call.
 Our third quarter results continue to reflect the impact of COVID-19. However, I'm encouraged by the progress we've made over the last several months. Travel demand is gradually picking up around the world, and occupancy is meaningfully up from the lows we saw in April. As a result of these improvements, I'm pleased to say that we were able to welcome back most of our furloughed corporate team members last month. And we've been able to successfully navigate the first phase of reopening our corporate offices.
 We've reached important milestones with the vast majority of our properties around the world now open, development deals continuing to pick up and customers starting to feel more comfortable traveling again. We remain focused on sustaining our recovery and driving better results for our owners.
 Turning to the quarter, RevPAR declined approximately 60% year-over-year with performance in urban full-service hotels remaining particularly challenged due to the lack of meetings and events, negligible international travel and local COVID protocols. System-wide occupancy increased sequentially throughout the quarter with all major regions showing improvement. However, momentum slowed in September with occupancy only slightly better than August levels.
 In the U.S., occupancy increased roughly 5 points month-over-month in both July and August but remained largely steady in September. Over Labor Day weekend, roughly half of our properties achieved occupancy levels of 80% or higher given strong leisure demand. As expected, we saw leisure trends slow post summer, offset by a modest uptick in business transient into the fall.
 Asia Pacific led the recovery driven largely by domestic leisure travel in China, with occupancy levels reaching nearly 70% in August, the highest since December 2019. Performance in China was further boosted by local corporate transient and domestic group. In Europe, positive summer momentum stalled in September given a rise in coronavirus cases and tightening government restrictions, resulting in relatively stable occupancy levels of around 35% in August and September.
 Overall, these trends have generally continued into the fourth quarter with fairly steady occupancy as more hotels reopen and ramp, tempered by continued uncertainty surrounding the virus. With more than 97% of our global hotels open and operating, we estimate the vast majority of those hotels are running at breakeven occupancy levels or better. As we look to the balance of the year, we expect trends to remain relatively steady, resulting in fourth quarter RevPAR declines generally in line with the third quarter.
 On the development side, activity continues to pick up. In the quarter, we signed over 17,000 rooms, boosted by better-than-expected conversions, which increased approximately 50% year-over-year and accounted for roughly 20% of our total signings. Year-to-date, we command an industry-leading share of global conversion signings with more than 9,300 rooms signed, representing 1 in 5 deals. Recent notable signings included the Waldorf Astoria Monarch Beach in California and the Conrad Abu Dhabi Etihad Towers. These conversions plus new development projects like the Conrad Rabat Arzana in Morocco will further enhance our global luxury and resort footprints.
 In new development, we continue to see strong interest across our focus service brands, with signings up roughly 32% versus the second quarter. Additionally, we recently celebrated our 500th Hampton signing in China.
 At quarter end, our development pipeline totaled 408,000 rooms, representing an 8% increase versus prior year. Additionally, the high quality of our pipeline with more than half of our rooms under construction gives us confidence in our ability to continue delivering solid net unit growth for several years. We opened more than 17,000 rooms in the third quarter and achieved net unit growth of 4.7%.
 Openings in the Americas were up more than 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by conversions. Notable openings in the quarter included the Conrad Punta de Mita in Mexico and the Hilton Beijing Tongzhou in China. Additionally, we were thrilled to open the Motto by Hilton in Washington, D.C. City Center, marking our first hotel under the Motto brand.
 For the full year 2020, we now expect net unit growth to be 4.5% to 5% with continued positive momentum in conversions. Additionally, we look forward to celebrating our 1 millionth room milestone in coming weeks. Since our team came in and implemented the company's transformation 13 years ago, we've doubled our size in rooms and number of brands, driven entirely by organic growth.
 Our commitment to delivering on our customers' evolving needs and preferences is even more important now than ever before and calls for even greater innovation and agility in the current environment. To that end, we were excited to launch WorkSpaces by Hilton, which provides guests a clean, flexible and distraction-free environment for productive remote working. Each of our day use rooms includes a spacious desk, a comfortable ergonomic chair, free WiFi plus the use of all available business and leisure amenities.
 We also announced further enhancements to previous Hilton Honors program modifications that will increase flexibility for our more than 110 million members, including reducing 2021 status qualifications and extending status and points expiration. Decisive actions, relentless determination and unwavering commitment to our core values have helped us successfully navigate what has been a challenging and uncertain environment.
 They have also helped position us well for recovery. We're confident that our business model, coupled with our disciplined strategy, will enable us to further differentiate ourselves in the industry and emerge stronger and more efficient than ever before.
 With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the third quarter. 
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 60% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis, with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Occupancy drove the majority of the declines with rate pressure due largely to customer mix, further hampering performance. However, we saw sequential improvement throughout the quarter driven by hotel reopenings, loosening travel restrictions in most areas and a pickup in summer leisure demand, particularly in China and the U.S.
 Adjusted EBITDA was $224 million in the third quarter, declining 63% year-over-year. Results reflect the continued reduction in global travel demand due to the pandemic and related temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter.
 Management and franchise fees decreased 53%, driven by RevPAR declines. Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at both the corporate and property levels with corporate G&A expense down approximately 38% year-over-year.
 Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to temporary closures, fixed operating costs and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Cost control measures mitigated losses across the portfolio. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.06.
 Turning to liquidity. We ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.5 billion. Our cash burn rate improved in the third quarter given gradual recovery in the macro environment, further helped by continued cost discipline and better-than-expected collections. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our liquidity position and ability to navigate the current environment and recovery. Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.
 This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. 
Carlo Santarelli: Guys, just in terms of the pipeline, obviously, you guys talked about kind of 3.5% to 4% was the expectation for this year. You obviously spoke to the high end of that range. Now obviously, looking for more, Chris, you spoke a lot in your prepared remarks about kind of the impact of conversions and that the percentage of conversions, I believe, you said was 20% of the 17,000 rooms signed in the quarter.
 As we move out further into 2021, 2022, et cetera, could you talk a little bit about the role that you're foreseeing for forward conversion means to net unit growth? And maybe potentially also talk about kind of what changed this year. Is it just more construction timing and things kind of getting back, started in terms of hotels that were close to the finish line? Maybe a little bit in advance of when you thought they would? 
Christopher Nassetta: Sure. There's a bunch there, but let me unpack it. I think I can pretty succinctly do that. Yes, starting with this year, our numbers have been moving up over the last 3 or 4 months on net unit growth now to being 4.5% to 5%, and that is exactly what you suggested in the question. That's because things have gotten back under construction more rapidly than we were initially assuming, and that means that we're just delivering more this year than we thought we would, which is a good thing.
 And in conversions, while the bulk of that benefit is going to be seen, I think, in '21 and '22, just because of the lag effect, we are seeing more conversions in the year for the year than we had been anticipating, which was reflected in signings being up in the third quarter by 50%. So the flow-through of that is how we're getting to the 4.5% to 5%.
 I think as you think about conversions going forward, last year, it was -- and I'll do this directionally because it's very early, and obviously, we're not giving specific guidance. But directionally, last year, we were in the high teens in terms of the percentage of our NUG that was in conversions. This year, we obviously will see an uptick, 400 or 500 basis points on that. Again, recognizing that there's a lag, even though these happen a lot faster than new builds, there is time to renovate properties in many cases, get them into our systems and the like.
 So we'll be -- if we're in the teens, we'll be in the low to mid-20s. And I think that number will keep creeping up. I've said many times over the years, in the last -- in the Great Recession, I think we peaked out close to 40%. I don't think we will get that high, even though in this world, we have more brands to play with in the sense that then we really had one in DoubleTree. Now we have DoubleTree and 3 soft brands. We're bigger. We have a broader development story than we did from a global point of view in those days.
 And so I do think it will grow from low to mid-20s beyond that in '21 and '22. And you sort of asked it, and I know it's on everybody's mind. And so while I'm on development and NUG, I'll finish the story is we -- it's very early, and I wouldn't take this as like hard guidance, but I would take it like everything else in COVID world as a good direction, and we've done a lot of work around it.
 As we think about NUG and as we've talked about, certainly, in the last call, over the next few years, we think it's probably best we can tell in the 4% to 5% range. We're going to be a little bit obviously better than that this year. Next year, we have a bunch of stuff that will deliver that's been in motion, conversions. But we feel comfortable in that range because even though we will have a drop off, obviously and naturally as a result of fewer things getting put under construction because of the financing markets right now, we still have a lot that already is in production and coming through. And we will supplement that with conversions, which, by definition, effectively have already been financed.
 So I think that's the way I would think about this year. That's the way I think about the next few years that we're sort of somewhere in that 4 to 5 zone, trying to be more precise than that at this point, I think, would be difficult. But we'll obviously keep you updated as time goes on. 
Carlo Santarelli: And Chris, if I could, just a quick follow-up on your response there. That 4% to 5% range, is there an air pocket anywhere in there as you think about kind of maybe the financing [ glob ] that could potentially kind of impact the 2022 or 2023, whatever may be in the lead time? Or do you think that's pretty consistent and steady? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. And Carlo, I -- it depends on how much success we have in filling what will be a decline in newbuilds with conversions. And it's just -- looking that far out is hard to do. That's why I would just direct you to, at the moment, the 4% to 5%. And I think best that we can model it, and that's all it is for us. But it's based on a lot of experience and the trajectory we see and what's already in the pipeline and what's already under construction and what we see in activity and conversions.
 We think the next few years will be within those boundaries. It doesn't mean it will be in the middle every year. It could bounce up and down a little bit based on our projections. But that's about as precise as we could be in the moment. 
Operator: The next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. 
Joseph Greff: Chris, Kevin, you did a commendable job and have been doing a commendable job on controlling G&A costs. And I know you have some of the furlough impacts in the G&A line and not replicating themselves going forward.
 And not so much for the fourth quarter, but just maybe over the next couple of years, maybe you can just talk about big picture how do you think, in a RevPAR and fee recovery scenario, how you bring back incremental G&A expenses. What is that relationship?  So I don't know if you want to think of it this way. In other words, if we think about 2022 with -- you're at 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever that number is, '22 RevPAR as a percentage of 2019, what is that relationship-wise for G&A, looking back at 2019 as a baseline? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think, look, obviously, it's a very fair question, and I think you've identified some of the offsetting things, right? I mean I think if you think about -- I know you didn't ask about the fourth quarter. But if you think about the fourth quarter, it's a similar dynamic for '21 and '22, right, where you sort of lose the benefit of the furloughs that we had over the course of the second and third quarter. But you gain the run rate benefit of the reductions in force that we've had and some of the other cost control measures that we've put in place.
 So I'd say, look, I mean, sort of similar answer to NUG, it's a little bit early to be giving you a refined look at 2021 and certainly 2022. But the way we're thinking about it is that most of these savings should be semi-permanent, meaning there will be a point at which the business grows to the point a few years from now where you have to start adding back. But for the foreseeable future, most of the savings should be semi-permanent. And we ought to grow plus or minus inflation over the next couple of years, and that's probably as much guidance as we're comfortable giving you at this point. 
Operator: The next question is from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Shaun Kelley: So Kevin, in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about just sort of where we are with the cash burn piece. And I was just wondering, can you just kind of lay out for us directly or clearly, is the corporate entity sort of on a run rate or a monthly basis? Or are you guys at cash burn neutral or even positive at this point? Or what does it take to get there?
 And then maybe as the follow-up, just straight up, it would be how are kind of the broader working capital and franchisee collections going? How is that relationship with franchisees playing out? And how would you characterize some of the risk around any collection at this point? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Shaun. Look, I think the -- I'll take the second part first. I think the answers are obviously pretty very related. The relationship we have with our owners, I'd describe as really positive, I mean, just to put that framework out there. I think everybody is doing the best they can. And I think people, to the extent that they can pay us, are paying us.
 And obviously, you saw over the third quarter with a burn of plus or minus $100 million. That was sort of, I think, better than most people's expectations, including our own. So, so far, we're having a very good experience on collections. And again, everybody is doing the best they can.
 In terms of going forward, are we at breakeven? I'd say we're getting there. I think all things being equal on collections, and if we have a similar experience over the course of the fourth quarter, I'd say we'll be equal to or maybe slightly better than the third quarter will be the fourth quarter experience, again, if things kind of go the way we think they're going to go or they go the way they've been going.
 We do have a couple of timing items like we have a pretty large interest expense payment that just hit in October and things like that. But again, I think all things being equal, it will be equal to or better than the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And what does it take to get to cash flow positive? We're almost there, probably just a little bit more -- a little bit better demand and a little bit better operating performance then you're there. 
Operator: The next question is from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. 
Stephen Grambling: Maybe combining both Carlo and -- Carlo's question earlier. You've had, obviously, really solid net unit growth and solid cost control. If we put these 2 together, what level of RevPAR decline versus 201 would you think you would be back to 2019 EBITDA levels but perhaps taking it one step further to 2019 levels of free cash flow? And what are some of the other puts and takes to think about that might influence that? 
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks for the question. Obviously, it's a little bit difficult to be precise with you in the sense of building the model for you as much as I'd like to. And we do have a model, and if you put those 2 things together, I think that's sort of implied in your question, is you will get to free cash flow and EBITDA levels of '19 before you necessarily get back to demand levels of '19 because you have created a much more efficient cost structure.
 I think that is a reasonable assumption, and that is certainly what our models would show that when we get to the other side, because of what Kevin said and what I said, we will keep growing throughout. We will have more units producing on more normalized levels of demand against a lower cost base. The math is pretty easy. That means we're -- when we get to the other side of this and we're on a more normal time, we're a meaningfully higher-margin business because we have cut a lot of costs and we're going to continue to keep those costs out of the business with some basic inflationary pressures on growth.
 And so I can't give you a number. We're not going to give guidance of any sort, particularly multiple years out. But I think if you do basic math and assume what we've already said publicly, you can pretty easily get there. You can see what we're saying in unit growth. You can make your assumptions on REVPAR. We've given pretty solid guidance on.
 We think our G&A structure is going to be down 25% to 30% this year. My guess is it will be towards the higher end of that when it's all said and done, and then it's just arithmetic after that. So we're not going to finish the arithmetic part of it. We'll let you do it. But I think your baseline, I think what is implied in the question is correct. We will get to EBITDA and free cash flow of '19 before we would get to demand levels of '19 for those reasons. 
Stephen Grambling: Right. And I guess one other just quick follow-up is just as we think about working capital or other components of cash flow, whether it's CapEx or otherwise, is there anything there that we should be cognizant of that could be different relative to where you were trending kind of pre COVID? 
Christopher Nassetta: I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I mean, obviously, on CapEx, we've reduced CapEx numbers in this environment like every -- pretty much everybody on earth, certainly in our industry and most industries. I think as we get back to that, I think there's -- that will normalize and be more like it was, but there'll be efficiencies, I think, we'll garner on that. And I think, again, when you get to a normalized environment, I think the working capital things sort of go back to the way they were. 
Operator: The next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. 
Thomas Allen: So thank you for the color earlier that you kind of expect fourth quarter RevPAR trends to be similar to third quarter. But can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing right now by region? Obviously, we can look at third quarter results, but you're seeing increased closures in Europe. I'd be curious to hear how -- if APAC continue to improve or not. And then just related, corporate rate negotiations should be going on right now. Kind of what are you hearing through those conversations? 
Christopher Nassetta: Okay. Great, Thomas. Yes, there's a lot there, too, but let me unpack it and see if I can. I'm not one for being succinct, as you know, but let me try and be. So regionally, it's pretty much what you guys have been writing about and what you've been seeing. The here and now is that notwithstanding what's going on in the U.S., forget the election but resurgence in coronavirus cases. We've seen here sort of steady, steady as she goes, so to speak. We haven't seen any material backward activity in terms of mobility and demand.
 Now depending on what happens, you could, but we have -- we've seen it remain reasonably steady. I'd say Europe and Middle East is going backwards modestly for the reasons that you would expect. And so as we think about the fourth quarter, we've more recently been sort of knocking our numbers and expectations down because of lockdowns. That's sort of obvious.
 If you look at Latin America, I would say, so goes the U.S., sort of Latin America is generally in keeping in terms of trajectory. And then Asia Pacific, really led by China. I think outside of China, Asia Pacific feels a lot like what's going on in the U.S. I hate to make it all one big bucket. But if you put it all together, it sort of does. And then China, as has been well documented, continues to sort of motor along. And we continue to see pickup in travel in all segments.
 And so when you put it all together, Europe is definitely going a bit backwards. Asia continues to move a little bit forward. U.S. is sort of steady, and that's kind of why we get to a fourth quarter that's about where we are. If we look at October numbers, which we don't have final numbers, but that sort of supports it.
 There is risk in it. I'm not going to deny. I mean depending on what goes on here in the U.S. and other parts of the world with the virus, there's risk. It could go back, whereas our best sense of it is at the moment is people are sort of figuring out how to manage their own risk profile. And as a result, they're getting -- there's a lot of data and information out there as long as their countries aren't locking them down. And I think it's unlikely the U.S. will lock down the whole country. There is some level of mobility that I think will likely allow us to maintain this level of sort of operations that we've been seeing for a period of time.
 And then the next step is, like when do you see the next step change? And my own view is I think you see that in the spring. I think we sort of hold our own between here and there. I think that we'll get an election behind us, which will take some of the air out of the balloon regardless of outcome. I believe that you will start to see a lot coming out of the vaccine world particularly, maybe more out of the therapy world.
 But vaccines on multiple -- in multiple cases, that will have some level of effectiveness that will be able to be mass-produced sometime late this year, early next year, you get through the winter season, the flu season. And I think there's a real opportunity for a step change in attitude and as a result, a step change in performance.
 As we look at our segments, they're sort of reflective of that. Not necessarily they all agree with me, but it's sort of -- that's what you see going on. Leisure is sort of coming off the summer season. On the last call, we said we thought leisure would be stronger into the fall than normally just because people aren't open -- offices aren't open. In a lot of cases, kids aren't back at school, so people have more mobility for leisure purposes. That's exactly what's happened.
 We've seen continued strength, not as much at the summer, but continued strength. We've definitely seen a pickup in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of business travel. It's not the traditional customer en masse that we would typically be housing, but business travel is picking up.
 And group, there is group. I mean in the third quarter, we did about 10% group, which is probably about half of what we've normally done. The groups are different. They're more related to the crisis, sports teams, things like that, but there is some group. But the big return of the group, I think, doesn't really occur until -- hopefully, you get to that moment that I talked about next spring, where we're sort of shifting into a different gear in terms of the health crisis and vaccines.
 As it relates to the last question, I think, I unpacked it all, corp rate negotiations. We've actually done really well. I mean I think the biggest issue on corporate rate negotiations is really how many people are going to show up. Less to me about the rate, although obviously, rates are important, but like, how many people are going to show up under those programs next year? Premature to say. I think it will follow the trends broadly, macro trends that I just described that I think give at least -- or what I believe.
 In terms of rate negotiations, we've had great success. Everybody knows it's a really difficult time. We're now through the majority of those negotiations. And in the majority of cases, our customers have agreed to keep the 2020 rate structure. Not in every case, but in the majority of the cases, they've agreed to do that, recognizing the difficulties of the times. And so we feel actually pretty good about that. Hopefully, that answers your questions plus a little color. 
Operator: And the next question is from David Katz with Jefferies. 
David Katz: Good to hear you're all well. You have largely addressed the 2 major buckets that I wanted to ask you about, but I'd like to just take the prior question a little bit further. How much thinking have you sort of put into flexible strategies around what ifs, if the timings on therapeutics and so forth or the effectiveness of distribution, et cetera? And I mean, specifically around the buckets of demand, which have included a majority from business versus leisure and how you sort of fill up your buckets should you have to as things move forward. 
Christopher Nassetta: That's a great question and one we talk about around the table I'm sitting at every Monday morning when we have our executive committee meeting. I mean the reality is, as you might guess, David, while that is -- I gave you a view of what I think, and I think most of our team thinks will be the -- sort of the contour of the recovery from this point forward. We're not counting on that. That is what we think, that is what we hope. Time will tell. I mean as my father used to say, "Son, fish where the fish are." And right now, the fish are where they are, which is certain -- a lot of leisure, frankly, not the typical leisure customers, the lower-rated leisure still. And business travel is a different type of business, smaller business, sales forces, frontline folks responding to the crisis.
 The group business, again, isn't the traditional group, but there are groups out there that are having to meet. We're housing a lot of -- nobody's back -- a lot of people aren't back in offices, so they need to have places to congregate, to have meetings since they're not in their office. You heard me talk about WorkSpaces by Hilton, using rooms as workspaces, particularly for people that need to get out of the house and need WiFi and need some space and privacy.
 And so I could keep going. All our marketing campaigns have shifted, as you've seen, if you've been watching that. All our efforts with Honors have shifted and pivoted. So we're quite mindful of what is going on, where the fish are, to use my metaphor, and intensely focused with our commercial teams on delivering and getting more than our fair share, which I'm happy to say we are. If I look at our relative results in this environment, we're doing very well vis-à-vis share, so we will continue doing that.
 But then the trick is, this isn't going to last forever. And so it's not like this will be our new strategy forever. It's great. We're honing some new skills that we didn't need to have. And when we get to the other side of this and we get back a more normal demand environment, we won't have -- let those muscles atrophy. But now we'll have other skills -- other tools in our toolkit, and pricing is all about generating a lot of demand. The more demand you can generate, the higher the price you can charge.
 And so as we think about it, it's sort of like really dig in and refine this toolkit. And as we get back to more normal times, take the best of both worlds to put more demand in the funnel to ultimately, intermediate and longer term, be able to price accordingly.
 We're super crazy focused. And think about it, we have -- we're a fiduciary for thousands of owners that are in the most difficult circumstances in their careers because this is the worst thing our industry has seen. And our job is to make sure that we're helping them build the bridge to the other side of this. And so it's one foot in the here and now, one foot in the future, but both solidly planted. 
Operator: And our next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. 
Robin Farley: I wanted to go back to the topic of unit growth because I know you mentioned conversions were 20% of total signings in the quarter. I'm just wondering what percent of openings they were in the quarter just given the increase in your unit growth since last quarter. I'm wondering if that's conversion's driving... 
Christopher Nassetta: They were about 20% in the quarter. And they'll be, as I think I already suggested in a prior comment, a bit more that for the full year. But we do expect that, that -- those percentages will creep up in '21 and '22. 
Robin Farley: So the increase in your unit growth for this year from just a quarter ago sequentially, is that more just construction projects getting back on track faster? I didn't know that, that was... 
Christopher Nassetta: It's both. It's both. We're doing more. I mean while most of the benefit of conversions is going to happen in '21 and '22, we're getting some deals done that the world is opening up fast enough where we're going to open a bunch of incremental conversion hotels in the year for the year that we didn't think we'd open. Plus, yes, now I'd say the vast majority of things that were under construction, 90-plus percent of what was under construction when we went into the crisis is back under construction. And they're making really good progress.
 So we assume sort of a lag effect that when things got up and going, it would take a while for things to wind back up. But honestly, the construction trades around the world, particularly here in the U.S., were ready to go, and they've been worked -- ready to work. And so activity picks up a lot faster. So we're just -- those 2 reasons are why we're delivering more this year. 
Robin Farley: And then just when we think about maybe some that did get pushed into next year just from your kind of pre-COVID original guidance, it sounded like your guidance for next year is in that kind of 4% to 5% range. Are there some things that were originally in next year's openings that just have kind of fallen off that didn't end up going forward? 
Christopher Nassetta: Not much, no. I don't think much changed. A little bit more will open this year, which would have probably -- we would have assumed would have pushed into next year. So that pulls a little bit of that out of next year into this year. But we still feel -- as I said, it's not being evasive. It's just really early to be hyper precise. I mean we can -- at this point, we're deep enough in the year that 4.5% to 5%, we can be pretty precise because some stuff might fall in or out. But over the next few years, that's what I said, we think we're in the 4% to 5% range, and we're not -- you'll have to give us some time to ultimately get a little bit closer to be more precise. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Robin, I'd just add a little bit to that. I mean I think the way you're thinking about it logically makes perfect sense. I think, though, you got to think about when we first said, half or a little bit better. We were at the very beginning of the crisis in the depths of it. And construction -- and a lot of construction, as Chris said, had been suspended, and we really didn't know when it was going to come back online. So we're just -- we're further into it. We've had a better experience with construction getting back up and running than we thought. And I wouldn't sort of overthink the way it affects the future years. 
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow with Raymond James. 
William Crow: Chris, given the positive comments from Kevin on the cash burn nearing 0 and your discussion of cost cuts and margins going forward, I'm just wondering how much confidence level you could provide that you might return to share repurchases as we look forward to 2021? 
Christopher Nassetta: I think that's a really good question. I think it's a little bit premature. We have not changed long term our philosophy on return of capital. And that is -- we believe, when we're back in a more normalized environment, that we're going to produce gargantuan amounts of free cash flow. We don't need a lot of that to grow because we've got the best brands in the business, and we think we can continue to grow organically. Thus, that capital is best given back to our shareholders, largely in the form of buybacks.
 Our philosophy hasn't changed. It's a little bit premature to say exactly when we get back on that program. Obviously, our leverage levels have gone up as a result. If you look at our net debt, it actually won't have gone up year-over-year. But our  EBITDA, as you guys can calculate in your models, even though we haven't given you guidance, has gone way down. So we're going to want to see our debt-to-EBITDA levels come down before we start back up with a share repurchase program.
 That doesn't mean, by the way, that it has to come necessarily all the way back down to the ranges that we've historically said. But we'd want to see that we are solidly 2 feet in the ground in the next stages of recovery and that our debt-to-EBITDA levels are headed towards a more normalized level.
 And given where we are now, which isn't feeling really good about where we are and great about our liquidity and thinking the spring is going to be when we shift gears, I think all of those things, I said all these things, that we have to -- we want to see those things happen. So I think it's a fabulous question. I know people want to know. Hopefully, that gives you some context how we think about it. But we're not in a position at this moment to say when exactly that will be. 
Operator: And the next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. 
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you, you noted about 97% of the rooms are open. So I realize it's a small percentage of the room base that's closed. But is that skewing -- that chunk of like 25,000 to 30,000 rooms, is that skewing towards the owned and leased portfolio? Or is it more across the board? And do you see any of those maybe not reopening? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think the vast majority will open, to answer the last one first. There may be a few here and there that don't. But I think it skews very heavily to urban destinations in the U.S. and then Europe. That's what it skews very heavily towards. I mean, obviously, with Europe going backwards, we still had more to open in Europe, and now they've gone back and locked down. So our progress there slowed. We may have some hotels go back into suspension in Europe. And then in the U.S., it's almost entirely big urban hotels -- the big urban markets that are suffering the most. 
Smedes Rose: So does that would -- so I guess then it would skew also to kind of the owned and leased portfolio, which I know is small, but it just... 
Christopher Nassetta: Well, no. As we -- we don't -- actually, all of our owned and leased hotels are open at the moment. Now we do have some hotels that are in some of the parts of the world that are going back on lockdown... 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, we did... 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, in Europe and the U.K. But -- so we could have some that go back. But at the moment, all of our owned and leased hotels are open. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, it skews. It skews heavily towards the management franchise, almost -- well, I would say very heavily towards managed and to a lesser degree, franchised. 
Operator: The next question is from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. 
Richard Clarke: I just want to ask a question on loyalty. How much has loyalty been a boost to your cash flow through the last couple of quarters? Are you still getting money from the credit cards? And I suppose as the follow-up to that, you'll probably come out of this crisis with a bigger loyalty liability than you normally would have. And how do you think about managing that with regard to cash flow over the next couple of years? And how does that feed into your thoughts about what the balance sheet should look like? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Rich, I'd say generally, I don't think we will come out of this with a materially higher liability than we have. If you think about the -- it's a complicated equation of what we take in and what we put on the balance sheet in terms of the liability. But it all -- it does self-regulate in the sense that when rates are lower, the cost of redemptions is lower, the folio charges are lower.
 And we run the whole thing generally breakeven. And so it's not a material contributor either way to our cash flow. There is a portion of the credit card remuneration that is ours. As you can imagine, credit card spend is down. So those -- that remuneration is down, although not nearly as much as RevPAR. So it's not a big swing one way or the other. 
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with Truist. 
Charles Scholes: I wonder if you could comment about what you're observing for group booking and cancellation trends for both 1Q and 2Q of next year? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. Well, it's probably not going to shock you. I mean we are a booking business, by the way, in the year for the year still and not in significant amounts. But as I said earlier, it's for unique types of group meetings, smaller corporate meetings in lieu of people being in the office, sports-related group and groups related to recovery efforts and crisis-related efforts.
 As you look at more traditional group bookings or rebookings, because obviously, our objective is to try and rebook everything evenly possible that is getting canceled this year. And we've done, I think, a very good job of doing that. I would say at this point, while we're booking a lot of -- booking and rebooking increasingly significant business into next year, I would say very little of it is into Q1. Some of it is into Q2, and the bulk of it is into Qs 3 and 4.
 And that's for the reasons -- it's sort of been implied in most of what I've said. I think everybody is sort of like on hold for the winter season. Let's get through the flu season, let's get these vaccines sorted out through Phase III and see if we can't start putting shots in people's arms.
 And so if you're planning a big group meeting, you just -- at this point that you're in November, you're not doing it in the first quarter. You're a little hesitant on second quarter, although some of that's happening. But the bulk of what we're booking, which is picking up at a pretty good velocity is in the second half of next year and beyond. 
Operator: The next question is from Anthony Powell with Barclays. 
Anthony Powell: You mentioned that you saw interest in your select service brands. Could you maybe sell from [ whom or they're from ] new developers, different types of owners? And given kind of the relative resilience of that segment, the cycle, could that lead to more interest in those brands going forward and a higher share for you in the development pipeline at a peak in the next cycle? 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think it's -- commonsensically, the reason we're seeing it is because I do believe we have a lot of owners that are still very, very strong. I think they're of the mind that if you're going to build, the best time to build is during down cycles so that you deliver things into an up cycle. I think many of them fall into our sort of select service development community.
 And they're looking at this as an opportunity to maybe pick better sites with the best brands and sort of lock their position and then go out and see if they can get it financed and get it going with the belief that they'll deliver into a significant upswing. And so I would say there's certainly some -- I mean I'd just let -- Kevin answered it. There's certainly some new owners. But I'd say it's really our -- almost all of it, my sense is, anecdotally, is from our existing owner base.
 The other thing is, this is the stuff that can get done, right? I mean, by the way, this was the trend pre COVID. The bulk of -- if you look at the U.S., particularly, the bulk of what was getting done in the U.S. was all in the limited service space. That was true then. It's even more true now just in terms of the economic model behind it, the margins that they can run, cost to build and all that fun stuff.
 So I think it's -- I don't think it's a particularly new thing. I think our brands are really, really strong. They deliver incredible share. I think people want to take advantage of the crisis to position themselves with the best opportunities for when they get to the other side. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. And probably just worth adding, Anthony, we did mention that in the prepared remarks. That was quarter-over-quarter growth, I think, in signings in focused service. I'd say, broadly speaking, the skew between existing owners and new owners, probably a little bit more existing because I just think you have to be pretty well healed in the development world to get something done at this point.
 But worth noting that our -- both our approvals and signings over the course of the third quarter were about 1/3 full service, 2/3 limited select service or focused service and pretty well distributed geographically. And that's all pretty consistent with prior -- what we -- our experience in prior quarters and prior years. So not a lot new there. 
Operator: The next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. 
Jared Shojaian: Can you just talk about how occupancy trends have evolved in China? Specifically, where is business travel versus leisure travel today versus the prior peak? And then just one unrelated clarification. When you say G&A down 25% to 30%, does that mean the entire year in 2020 is down 25% to 30%? Or should we assume fourth quarter is also down 25% to 30%, and that's the run rate level going forward? 
Christopher Nassetta: That is the full year 2020, and I'll let Kevin talk about China. 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. In China, for -- during the third quarter, China was about 50% leisure, 30% corporate, 20% group. So that was a little bit less leisure and a touch more group than in prior quarters. I actually don't have in front of me where it was to prior peak. I suspect still skewed more towards leisure than it would have been on a normalized basis. 
Operator: And the next question is from Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. 
Vince Ciepiel: I wanted to touch a bit on distribution. Could you talk about what you've seen over the last couple of quarters in terms of direct business versus OTA share? And if coming through this pandemic, as you evaluate the distribution going into next year or years into the future on a recovery of demand, you've made great strides driving more direct business. I'm just curious if this changes that at all or further accelerates the gains you've seen on that path. 
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I don't think -- I mean what's interesting is I don't -- long term, I don't think it changes anything. I think if you looked at like our OTA percentages through Q2, they were tracking pretty consistent with where we've been over the last couple of years. Q3, they were up as we would have expected, just given the base of business, which was non-frequent, non-loyal leisure business during the summer that was -- that is more OTA-oriented. So it was up not in any alarming way, but it was up. And we expected it, and we wanted it to be up in the sense that we wanted access to those customers.
 Our attitude on the long term hasn't changed. Our attitude with the OTAs is they've been good partners for certain types of business. We love working with them through the crisis. There's been plenty of pockets of demand that have been helpful to us and our ownership community work with them on. But at the same time, as you point out, we've been on a long-term trajectory.
 And during COVID, similarly, to build more direct relationships, build more loyalty, give customers more reasons through what we're doing with our digital platform, what we're doing with Honors, that value proposition and the like, what we're doing now with CleanStay and cleanliness and hygiene and all of the things that have come out of the COVID crisis to give people more reason to want to come directly to us.
 And so in a more normalized demand environment, I think the things that we've done in the crisis are going to put us in a really good position to continue down the path of building even more direct relationships and even more direct business. In the interim, we're going to obviously do a bit more business with the OTAs because it's the right thing to do.
 In terms of distribution mix, the majority of our distribution comes from direct channels. Almost 3/4 of it comes from direct channels. I mean the thing that's been interesting, there's been some shift outs, which wouldn't surprise you. I mean if you had asked me this a year ago, I would have said, "Gosh, it's hard to imagine." But what's happened is our percentage of direct has stayed about the same. It's just shifted where hotel direct has gone way up, and our -- and digital channels, other channels have gone down, which seems crazy, but it's just the type of business. And people -- literally, we have 2/3 of our businesses booked within 7 days and like 40% of it almost is booked within the day. And so it's a lot of like drive-through business. People pick up the phone and call like the old days. Obviously, that won't be maintained.
 And then the OTA swap-out, so the OTAs have gone up a little bit. But what has gone down is the GDS on the other side. We could argue about GDS sort of effectively being a direct channel the way we think about it, but we don't. But what has happened is the GDS has gone down because the traditional corporate business that comes through that has evaporated to a large extent, and it's been replaced by OTA-type business.
 So ironically, when you net it all out, we're almost in the exact same place. But sort of a funny world for the moment, I have every expectation as we get to more typical demand levels that those things will all go back to more normal -- a more normal trajectory. And I feel very good about what we're doing vis-à-vis Honors and our customers to keep building direct relationships. 
Operator: The next question will be from Rich Hightower with Evercore. 
Richard Hightower: I was hoping to get you to opine a little bit on short-term rentals. And when you think about the recovery and maybe some share gains in that segment over the course of the summer and through Labor Day, did that surprise you at all? And Chris, you've made comments in the past about how it's not precisely the same customer that Hilton is going after, but would you make that same statement today? 
Christopher Nassetta: Good, a really good question. And it doesn't really change my view in the sense that I won't make you suffer through the whole thing because you guys know us. But I do believe that's fundamentally a different business. We're in the branded business where we take very consistent product, very consistent service delivery, amenities wrapped in with a product, loyalty, we wrap it all together, and we sell it for a premium versus something that satisfies the customers' needs But is not going to have the consistency, the service, the amenities. Could have loyalty, but at the moment, it doesn't really have loyalty and it results -- as a result, more of a value proposition.
 I just think we fundamentally believe we're in the hospitality business and we get the premiums we get because we do something different and that our business is good and that their business is good, right? But they're -- and while they're related, they're -- fundamentally, we're trying to do different things.
 Now I'm not at all surprised. I had every expectation that this would be good for them. Just think about what I said about where the business is coming from. The bulk of the business this summer was value-oriented leisure business. That is like a bull's eye for those platforms. And so that's great for them.
 And if you had an expectation that, that is all the demand that was going to be available, that this was a secular shift, it would be an issue. I do not believe that. I believe that when we wake up in 2 or 3 years and incrementally over those 2 or 3 years, we will get back to a more normalized environment in terms of demand. And that what we do, that people have been willing to pay a big premium for, they will continue as we get through this crisis to want to stay with us and pay us that premium.
 They will also, for certain stay occasions, want to stay with them for a different type of value proposition. So it wasn't surprising to us at all. It makes all the sense in the world just given the -- if you look at the bucket of demand, the biggest bucket of demand that's out there at the moment. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks. 
Christopher Nassetta: Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us. I hope everybody that didn't get rest get some rest today. We'll see what happens with all of these crazy elections here in the U.S. We appreciate the time. Obviously, a lot going on in the world, a lot going on with the business. We feel, as I said in my comments, really good about the progress.
 I think we're set up, certainly from a liquidity point of view, in a really good place, but I also think in terms of what we've been doing for our ownership community, what we've been doing with our customers, how we've been taking care of our teams, what we've been doing from a cost structure point of view. I do believe in my heart of hearts that when we get to the other side of this, we're a bigger, better, stronger, more efficient higher-margin business.
 And so we'll look forward to continuing to update you on -- as the journey unfolds. Thanks, and have a great day. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-08-06 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton’s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s second quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K supplemented by our 10-Q filed on May 7, 2020. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment; Kevin Jacobs, Chief Financial Officer and President, Global Development, will then review our second quarter results. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Before we get started, I would like to offer our sympathies to all those affected by the recent explosion in Beirut, our thoughts are with our team members and everybody impacted by this tragic event. It goes without saying that these past several months have been challenging. While we have continued to navigate the global coronavirus pandemic and its impact on our business and the communities we serve globally. Here in the U.S., we have also witnessed tragic acts of social injustice leading to difficult, but necessary discussions regarding systemic inequalities. For more than a century, our hotels have been a welcoming place for all, a place where we bring together people of all backgrounds and connect them to the light and warmth of our hospitality. Now more than ever, Hilton remains committed to fostering an inclusive culture and driving positive change in our communities and society more broadly. Building on the work we have been doing, we have set even more aggressive leadership diversity targets across our corporate and hotel teams. As we announced yesterday, we are happy to welcome Chris Carr to our board of directors. Chris brings several decades of executive leadership across global consumer companies and we look forward to his insights and diversity of thoughts as we focus on our near-term recovery and long-term growth opportunities. Unfortunately, the new reality of our business required us to adapt our organizational structure moving forward. During the quarter, we took additional measures to further reduce costs, including the reduction of approximately 2,100 corporate roles globally and the extension of previously announced furloughs. These were very difficult decisions as our company’s culture has always been centered on supporting our team members who deliver hospitality for our guests. Through these challenging times, I am proud of how our team has continued to live our Hilton values to have integrity, to deliver exceptional guests experiences, and to be leaders in our industry and in our communities. We are working hard to restore confidence to travel again and have taken a number of measures to enhance the safety of our team members and guests. In June, we launched Hilton Clean Stay in collaboration with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic to provide industry leading hygiene practices in our properties all around the world. Our new elevated standards include modifying housekeeping procedures and adjusting common areas in our hotels to support social distancing. As part of the program, we also recently launched Hilton Event Ready, which sets new standards for cleanliness and customer service for meetings and events. Additionally, we are requiring everyone inside our hotels in the U.S. to wear face coverings in all indoor public spaces. Long before COVID-19, we had invested heavily in technology to give our Hilton Honors members access to seamless and contactless experiences with our Hilton Honors app. Today, our Honors members can benefit from features like digital check-in, room selection and the ability to message with hotel team members from their own device. Additionally, digital key allows for contactless check-in and check-out at the vast majority of our hotels globally. Combined with our new approaches to cleanliness, we think these are important initiatives on the road to reassuring guests of a safe experience at our hotels as travel resumes, while still delivering exceptional customer service. Turning to the quarter, as expected the pandemic and the related decreases in global travel and tourism materially affected our second quarter results. System-wide RevPAR declined 81% year-over-year with all regions and chain scales meaningfully impacted. Approximately, 20% of our system-wide properties had temporarily suspended operations at some point in the first half of the year. Today, nearly 80% of those hotels have reopened, including all of our hotels in China and the majority of our hotels in the United States. In Europe, we are seeing steady progress on re-openings as restrictions ease and demand gradually return. Today, more than 96% of our system-wide hotels are open and operating. In terms of demand, we are seeing meaningful improvements off the lows in April with monthly sequential increases throughout the quarter and into July. System-wide occupancy rebounded from a low of roughly 13% to approximately 45% currently, with all major regions improving. In Asia-Pacific, performance is largely driven by rebounds in both leisure and business transient travel in China, where occupancy is more than 60%. In the Americas, occupancy is over 45% boosted by increasing demand for limited service hotels and drive to leisure markets. During the 4th of July weekend, nearly 800 hotels in the U.S. ran over 80% occupancy. Across Europe, Middle East and Africa, occupancy is generally around 30%, although easing government restrictions and continued reopening should help drive further improvements there. As we look to the fall, assuming no significant disruptions to the current environment, we hope to see a continuation of the modest pickup in business transient demand, which would help offset slower leisure demand post-summer. However, we remain cautious given the uncertainty surrounding the virus and its overall impact, including the reopening of schools and offices. While we continue to adjust to new ways of interacting, one thing remains consistent, our focus on doing what is right for our guests and their evolving travel needs. For that reason, we made a number of changes very early on. We introduced and have since extended the most flexible cancellation policies in the industry and were among the first global hotel companies to implement rewards extensions to help Honors member maintain their points and status. Through our partnership with American Express, we also enhanced our co-branded credit cards to include more ways for Honors members to earn rewards during this time and provide cardholders with greater flexibility and even more points now to use for future travel. From a development perspective, activity was disrupted given the broader macro challenges yet, we were still able to add 7,000 rooms to our system and achieved 4.8% net unit growth versus the same period last year. Monthly openings increased sequentially throughout the quarter and in June, openings in the Americas were nearly 15% higher than last year. Additionally, we continue to be encouraged by conversion opportunities, which should help mitigate the impact of construction delays. For the full year, we expect net unit growth to be in the 3.5% to 4% range. It will take time for development to fully recover, but we are confident that we have the brands and the commercial engines to continue taking a disproportionate share of the global pipeline. In the quarter, we signed several notable luxury deals, including the Waldorf-Astoria Tokyo, the Conrad Costa del Sol in Spain, and the Oceana in Santa Monica which will join our LXR portfolio. On the conversion side, we saw positive momentum across our Doubletree, Curio and Tapestry brands. As an additional testament to the strength of our development strategy, during the quarter, we signed a management license agreement with Country Garden, one of the strongest players in the Chinese property market to exclusively develop Home2 Suites properties in China. We expect this partnership to produce more than 1,000 hotels over time and look forward to introducing a new brand and segment to the Chinese market. As one of Hilton’s fastest growing and award winning brands, we think Home2 is well-positioned to capture additional growth opportunities in the extended stay mid-scale segments in China. Taking the current landscape and uncertainties into considerations, we have a clear path forward. I am very proud of what we have been able to accomplish during these difficult times and I am confident that we will emerge stronger. I think we have demonstrated our flexibility, resiliency and an ability to embrace change, all while continuing to do what’s best for our people and the future of our business. With that, I am going to turn the call over to Kevin for a little bit more detail on the second quarter results.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter, as Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR declined 81% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis with decreases across all chain scales and regions. Decreases were largely driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from increased competition for lower rated business further impacting results. We did however see sequential improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in China and the U.S. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, declining 92% year-over-year. Results reflect the significant reduction in global travel demand due to COVID-19 and the subsequent temporary suspension of operations at more than 1,000 hotels at some point in the quarter. Revenue declines were mitigated by greater cost control at the corporate and property levels. Management franchise fees decreased 77% to $135 million driven by RevPAR declines and unfavorable timing of license fees. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to significant closures, fixed operating cost and fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Results were mitigated by cost control tactics across the portfolio. Diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.61. Turning to liquidity, we ended the quarter with total cash and equivalents of nearly $3.6 billion following a number of actions taken early in the quarter to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility. Additionally, our cash burn during the second quarter was lower than expected partially due to the timing of certain payments. As we look at the balance of the year, we remain confident that we have ample liquidity to continue to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Certainly. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, Chris. Kevin. Thank you for your comments.
Chris Nassetta: Hey, good morning, Carlo.
Carlo Santarelli: Good morning. Chris, you talked a little bit about obviously we have seen demand come off the low as we see that in this data and that you expect kind of a modest type of business transient demand somewhat offset a waning leisure as we move out of the summer vacation month. Bigger picture, as you think about the second half of this year, could you talk a little bit about how you foresee kind of the shape of the recovery in aggregate?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I’d be happy to. Obviously that is the big question. And I certainly have a view, although I think there is obviously still enough uncertainty out there, where we – it’s hard to be confident in the view, but my view really hasn’t changed, Carlo, a whole lot from the last call. And if I think about the shape of the recovery so far, which has gone from a low of basically a little over 10% and now running 45% and moving our way up to 50%. That’s – while those are still terrible numbers, that is a lot of improvement over a relatively short period of time. And if you go back to what I said on the last call, that’s sort of what we had expected. I mean, things are sort of moving fairly close to what we would have expected. I said on the last call and I’d sort of say the same thing, I think we are going – you are going to see a step change from very, very low levels as you start to reopen the world, where you are going to get to 40% to 50% occupancy levels by the end of the summer, early fall and then it’s going to be a grind up, because as you get through the health elements of this crisis, you are going to be dealing with an economic crisis or a recessionary environment and businesses and individuals have been impacted. And so, you are going to be on a grind up from there. And that’s sort of what I think is happening. I think as you go into the fall, what I would hope is that we are going to be in that 45% to 50% range. You are going to see leisure trail off as you always do, but I think a little less so, it will take a little longer for that to bleed off, because a lot of kids aren’t going back to school or that they are, but virtually a lot of offices aren’t opening up do you know and so their people are going to be virtual. So, they have a lot more flexibility to sort of extend the leisure travel season and we can already see early telltale signs of that, because it’s been very hard to get availability in certain locations in July and August. So, they are extending into September and maybe into October. So, I think you will have a little bit heavier leisure business as you go into the fall, which will be helpful, because that’s been significant part of the business. And you will I think continue to see some movement up in business transient. We saw it through the quarter. I mean, if you look at our managed – our managed business transient segment, which would typically be like last year in June was 20% of our business. In June of 2020, it was 18% of our business. Now, it’s a little bit different makeup of business traveler than probably it was last year for the last decade or two or three, but nonetheless, it was business-related travel. So, you are starting to see that come back not rapidly, but slowly. And I do think all things being equal as you get into the fall, you will see that continue. So, I think you are going to hopefully crossover with the pickup – with dropping off of leisure – a slight pickup in business and you are going to sort of hang out in that arena and be grinding slowly, but surely as we have been our way up even with the recurrence of COVID in a bunch of parts of the country. We stepped back for 2 or 3 weeks if you look at the data and then we started to march back and grind back up again. And that’s – the grind up again will depend on the trajectory of the overall recovery. I think my own view as I said it last time I think its 2 or 3 years to sort of get back to the demand levels that we were experiencing in ‘18 and ‘19. But I think it’s sort of – that is sort of the broader trajectory we will be in this hopefully 45%, 50% range and then moving our way steadily, slow and steady up from there. I do think there is a decent likelihood, I am not a health expert, but I am certainly talking to a lot of them. And folks in the government and the like on a daily basis, I do think there is a reasonably good chance that we will have not just a vaccine, but a sweet of different vaccines that get approved sometime in the fall. That will have different levels of effectiveness, but combined will be reasonably effective. And I think that’s going to help. Obviously that’s going to sort I think, help move us a little bit more rapidly through the health issues and then just into the economic issues. I do think if you get that you will see some step change in mobility and thus travel, particularly business travel just because that incremental person that is reticent to travel without it is going to have more confidence to do it. But I still think I stand by what I said, I think you could have – you could and will probably have a step change up on the occurrence of that. You will even without it continue grinding up and then we will take – it will take some time to get, because I don’t think we should be under any illusion that even with a vaccine, we are going to be back at ‘18 or ‘19 levels of business transient travel demand for a period of time just because the economic impact has been significant and it will workout – and over the next 2 or 3 years, but it will take.
Carlo Santarelli: Very helpful, Chris. Thank you very much for that. And then just if I could one follow-up the net unit growth obviously the 3.5% to 4%, down from what you said before, but in the current environment, certainly not bad. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what the components of that look like, what you are seeing in terms of conversion activity, how aggressive you have been able to be etcetera on that front?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, it’s obviously Carlo lower than what we thought of pre-COVID, it’s higher than what we thought last quarter. It’s moved up a tick. I think we said last quarter about midpoint of our guidance, which would be in the low-3s and now we are midpoint of our current guidance is in the high 3s. And I would probably, with what I see today, I would probably bet based on what we are seeing, it would be towards the higher end of that, if all goes well. I think conversions are going to play a role in it. They certainly will be. We have a lot of momentum there. In terms of the deals that we are signing and that are in active discussions, I think those are up circa 50%, from where they were last year in conversions. Some of that will translate into this year and a lot of it – a lot more of it will translate into next year. So, I think a larger component of the dug will be conversions. But it’s – the latest data that I am seeing is probably 5 points, 4, 5, 6 points, I think it will be significantly more than that next year, just because the world sort of while conversions are obviously sort of in keeping with what’s going on in the broader environment. We went through a period of time of 3 or 4 months where sort of nothing was getting done. Now, we are in lots of active discussions. Those deals need to be negotiated. In some cases, you need to do CapEx work, property improvement programs and get it into the system. And so some of that – a bunch of that’s going to happen this year. As I said, we will have we will have meaningful incremental percentage this year, but I think a lot more just time wise by the time things get done, we will be into next year. And I do think the combination of that with the properties that were new construction that got delayed, because of the freezing of time during particularly most of the second quarter will mean next year will be a better NUG year. I don’t think it will be back to where we were yet. I think it will take a couple of years to get back to where we were. But I just think the math, the math of how NUG is going to work is going to – is going to – it does strongly suggest that our 3.5% to 4% is sort of the low point in this cycle and then next year is better and then we are – then we are moving our way back to a more stabilized environment. I mean, what’s interesting, you didn’t ask it, but somebody will, we are still – there are few months that everybody is frozen, we are still signing a lot of deals and getting a lot of deals under construction. I mean, I wouldn’t hold me to it, because data is not perfect these days, in the sense that it’s hard to – hard to know exactly what people are going to do, but best – our best guess is that we will probably sign – our signings maybe down circa 20%. Our starts right now look like they are down circa 10% and then we already talked about NUG. So that’s why the pipeline numbers are looking good as we are still signing lots of deals that we are eventually going to open and we are not opening them as fast. So the math becomes pretty, pretty simple to explain there. So, we are – I have been surprised honestly to the good on activity on the development side on all fronts. I have been surprised on how many deals were getting signed. I have been surprised to the good on how many are going under construction. And as I said, our NUG numbers are sort of inching up, which is a pleasant surprise. So, we are still – we are still working hard in the Country Garden deal, I think is a testament to the fact that like we are not crying in our milk. We got a business to run. We got great brands. This too shall pass. We will get back to a more normalized environment and we got to be forward – we people we have to deal with the current environment which I think we have quite well, but we also have to look forward, I think Country Garden, which was – which we are working on pre-COVID obviously if it got done is a testament to the fact that we are dealing with it here now and we are also dealing with the future all at the same time, which is what we get paid to do.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, Chris. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: Hey, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, Chris. So, just wanted to maybe follow-up, I mean obviously some very difficult decisions were made in the quarter as it relates to kind of the broader corporate cost structure and operating structure for Hilton here. How can you help us think about, what happens as trend lines continue to improve and what parts of this – are these reductions need to come back, because these were really volume driven pieces of business versus how much of this kind of go forward you can’t actually rethink or possibly be a little bit more efficient going forward. Just any thoughts or color on that?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Hey, Shaun, it’s Kevin, I will take this one. I’d say look, obviously it’s going to be a combination of both of those things, right. We do have – we do have parts of our business. That’s obviously a very complicated business. There are parts that are sort of purely volume and there are parts where it’s not as much volume and we can be more efficient. I’d say the way to think about it is for our corporate costs, for our corporate G&A, we gave you guidance last time that will be down around 25% to 30%. We are coming in right along those lines, most of the moves that we ended up making were largely thought through when we gave that guidance if not final decisions had been made, but it was certainly factored into our guidance. I’d say, in that part of the business, the way to think about it is most of the cost will be sustained – cost savings will be sustainable. There will be some elements of furloughs and salary reductions that obviously won’t repeat themselves and created touch of a headwind. And then of course that’s offset by the fact that the reductions in force then get annualized going forward, which will be largely permanent savings. And so as the business comes back, some level of inflationary type expense growth, you should expect to come back, but I would say for some period of time, it should be quite sustainable.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: And the next question will be from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.
Joe Greff: Good morning, Chris. Good morning, Kevin.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Kevin Jacobs: Hey, Joe.
Joe Greff: You mentioned and referred to the nice occupancy gains where the portfolio is in that 45% to 50% range, I think you referenced to 50% in one of the answers to the questions. I was hoping maybe you can frame it, maybe you said it and I missed it, but how – how are you doing or tracking from a rate perspective? Maybe you can kind of put it into perspective of 3Q to-date July RevPAR trends and kind of benchmark that against the industry data domestically and globally? And then I have a follow-up.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I would say, our performance weighted for the industry is maybe a touch better when you adjust for the difference in methodology, which is that we are keeping all of our hotels, even the hotels that closed temporarily or are still closed in our comp set. If you – and star is not if you adjust for that and we are on top of – or a little bit better. I would say on the rate side of things, we have seen improvement basically for the quarter, at the beginning of the quarter, rate was down, of that like, April was almost 90% down in RevPAR, about 35% down in rate. If you look at July, that’s 25% down. And if you look at where the trend line is going in August and beyond, it’s coming down. I mean, I think the rate thing is a really – we have had a lot of discussion about it here, because lots of questions on is the industry going to maintain rate integrity and all that. I think, what is really behind the rate issue as we dig into the data and it doesn’t take much digging, because there is not that much data these days or not as much as normal. It’s really a mix issue, which is we have – the traditional customer of ours particularly has been a higher rated leisure and a higher rated business traveler. There is just not as many of them at the moment traveling for all the reasons that you guys know. And so it’s a different sort of population, not entirely, but largely different than we are used to, which is much more not to be judgmental, but a much lower and lower price point customer and so the issue for all of us in the industry, I can’t speak for what others have done that speak for us is we have owners that are really hurting and we are trying to do everything we can to help them, because no business is built for sort of what was happening, which is like the limited or no revenue and then very, very low levels of revenue and so in this very difficult time, along with our consultation with our owners, our view was, whatever business is out there to help them we need to go after it. And so what’s happened is race have come down largely as a result, I’m not going to say there isn’t great pressure broadly in an environment like this, everybody expects a bargain. So yes, there is rate pressure broadly, but if you look at the data, if you look at the math, the bulk of it is just mix We are now in this environment we have gone after directly some through the OTAs, but largely through our own through our own channels with honors, and all of our marketing campaigns and marketing spend, lower funnel has been going after that lower rated leisure traveler because it has been the bulk of what is out there to get and we need to we need to help our owners get to the other side of this. And so when you when you mix that in, it’s just added, it starts even pre COVID at a much lower price point. And I think so I think that is what’s going on with ADR. I think while there’ll be pressure on ADR because of the economic issues that have been caused, as a result of COVID, and it would be silly to say there won’t be I think you will get, I think that the pressures that you saw in the second quarter that are still ongoing, when you get back to the new level of what I will call a new normalized environment, where you have many more of our traditional travelers, higher end leisure and higher end business transients, travelers on the road again, I think this will, will write itself in quite rapidly.
Joe Greff: Great. And one of the answers is a nice segue to my follow up question. Based on what we were able to ascertain from the release, it doesn’t seem that any kind of third party collections issues with a significant working capital or free cash flow drag in the 2Q one is our premise. They are correct. And then two, has there been any trend change in the 3Q and would you anticipate them? Maybe first more broadly, that if there are issues, there would be some sort of lag or how do you view that? And that’s it for me. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks. Joe. I would say look, what I would say generally on the collections and broadly working capital side is, obviously relative to the guidance we gave you last quarter things generally went better than we thought and I would say that is across the board on terms of in terms of the buckets of, in the managed portfolio and in terms of payment of fees and the like. We are we do in this in this environment. We have built some receivables we are sort of collecting at a slower pace than normal which is completely understandable given what is going on in the world and given what our owners are going through But I would say again, largely better than we thought, sort of obviously, everything that’s happened was captured in the numbers nothing is really changed so far in the third quarter, although we should point out that it’s still early in the third quarter, and there is a lot of year left, but so, so far, it’s, been going quite well.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks. I am going to follow-up on that last question on working capital and also tying in reimbursed costs how should investors think about how these will trend in a more sustained recovery? I mean, do you just get back to break even or could you actually get incremental revenue or income in from those relative to the expenses?
Kevin Jacobs: Well, revenue doesn’t get re-collections doesn’t affect the way we recognize revenue. And so I think you could see in you could see on The P&L that, in the in the funded part of the business or the reimbursable part of the business, we did spend more than we then we earned in this quarter, which is completely normal. if you think about what is going on in the world, and how quickly revenues decline anything from a cash basis, we would expect to get the vast majority of it will be repaid. And so you should think about there will be a flip around on the cash side that did doesn’t necessarily correspond with what you’re seeing on the P&L on the revenue side.
Stephen Grambling: Got it. And then you also referenced on the distribution side a little bit on the OTAs here. I guess prior to COVID. I think there was a heavy direct booking campaign and there was maybe some hope that consumer preferences may change, such that in a downturn, you might start to see less focus or less emphasis on the OTAs given the current environment, I guess in some ways you think would argue for more inventory going to the OTAs are you seeing that change in behavior or there is any other data points that you can provide that might glean some insight there?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, it’s a good question. And I think I sort of touched on it, indirectly. Yes, in this environment, you just heard what I said about the biggest bucket of demand, which is lower price leisure demand that would typically favor OTAs. That is typically what we have used over time, the OTAs for to supplement the other pools of our demand that we have very direct access to. And so you would think this would mean that our distribution channel mix would be shifting in that way, but reality is it has not. Our direct channels in part because of what we have been doing, because we do want to continue to build direct relationships with customers of all sorts, including these customers who we hope may not have been our typical customer before, but we hope we will adopt our system during COVID and post-COVID and we will add to the complement of customers that we have. And so, the OTA business from a distribution point of view has held relatively constant. Our direct channels are growing at a faster pace. And that is, as I said – that is because of our actions, not so much and what we are doing and with the SAs, but very much how we are spending our marketing dollars and how we are orienting our Honors programs to access that type of customer.
Stephen Grambling: Make sense. Thank you so much. Best of luck in the back half from and to the west.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Hi, good morning. So you guys have obviously had a long experience operating hotels and so on some hotels in the past have a lot of hotels. Kevin, this big picture, how are you thinking of the overall hotel operating cost structure will change in the future versus pre-COVID levels? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Hi, Tom, it’s a really good question and I would say that deserves a good answer as always. I will give you an answer. I am not in a position at the moment yet to be highly specific, but I will certainly answer it directionally. And the fact of the matter is we are spending probably more time on that right now inside our organization than any other single thing that we are doing. For all the reasons you would guess, I mean, in the early stages of COVID and continuing our effort with our owners, because we need to help them bridge this very difficult time had been to provide a tremendous amount of flexibility against our standards of all sorts, in terms of food and beverage standards, operating of across the board and reality is doing a lot of work with our customer base. That’s what they expected. Everybody knows we are in a different world and the things are going to be different. We will get back to a more normalized world, but we want to use this opportunity to really dive very deeply into each and every brand which we are doing both the CapEx and OpEx standards to see if we can’t drive far greater efficiency. Now, the trick is and the needles that we are not just trying, but we will thread is we have the best brands in the business and those brands have the highest premiums in the industry. In COVID world, it’s like anarchy across the world, but we are going to get out of that in the not too distant future and these brands will continue to have the premiums, but the reality is, like any business over time in any industry, you add things, you add things you are – I would argue, we all have been better at adding things and taking things away. And so what we are doing in a simple way working very closely with customers is figuring out what are the things that are most important to driving those premiums and what are the things that don’t matter and it’s the things that don’t matter, or they were from yesteryear and they might have helped, 10 years ago, but they don’t matter as much today, then we don’t need to be doing those things. And then looking just at the engineering, particularly in the limited service space of every single element of the hotel, like food and beverage, to the penny on cost per occupied room and the like and so I am – I am not just optimistic, I will say we are going to find for our ownership community significant savings at the same time, I believe finding a way to make these brands even better and even more relevant to customers, because we will lean in heavier to the things that matter and get it and get out of the things that does not matter so I know in the end, you guys like to translate everything to a model and would like to, would like to build a model for the ownership community. What that means I can’t tell you because we are race, we are literally deep in the middle of it. And we have got a very large group of our most important and knowledgeable owners that are at the table with us we have, we are in constant communication with a broad array, representing our customer base. And I think it’s really exciting work that, if you would have to take an ‘18 or ‘19 sort of normalized demand level, we will clearly be driving in every one of our brands, higher margins, just because we are going to necessity I used this I have said this too many times in my career, which bums me out but necessity becomes the mother of invention. Well, I think our brands our brands are the best and drove great margins and we got disproportionate share of pipeline because our brands performed better top line and bottom line than our competitors. That’s not good enough. We, right now our owners are suffering, it’s going to be, a long dig out and we know we can create greater efficiencies and at the same time, not in any way threatened, but enhance our premiums.
Thomas Allen: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. I wonder if you could give us a little color on the conversations that you are having with your corporate customers. I don’t know if this is a little too early for when you would normally have corporate pre negotiated rates, discussions, but are our corporate buyers just sort of saying, Hey, we don’t even need have this conversation call me in six months I guess if you could give us a little insight into what your big buyers of business travel historically are saying?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, it is a little early, Robin, but it’s a really good question. And I would ask it to, with I think next quarter, we will have a heck of a lot more to say, because we will have had a lot more conversation, I would say. And I am going to, I’m going to put it into the three big buckets, okay, I think a third, a third, a third. And this is I am being more scientific than reality but sort of in my own head, that’s how plays out a third of our, of our big corporate customers are super understanding of what’s going on. And they are of the belief that whatever deal we had to just continue on, and, and there’s want to be supportive in this environment. They probably, for a period of time, we are going to be traveling less, but they want to sort of continue on with the basic pricing parameters that they had, and they’ve signed up for that, I would say and again, I we are just more early in the season of this dialogue. So it could change, I would say a third of them don’t know, okay, there’s sort of like, gosh, I don’t know what to do. This is a crazy world, I sort of hear what you are saying, maybe we should just keep going. But there is sort of contemplative, and then a third are saying, it’s a really crazy world and, and we want we got to get a better deal. Okay, that’s, we are suffering. If we are going to travel and we are going to stay with you we got to get a better deal. And I would say that’s as much as I know, at the moment, I think in the end, that third that are in the middle, I think half of them go both ways. I think it’s sort of 50-50 when I talked to our sales teams, and it’s all anecdotal for the record, it’s not like this is scientific data, but I’m talking to them all the time. every single week, at least once, they will say it’s or like half of our big corporate customers get it, they want to be supportive, they that they are not going to beat us up in half are sort of like, nah, I, got to get a better deal because the world my world blew up too. So we will see how it plays out. As I said there will be an environment where you get through the health situation and you are in a economic downturn, there is going to be as there always is some pressures on rate people are going to expect a bargain for everything, most things that they are doing. I my own belief is that will not be intense pressure, certainly not reflective of what you are seeing in the current environment. As I said to an earlier question, much of the rate degradation, the bulk of the rate degradation, as far as I can tell at this point, is really just the mix. It’s just a different customer base. There will be pressure, but not this kind of pressure on rates as you get to a more normalized environment.
Robin Farley: That’s great. Thank you. And maybe just as my follow-up still thinking about sort of intentions of travelers, can you give color on for group bookings? Obviously, I am sure things like we hear from others are canceling through Q1, but our new group bookings coming in for next year are not really, is there a pause even people?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, they are. Intentions keep picking up. I mean, you’re right, I think all of – like what we are seeing broadly is, you know, a lot of it, we are doing some group by the way, in the second quarter, we did like 10% of our volume was group. I think it will be higher in the third and fourth quarter for what it’s worth. So – but again, it’s not our typical groups, it’s like – it’s groups related to the crisis, it’s businesses in small group meetings where they just have to do it, but their offices aren’t really open yet. I mean, they are – and we are getting a lot of that kind of stuff. But I mean, it’s obviously a small fraction of what it typically would be. I do think it will keep picking up, because those sort of other types of groups are going to keep picking up as the year goes on, but the traditional bigger group meetings and all that, that are kind of a bread and butter in the fall, those are going to keep getting kicked out. A bunch of them are still on the books for the rest of year, but I think a lot of that will wash out. And as day by day you sort of see that washing out and people are kicking the can into next year with again the hopes that the health crisis be low will pass and/or through a vaccine, herd immunity, whatever is going to happen. And the further we go in the year the further they sort of kick it out, because there is a lot of noise in the system and it makes them nervous about wanting to spend a lot of time and money planning a meeting, they might have to – they might have to cancel. So, I would say, where it starts to stiffen up a bit is – starting in Q2 of next year. I think people – the psychology of it is for third and fourth quarter you will see groups, but it’s sort of group meetings at a necessity or a replacement for something what happened into your office and that will pickup as time goes on. But the core sort of traditional group business is going to kick forward to Q2 through Q4 next year and we are both moving business that is cancelling, we are moving every bit we can and which is most of it to a future date. And we are booking new business. I mean, they are – we are booking tens of millions of dollars a week of new business for periods in the future, most of which is starting in the second quarter next year. So, a lot of it will – again, you get – it’s like there is so many unknowns. You get a vaccine it changes the game on a lot of these things. Again, you still have the economic situation to deal with and people have still been damaged in that way. But I think it frees up a lot – it creates a decent amount of momentum, because the fear goes away. So I think we just have to see where all this – see where all of this goes through the fall. I mean, again, I feel pretty good about where things are going with vaccines. There certainly is a lot of data out there that says as you get to the later part of this year and early next, even if you don’t have a vaccine, you are going to be at a point of herd immunity, because enough people are either naturally have the natural antibodies, T-cells and/or have been exposed in a way where it just can’t spread the same way that it has. Again, I am not a health expert like you I read a lot of stuff. I think we just have to sort of get watch it really carefully in the fall. And on the current course, I think all segments will continue to grind up. Group will obviously be the longest last, because people require spending, planning and right now, most people don’t want to do that. Alright, they just – they don’t want to do that, because they are afraid they are wasting time and money.
Robin Farley: Does that mean actually that what you have on the books for second half of next year is actually kind of ahead of what it would normally be, in other words versus the same time last year for?
Chris Nassetta: No, I don’t have the data in front of me, but no, I don’t think that’s the case. And it’s not yet. I think it could – it could eventually build to that. And if things go well, it will, I think, but not at the moment, no, we are not where we were.
Robin Farley: Thank you. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Richard Clarke with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Richard Clarke: Good morning. Thanks very much. One of your competitors said a couple of days agothey are expecting business travel to be to see a behavioral change and about a 10% behavioral change. Am I right in thinking you don’t adhere to that? And I guess their point was they would have to make up for that with alternative revenue sources, whether that’s skewing more towards leisure or using the hotels in a slightly different way and is that something also you’re looking to contemplate going forward?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I think that I didn’t mean to ply anything on that, as far as I was concerned. And so if I if I did, what I meant, but in answer to that question, I would say, I mean, there’s, that there is a raging debate about that, but I think will be ongoing over the next 3 years. My belief is from having done this for 37 years and while we have not had a pandemic like this, we have had lots of other things, lots of other similar things that have disrupted the environment that, in the short intermediate term, you are definitely going to have a substitution effect because people businesses have been damaged. And as a result, they are going to have to have find ways to cut costs and save money and so they are going to substitute zoom in for certain types of meetings, and it will they will have an impact in the short intermediate term. I think over the long term, there will be and by the way, as a result, we of course are looking as we are now at every opportunity of how we utilize our all of our rooms and all our public spaces and everything else in creative ways to be able to supplement and find different pockets of demand, whether that be leisure, whether that be using rooms as offices in an environment where people aren’t, opening offices because we have a safe environment where people can be socially distanced by definition, etcetera. We are doing all those things. I personally believe when you wake up in two or three years, and you can, you can, we will all mark this moment and let’s talk in three years, I think we will have a raging debate this business travel will never be the same. And it will look, it may look like that, because businesses have been hobbled a lot of them and it will be lower for a while, I have already said, I think it takes two or three years to get back. I think what we will find when we wake up in three years, it’ll be more like it was in 18 and 19, than it is now. There will be a substitution effect. There will be different. There will be certain types of business travel that probably forever will change whoever said 10%, God bless them. I am not smart enough to figure that out. I have read a bunch of pundits have had views, I don’t know. But at the same time, like every other time, there will be other things and other needs for travel that will emerge. And so I think while it will take a few years to get back, I think, one way or another we will have similar levels of demand, both for business transients and group people will want to congregate people will have to meet will have to build relationships, if anything that zoom in WebEx, I think has taught us it’s really hard, to build a real relationship this way. So, maybe a bunch of internal meetings or whatever, there are some things I mean, that’s all we are doing. There is some things that I think will be what percentage and I know will sort of become a more permanent way of doing things, but they will be they will be supplanted by other forms of travel where people are going to are going to be out traveling for things that that they haven’t been traveling for. And so, short intermediate term, we absolutely have scrambled every jet we got to think about a weaker business transients demand environments to fill those gaps. We and I believe longer term it will recover to similar level.
Richard Clarke: If I can just ask a quick follow up, obviously, on your franchise agreements the fee structure is heavily skewed towards room revenue. Is there a need to sort of reopen franchise agreement to make sure that you are aligned with the hotels to drive all these alternative sources of revenue as well?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I don’t think so. I mean, the reality is in a big full service hotel, our revenue – our fees are generally based on both food and beverage and rooms and other revenues. So in the big complex hotels that already – we already do that in a limited service hotel, let’s be honest, there is pretty much only rooms. So we don’t have a lot of other infrastructure or capacity in the facility in most limited service, like a Hampton Inn, there isn’t a lot of meeting space. By the way, that’s part of room revenue in any event. There is a – it’s a small lobby. It’s a different animal. And so there really is rooms, it’s in those hotels if you are – if you don’t have your traditional customers it’s what other ways can you sell rooms. Like I said, you could sell them as office space, you can do, there are things that you sell them as dormitories, which we are doing like crazy, right. We have done dozens and dozens of deals across the country with universities. We are doing all those things, but that – but all that flows through room revenues and I think the incentives are properly aligned already generally.
Richard Clarke: Great. Thanks very much.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hey, thanks. I just wanted to ask you kind of going back to your pipeline, when you talk with your developers, what are they seeing or telling you in terms of how banks are thinking about financing new construction at this point? And maybe kind of if you could talk about it relative to kind of franchise limited service properties and then maybe anything you are seeing on the full service side?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think it’s a good question, Smedes. I think it’s a little early, I would say what people are saying everybody is being mean, look we are in the middle of a global pandemic, right. So I think everybody is being a touch more conservative about everything. I mean, that’s why you sort of see, you hear Chris talking about us pivoting, towards conversions and the like. I would say, generally speaking, though projects that make sense can still get financed, there is a ton of capital on the world. Rates are low, if people are willing to equitize, if they have the equity – if they are willing to equitize a little bit more, they can get deals done and they and their lenders can collectively – can collaboratively look towards the future and say hey, look, we are going to open this thing up into - -hopefully open this thing up into a new cycle. And so generally people are still working on that stuff. And then as it relates to the mix, what we were already seeing was much more demand in the smaller limited service type hotels, the bigger more complicated full service hotels largely didn’t get built a lot this cycle, because the recovery never justified them building costs kept going up, labor costs kept going up. And so they really weren’t all that active in terms of construction anyway. So that’s really not, that precise of an answer I think, because it is a little early, but you should assume a little bit more conservatism across the board.
Smedes Rose: Thanks. And then Chris, can I just follow-up with you. You talked a little bit about the operating model, that question came up earlier. Just one thing that’s come up with owners is the idea of suspending housekeeping during a guest stay and making that just kind of a permanent part of the hotel operating business. Do you think that’s really on the table and does that meaningfully change the margin from an owner’s perspective kind of all else equal?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, we are right in the middle of that, Smedes. So, I don’t really have an answer. Everything is on the table, first of all. I mean, we are – it’s that along with literally hundreds of other things around the table. That’s probably one of the bigger things. We have agreed already with our owners in the short to intermediate term to do that as part of our launch of clean stay, because we think it is a better protocol for cleanliness to not have third-parties in the room. And so we clean the room. We seal – literally put a seal on the door. And only if a customer requests it, so it’s an opt in, do we have somebody come in and do a limited cleaning that obviously based on the fact that people have been not opting in at a high rate, that is helpful from a margin point of view. We also think it’s helpful from a cleanliness point of view, which is why it was part of clean stay. What we are doing is using this moment, which at a minimum that will go through this year to figure out with our customers what they really want. I mean, what we are trying to do is thread the needle with our customer and our owner community to make sure that, what I said in my earlier comment that we are ultimately giving our customers what they want, so they will pay a big premium for our product. And we are doing in a way that drives the best margins humanly possible for our owners. And we have to satisfy both constituencies. And so what we are doing between now and the end of the year is looking at a lot of data, we are doing it, so we now have a real test that is system-wide that is live, that is allowing us to look at data to see the behavior of the consumer to talk to consumers about their views on this. And so it’s definitely on the table, but we don’t yet have enough data to have an answer and I think the idea is that we will through the rest of this year, be studying it and figure out based on that data what the right answer is.
Smedes Rose: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time. Obviously, Q2, not a shining moment in our 100-year history, but I guess this is what happens when you have a global pandemic we found out. I have lived through a lots of different things over the years and this is certainly – has stressed the limits of I think what all of us have seen. But I am really, as I said in my comments, I am very proud of how we have responded. I mean, we have taken a difficult situation I think and are managing our way through it quite well. Our team has been working tirelessly, fewer of them working even harder. And I feel as good as I did pre-COVID about the long-term prospects for this business, it may not feel that way to you all right now, but I do think when we wake up in 2 or 3 years, we will be back on track and this business will be performing as will the industry quite well. We look forward to talking to you after Q3. Every quarter, we learn a lot. So I suspect we will have a little bit better visibility into the trajectory of recovery, maybe even have some knowledge on vaccines as all of us etcetera. So we will look forward to catching you up after Q3. Take care and be well.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-05-07 11:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today’s prepared remarks, there will a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note today’s event is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Jill Slattery, Vice President Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Jaime. Welcome to Hilton’s first quarter 2020 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K supplemented by our Form 8-K filed on April 16, 2020. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call, in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment; Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our first quarter results. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think we can all agree and certainly probably have all been saying a lot lately, these are truly unprecedented times. COVID-19 has created challenges that our industry has never encountered before. On behalf of Hilton's entire leadership team, I'd like to express our deepest sympathies to those who have lost loved ones during this devastating pandemic. I'd also like to extend our sincere gratitude to the millions of workers on the frontlines across many industries and in many roles, working selflessly to help keep us all safe. I also want to thank our team members around the world for their remarkable dedication, hard work and sacrifice. Many of our own team members have been personally impacted by this crisis and yet, through this adversity, they've continued to spread the light and warmth of hospitality. Across every region, we've adapted quickly to provide hospitality in new ways in our communities.  In London, several of our properties are hosting the National Health Service and other key workers. The Hilton Orlando has been hosting the National Guard and working to distribute essential items to community residents in need and over 500 hotels around the world are being used for recovery efforts. Our properties have also donated thousands of pounds of food and supplies to local food banks. Through the Hilton Effect Foundation, we are providing disaster response grants for organizations and communities fighting the spread of COVID-19. As part of this effort, our Hilton Honors members have donated more than 6.5 million points to these causes.  In partnership with American Express and our ownership community, we committed to donating up to 1 million room nights to frontline medical professionals in the United States to support those who are putting their lives on the line to protect us. Since its launch just four weeks ago, tens of thousands medical professionals have booked hundreds of thousands of rooms through the program. Further building on this initiative, just this week, we and American Express announced a partnership with World Central Kitchen to deliver freshly prepared meals at no charge from restaurants and local communities to frontline responders staying at our hotels. Already active in three major markets, there are plans to expand this initiative in the coming weeks.  Turning to the business, to ensure we effectively navigate this challenging time, we've focused our priorities on three core areas: protect our people; protect our core business; and prepare for recovery. While our long-term goal remains the same to drive loyalty across all of our stakeholders, the current situation requires greater levels of responsiveness and preparedness in the near term. With this in mind, we've worked closely with industry association and the administration to advocate on behalf of our team members and hotel owners, and to help shape the broader recovery. Given our leadership team’s extensive crisis management experience, coupled with the global nature of our business, we had a relatively early glimpse of the impact this pandemic started to have in the Asia Pacific region. In response, we took swift action to protect our business and ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to operate in these unprecedented times.  With travel demand at record lows, we currently have suspended operations at approximately 950 or 16% of our hotels globally, including approximately 10% of our hotels in the Americas, 60% of our hotels in Europe, the Middle East in Africa, and 15% of our hotels in Asia Pacific. At the hotel level, we acted quickly at the beginning of the crisis, to make decisions to help our owners respond, including suspending hotel operations, temporarily suspending brand and operating standards, deferring capital expenditure requirements, eliminating quality assurance audits and allowing the use of FF&E reserves for operating expenses. Going forward, we are working closely with our ownership community to define the hotel operating model of the future with a goal of developing operating standards that will keep our customers safe and drive enhanced efficiency and profitability, while continuing to deliver products and service that customers will pay a premium for. At the corporate level, we've reduced executive salaries, furloughed nearly two-thirds of our corporate workforce, eliminated other non-essential expenses, including capital expenditures and suspended share buybacks and dividends. Further, as a precautionary measure to preserve financial flexibility, we drew down on the remaining amount under our credit facility, pre-sold Hilton Honors points to American Express and successfully executed a bond offering, all of which resulted in a pro forma cash position of $3.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which we believe has more than adequate liquidity to get us through the crisis. Turning to the quarter RevPAR declined 23% with performance through February, largely in line with our expectations excluding the Asia Pacific region. RevPAR in March dropped 57%, as the virus spread across Europe and the U.S. Overall, we do not think our first quarter results provide clear insight into the current environment, as the timing of the pandemic and we -- given the timing of the pandemic and we expect a much more dramatic impact on our second quarter results. With travel at a virtual standstill, we expect system-wide RevPAR declined roughly 90% in April.  With that being said, we are starting to see glimmers of travel resuming and economies reopening. In China, nearly all 150 hotels that have been closed due to the pandemic have since reopened with occupancies reaching more than 50% during the May Day holiday this past weekend, up significantly from 9% in early February. Additionally, the majority of our previously halted construction projects in China have restarted. In the U.S. and Europe, we're starting to see sensible and staged re-openings of economies. We think temporary hotel suspensions have plateaued and we are now seeing reopening requests. Our sales teams are engaged with customers on business for the back half of the year and into 2021 and beyond. In the last week alone, we booked tens of billions of dollars in Group business in the Americas.  In addition, we are starting to see double-digit increases in digital traffic and booking activity across all segments. Global occupancy levels have gone from a low point of 13% to 23% currently. Assuming we start to see mobility and we don't have a significant recurrence, demand should slowly rebuild in the third quarter. These green shoots allow us to keep our eye on what the future of hospitality may look like. As we carefully consider what travelers needs will be in a post-COVID-19 world, we are proud to announce a partnership with Lysol and the Mayo Clinic last week to introduce Hilton CleanStay, a new program that will deliver an industry-defining standard of cleanliness at all of our properties around the world. We believe this program is the first of many steps we can take to build on the trust and loyalty of our more than 106 million Hilton Honors members as they begin to travel again. A full recovery will take time, and it could take several years to return to the hotel demand levels we experienced in 2019. But as we shift our focus to the future, we are incredibly confident about the long-term prospects of the business and our model. Our industry leading brands, powerful commercial engines, and innovative technology platforms should enable us to continue delivering incremental value to guests, owners and shareholders for years to come.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for details on the first quarter.
Kevin Jacobs : Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter system-wide RevPAR declined 23% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency neutral basis. RevPAR was down across all regions with the weakest results in Asia Pacific. Decreases were primarily driven by occupancy declines with rate pressure from the lower rated business further impacting results. Adjusted EBITDA was $363 million in the first quarter declining 27% year-over-year. Results reflect significant reductions in travel demand and the temporary suspension of operations in a number of hotels across the world. While the decline was somewhat mitigated by greater cost control, more significant measures were largely implemented after quarter end. Management and franchise fees decreased 18% to $422 million driven by RevPAR declines and roughly flat license fees.  Given the extremely challenging operating environment, which included the suspension of operations at 35 of our leased hotels during the quarter, our ownership segment posted a loss due to higher levels of operating leverage and fixed rent structures at some of our leased properties.  Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.74. During the quarter, we opened nearly 9,000 rooms meaningfully lower than prior expectations due to postponed openings driven by COVID-19. Approvals and construction starts increased ahead of our expectations, largely due to the signing of our largest development deal to-date, and agreement with Resorts World for a 3500 room tri-branded hotel resort on the Las Vegas Strip. Much like the rest of our business, development activity for the balance of the year will depend on a number of factors. However, we do expect that our ultimate rate of net unit growth for the year will be significantly lower than our pre-crisis expectations, likely around half the rate or a bit better.  Turning to liquidity, as Chris mentioned earlier, we've taken a number of actions to enhance our position and increase our financial flexibility, including executing on the bond transaction that Chris referenced earlier. We were very pleased with the outcome of that transaction through which we issued two $500 million tranches of senior notes at pricing that was very attractive relative to other transactions executed in the same timeframe. At the time, it also marked the first eight year high yield financing done since the crisis, which allowed us to continue to enhance our maturity schedule. We continue to have no debt maturities prior to 2024 and a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. Factoring for the senior note issuance as well as the $1 billion Hilton Honors points presale, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion on a pro forma basis, which we think should provide us with ample liquidity to navigate the current environment and prepare for recovery. Further details on our first quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Jamie, can we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Joe Greff from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Greff: I was hoping to get a better understanding of your operating sensitivities in this environment. And as we kind of look at these -- unbelievable to me to be talking about the magnitude of these RevPAR declines. But given these pretty steep RevPAR declines, how do you see the relationship to base and franchise fees? How do you see that relationship, which I can guess on the incentive management fee side? How are you thinking about your run rate G&A from here? And if you can give us some sort of -- some points on understanding the components of your monthly cash burn, I think that would be helpful to us?
Chris Nassetta: Wow! That's about 20 questions in there, Joe. Good job.
Joe Greff: Don't ask me to repeat it. I can't remember all of the questions.
Chris Nassetta: I can't either. Yes. We can't, as we said, we're not giving guidance. So we'll answer what we can but happy to talk about the sensitivities at a high level. I would say, as we look at the, what I think would be helpful sort of RevPAR to EBITDA relationship, the way I would think about it in terms of sensitivities and there's thousands of assumptions as you would guess that go into this is, if you have RevPAR declines -- and we're not giving guidance, so we're not going to suggest what we think they are for the year and you guys have views, I would say the model is such that up to around 30% RevPAR declines, the whole company RevPAR to EBITDA is a bit better than 1-to-1 and when it goes over 30%, it's a bit worse than 1-to-1 but not materially so. The base fee business throughout that continuum is better than 1-to-1 and what obviously hurts as the higher you go is a certain level of negative operating leverage because no matter how much you cut corporate costs, which we've done a lot of, there's a limit to how far you can go and keep the system going. And then in real estate, the lower the RevPAR is given that these are leased assets with some degree of fixed rent structure, that creates a tailwind. But again, that's a very small part of the business overall and has been. So, it keeps us even -- I've seen the industry sort of numbers I've seen from a bunch of folks I think including you are sort of minus 50 for the year, sort of funny to hear myself say that. But if you're doing this for 35 plus years, that's what the industry thinks. I think, as I said, our ratio, EBITDA -- overall ratio would be a little bit -- a touch above 1-to-1. The base fee business would be better even at those levels. On G&A -- on sort of the G&A as we see it on a GAAP basis, I think given the mitigation that we have done with an assumption that as you get into the third and fourth quarter, you will have some sort of -- you will start to see recovery. I mean, the truth is, while it's slow, we're starting to see it now. We've gone from 13% to 23% already, not a lot to be thankful for, but we do believe once you get through the epicenter of the crisis, which it feels like from a health point of view, we are. And you get into reopening parts of the world that haven't reopened, including United States, you'll start to improve in the third and in fourth quarter. I think when you net all that out, probably G&A is 25% to 30% lower. Remembering for us, and it's a point worth making, our G&A for the last three years has basically been flat. We are we believe always very disciplined about our G&A. And coming into the year we were actually guiding before pre-COVID-19 to a modest decline in G&A. Obviously, that decline, given the mitigation that that we have gone through to sort of right size the business for the operating environment will be much greater than what we would have suggested pre-COVID-19, but sort of in the ranges that I talked about.  On cash burn, and we have already as part of the bond deal and otherwise put out public information on that, I think the way to think about it is in the environment, we're sort of in the second quarter, which I said, I don't believe we will maintain that level of performance, and I think the third quarter will be the worst of it, even at those levels that are sort of circa 80% to 90% off. We think we have at least 24 months of liquidity. And if you take sort of industry, the industry view that I'm seeing broadly that I discussed earlier, actually, is that at that level of performance, we are better than cash flow positive. So, that hopefully gives you sort of a bit of a range, again recognizing we're not giving specific guidance but just trying to give you a general trajectory. Kevin, what did I miss out of his laundry list? 
Kevin Jacobs: I think you covered most of it. I think overall embedded in that cash burn -- those cash burn guidance is obviously an assumption of pretty extensive mitigation on our gross controllable expenses outside of G&A. And I'd say on an overall basis, we think we can over the course of the year mitigate about 60% of the gross controllable expenses, but that's all embedded in the cash burn assumption. I think you actually said the third quarter was going to be the worst, but we think the second quarter ….
Chris Nassetta : Second quarter. I did say that?
Kevin Jacobs : Yes, second quarter. I've already skipped the quarter. Yes, second quarter recovery to a degree. Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. 
Carlo Santarelli : Kevin, acknowledging that, that you mentioned kind of NUG, half of the 6 to 7 you were prior -- you were previously looking for, for this year. How much of that call it 300 basis points to 350 basis points of NUG erosion for this year relates to just delays in the pipeline that we will see come through presumably next year. And how much of that is just stuff that that maybe was early and has a lower likelihood at this point of getting finished? So, more or less even if you want to take a bigger picture approach, when you think about the opportunities for conversions and whatnot, looking out to ‘21, ‘22, ‘23 etcetera, are you still reasonably comfortable in kind of a mid single-digit net unit growth baseline for those years? 
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, so here's what I would say, Carlo, and obviously a good question. Virtually all of the decline in our outlook for NUG for this year is due to delays related to COVID-19. Meaning, we do have in our guidance is always an embedded assumption for conversions. And I'll come back to that, I know that's part of your question. But the decline is really entirely related to delays because going into the year, even for a limited service hotel, if something is expected to open this year, it's going to be under construction this year, right? So, as of -- about a third of the hotels that we had under construction that we expected to open this year, went into some form of suspension over the last month or so as part of the crisis. About half of those that went under suspension are already back under construction, but they're going to be somewhat delayed, right, obviously, because they suspended. And about half of them, the other half we think will resume construction, largely every project we think will resume construction over the balance of year. There certainly will be onesies, twosies of things where a deal might not make sense. But generally, once the hotel starts construction, it opens, right? And so, what that means is almost all of it will push into next year.  So as a result, we think that whatever this year ends up being will be the bottom and that will climb back from there. And yes, on a run rate basis, once we get back to normal, we're more than comfortable with a mid single-digit NUG growth rate. And we think that conversions, there will be some period of time where, obviously at the moment -- although we are working on some conversions as we speak, we're working on a bunch of them actually, but at the moment transaction activity is relatively limited. But in general, we think the crisis will probably create more opportunities than it hurts. And so, hopefully that covers.
Carlo Santarelli : Yes. That did, Kevin, thank you very much. And then if I could just one quick follow up. When you guys think about the financial crisis and the resumption, obviously it was different circumstances and whatnot, but speaking specifically to the Group elements of the business, when you think about the recovery in that era, on the Group side relative to now, and based on obviously the positive traction you guys have had with re-bookings and some sales progress on future periods, et cetera, what are you hearing or what do you view as being kind of the key differentiators between that Group recovery and getting kind of adequate pricing back on the books, et cetera in this period relative to that period?
Chris Nassetta: Well, there are going to be a lot of similarities, Carlo, and then some differences as you might guess. I mean, I think that the economic fallout we'll see -- I mean, I think the economic fallout here is likely to be greater. And then you put on top of that a mobility issue and a health and hygiene issue, which is people not wanting to for a period of time until maybe there's a vaccine or therapeutics or we get past this, not wanting to congregate in large groups. So, I think being pragmatic about it, and just straight forward about it, I think Group always is the last to recover. In the 30 whatever years I've been doing this and going through these ups and downs, Group is the last recovers for no other reason that it's longer lead business, right? So, it's sort of logical. I think here it will be a little longer than normal because of those factors. I think the economic impact is going to be greater than most of what we've seen in my time, and we have to get -- people are going to have to sort of not only just come out of their foxholes, but ultimately get comfortable congregating again. All of that I think will happen. By the way, I think the business, when you get two or three years out, will look a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it looks right now. I think it will look very, very similar to it. But I think, it's going to take time and progression. It's going to depend on what happens with reopening. It's going to depend on what happens with how we fight COVID-19. It's going to depend on things that are unknowns today, which is where we end up with vaccines and therapeutics. I'm super optimistic based on the people I'm talking to about those things. But I'm not a health expert and I'm not in the pharma business and I don't know. But those things are all sort of variables that it is just too early to judge.  So, I think, the simple answer would be -- I think, what would the contours of this recovery, like prior recoveries to a degree, with a little bit of nuance will be leisure transient first, business transient second, and group third. I think they're all going to be a little bit different in contours than prior cycles for obvious reasons of the impact of COVID-19 being different in terms of the impact that it has on people and business. But I think that, that is the progression. And while you didn't ask it, I'll say it, I do think as we get in – correcting -- thank you for correcting me, Kevin, I do think Q2 is going to be very bad because we know that. I do think you will start as we get reopening around the world and America is moving again, if the government and the state -- federal government and state governments are responsible, I've been on the council for reopening and so I think there's a sensible dialogue going on there. You will start to see a recovery in as you get into Q3 in my opinion in Q4, I think that the initial stages of that just given how very low Q2 is, will look like a pretty decent snapback but trying to -- but I don't want to be pollyannaish. Getting back to sort of the levels of occupancy, like for us that were in the low to -- low mid 70s in 2019, which were all time highs, that's going to take time. I think you will see the down, you'll see a bit of a snapback as you get mobility off of a very low levels and then I think you're going to sort of slowly recover, as people get more comfort and businesses start to get back in business, start to think about hiring and investing and all those kind of things. And that, as I said in my prepared comments that's going to take two or three years to get back in my opinion to those levels and that's the -- my honest view. The truth is, this thing is moving really fast. So -- and there are a lot of unknowns, as I just said. So, that's my view, based on what I see and I've seen a lot and talked to a lot of people, but time will tell, which is exactly why we haven't given guidance because it's just too early to know. But everybody on this call knows I'm a born optimist, and that will never change. So, I feel spectacularly good about the long-term for the industry. I feel spectacularly good about our model and the long-term opportunities for Hilton and we just sort of have to go through a period of time to rebuild and get back on our feet as an industry and a company to get back to where we were.
Operator: And our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.
Harry Curtis : Hi, Chris. Given your vast experience through prior recessions, let's go back to 2008 and ‘09 where there was a significant amount of handwringing about the impact of video conferencing on corporate travel. And it didn't really pan out. Do you think it pans out in the recovery and I know it's anybody's guess, but is it different this time do you think?
Chris Nassetta: I mean, it's anybody's guess. I mean, certainly I've done more WebEx meetings and Zoom than I ever want to do in my life. I don't know about all of you. Maybe it's [indiscernible] -- I'm tired of it. The last thing I'm going to want to do when I get done with this is do another video conference and I'm by the way hearing that from a lot of people. So, the honest answer is, I don't know. I would say, on the margin, yes, there's going to be certain trip occasions where maybe because people have become more accustomed to this out of necessity to sort of be able to function that they'll think, well, I can do that. I don't have to do a trip. But I think much like the debates that I've been part of for the last 20 or 30 years is has evolved, I think it is an unstoppable force that people want to travel and see each other and meet to, to build relationships, whether that is personal or related to business. I don't think that will change. I don't think globalization is going to stop. I don't think the need for people to travel the world is going to stop. And I am highly confident we can all wake up in two or three years -- and you can tell me I was right or wrong, but I am highly confident and as I said, when you wake up at two or three years, the world's going to -- it's hard to see it now, the world is going to look awful a lot like it did 90 days ago in terms of customer behavior and demand patterns, and alike. There will be some differences. As I said, maybe on the margin, there's some business transient where people do it, but I think they're going to want to see people. They're going to be other things that happened, that changed, but it's going to be things I think that were sort of forming where it will accelerate other things, like our digital key, digital check-in which we've had great adoption. I think we'll have massive adoption. Connected room, where you get in a room, you don't have to mess with the remote control or touch switches. I think people will sort of adopt those things.  So, I think, the digital world was already very important to us. I think it's going to get more important because some of those trends are going to be accelerated. But I do not -- I wake up at night, thinking about a lot of things these days. I do sleep, but I get up awfully early as I told Kevin. But I do not worry that people are not going to want to see each other, meet with each other and ultimately congregate. I think that is the human condition, and I think there is an argument that on the margin I described, it could take some trip occasions. There's also, I think an even better argument that people are going to want to see people more than ever. They just need to feel safe, right? And I think when they feel safe, they will go back largely to their own patterns and behaviors. Looking at the great -- looking at prior activities, I think 9/11 is probably the most instructive, while it's not the same, because none of this is unprecedented as we keep saying, there's some lessons that were learned there. Like, basically everybody said, well, after 9/11, nobody traveled, they did. Video conferencing wasn't as good, but they figured out other ways to do things, because they were afraid to get on planes and travel and go out. You're fast forward, two or three years, we had figured out how to manage the world and figured out how to not get rid of terrorism but manage it. And people went back largely to their prior behaviors with it. It did accelerate a few things that were not, frankly I would argue, harmful that were probably helpful. I think, the same thing is going to happen here. I think as we get through this and we realize that COVID-19 and these types of viruses are a part of our future, they have been, we have dealt with the seasonal flu. There was a time where dealing with the seasonal flu felt like this. That we will figure out as a global community how to deal with this. We will hopefully have a vaccine. Time will tell. We will certainly have more therapeutics. We will certainly have better practices and procedures to make sure that we protect the very small part of the global population that is really, truly most impacted by this. And I think as people then start to feel like this is a safe environment, they are going to go back largely to their old behaviors, I would bet a lot of money on it. And that's what history would tell you.
Harry Curtis: And as a quick follow up, what are your peers in the airline industry telling you about the pace of their restart?
Chris Nassetta: I would say I have been talking to a lot of my peers, but looking at the data, to be honest, I thought at least in the last couple weeks, and in these days it's like every week makes a difference. But based on the conversations I have had over the last couple -- over the last month or two and then just looking at the data, I think while we're not in some -- let's be clear we're not showing robust recovery trends right now, I said we are like teeny type in China we are, but the rest of the world, it's like teeny tiny step forward. I think the airlines are way behind. And if you just look at the passenger mile data, how many enplanements, they're just way behind and here's the thing. That's because people are real -- those that are willing to travel are only willing to go so far from home. So, as I think about our team, you didn't ask, but I'll answer because we're spending an immense amount of time on recovery. I spent -- I had all 500 of our commercial leaders around the world on a Zoom call yesterday and talking about how we're retooling our approach to go to market over the next 6, 12, whatever it takes, 18 months, and that is going to be really much more about local business and a lot more in the beginning about drive to business, right?  So, if you if you think about it, I mean, sort of the natural human reaction is like I'm going -- I want to move, I want to get out, I'm starting to feel safe, I'm going to get out of my house, I'm going to go to my neighborhood, maybe I'll sort of move around the region, maybe I'll go to the region next door, eventually I'm going across the country, I'm going to get on a plane go around the world, but I think it's in that progression. So, if you think about it that way, while we've seen a little bit of pickup, I would argue, almost all of it has been in drive-to. And we -- thankfully, we have a big portfolio, a lot of brands, we have a lot of drive, we have in the world 2,600 or 2,700 Hampton Inns. And we have thousands, I think limited service hotels in the U.S., we have almost 4.000 of them and they are very well set up for that sort of local street corner type business and drive-to business.  So, I think there's a little bit of a disconnect, and there will be for a period of time where I think we will likely show I think recovery at a faster pace because we can accommodate types of demand that don't require travel. Ultimately, we need airlines. We need people to get on planes to get to the nirvana, which is back to more normal patterns of demand. Obviously, that has to happen. But in the short-term, I think it's going to be a little bit more local or little a bit more drive-to and in our industry, if you can accommodate that business it’s going to be ahead of you. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Shaun Kelley: So, Chris, I wanted to switch the subject a little bit to kind of the franchisee side of the world here. I was just wondering if you'd give us a little bit more color on how some of those conversations are going with your franchise partners. If it's possible, and I appreciate it's both early stage and it may be hard to give these numbers, but any sort of sense of magnitude of either asks of how many of your franchisees are looking for any form of fee relief or what that dialogue is kind of looking like right now?
Chris Nassetta: Sure. So this is something I commented on for a good reason in my prepared comments as we're spending as you would guess a huge amount of time with our franchise and broader ownership community because they are the engine of our growth and they are our most important partners in business. And times are difficult for everybody, but times are more difficult for them given the situation, which is no -- essentially no demand or very little demand yet, even with furloughs and all those things, they still have to pay debt service. They still have to pay for insurance and real estate taxes and utilities and all that kind of stuff. So, we've had a multi-tiered approach. I'd say, first and foremost, and I talked about it a little bit, a very little bit. We and I have been deeply involved in what's been going on with the Federal Government, both with the administration and on the hill to try and get liquidity relief for the industry, which is our ownership community, and frankly trying to get relief for our frontline team members that have been furloughed and not in any way relief for Hilton. We don't need it. We have not asked for it in any way, shape or form. But we have been pushing really hard with the administration, treasury. I've had lots of conversations with all the right people, including the President, Secretary Mnuchin throughout the PPP. Reality is, I could go on a long time, you don't want me to. PPP is a really good program and Congress and the administration should be given a lot of credit for moving that fast and getting that much money into the system that will help owners and small business folks. And ultimately employees keep -- stay on the payroll. Reality is, for our industry, it hasn't been as -- just because of the complexity of ownership structures and alike, it has not been that helpful. The second wave hopefully is more helpful. But the fed getting ready to launch a Main Street Lending Program, which we're working very hard on to make sure that there is more access. And so, a bunch of our owners by the way, lots and lots, dozens and dozens have had access to PPP. We're hoping that a much larger set of them get access to Main Street Lending Program. And so, that is an important part of what we're doing because they need a bridge, right? I mean ultimately we're also working with the administration on stimulus for the industry when we get the other side to get demand going and people reemploy but right now our owners need a bridge. So, we've been working very hard in that regard.  We also, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, have done tons of things in terms of by the way suspending operations at 950 hotels. We've never done that, right? In the 100 years we've been around, other than closing a hotel to tear it down or whatever, we've never done that. We've suspended massive amounts of our brand standards, operating standards, capital programs and a whole bunch of other things to sort of really give them huge flexibility in how they operate, which I think they have appreciated. As I also mentioned, one of the most important things that we're doing right now which I'm spending and our team is spending an immense amount of time on, which I mentioned very lightly is the hotel operating model of the future. We're working with all of our owners, franchisees across every brand, every category to figure out -- we've already done the short-term, but intermediate and long term. How do we use this time -- necessity, as I like to say, does become the mother of invention. To think about things that we've been exploring or thinking about -- and that we think makes sense to create more efficiency, what better time to sort of think about our standards and sort of put them all in the bucket and really put a bright light on them. And so we're doing that with deep involvement of our owner advisory councils. We kicked this off a couple weeks ago and we're in full swing and that's incredibly important work as we again get to the other side and hopefully get stimulus from the government, which I think we will, and that we create an opportunity in the intermediate term for them to be able to operate at lower demand levels and still have profitability and in longer term, as we get back to normal have even greater levels of profitability than when we went into it.  In terms of fee relief, I would say you wouldn't be surprised to hear that there have been owners that have asked for fee relief. But not -- hand over fist and the reality is, I think there's a real simple reason, our fee structure as you know which is different for different players in the industry, all of our fee structures, whether it's the franchise fee or management fee or the system charges, they're all based on a percentage of revenue. So, we have given the ultimate fee relief, meaning when you're 90% off, there really aren't many fees because there's not much revenue. And so I think most of the owners -- everybody would like every bit of help that they can get. I think most of the owners that I have talked to sort of understand that the fees have been right sized with the demand in the business that they're not at the moment sadly for us and sadly for them, they're not paying us a lot of fees in any event, so that we will continue to look at all options with our community. As we said there is no more important partner and stakeholder that we have. They are the engine of opportunity for us. They're investing all the capital they have been and I believe they will -- as Kevin noted with the pipeline and NUG numbers, they will continue to do so.  And so we are literally in personally I'm in daily conversations with huge numbers of them. And I think you can ask them yourself, and while we're never going to be perfect, so far the feedback I get from our owner community and you can validate it, is very high marks. That we were there earlier than most understanding the severity of this. We took very decisive and bold actions to provide relief early. And again, while we're not perfect my impression in the owners and I'm talking to hundreds of them is while they're hurting, they are certainly appreciating the partnership that we have provided.
Shaun Kelley : And then maybe a little bit more of a specific one for Kevin, I guess. Kevin could you outline for us a little bit more on maybe just this kind of point in time working capital drag that we could potentially see as it relates to mismatching on reimbursed costs. Primarily I think it's the system fund but anything else that maybe investors should be aware of just given the situation we're in when the music stops and drops as much as it is, kind of where cash could be trapped for a period of time and then how you expect to recover that down the road?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, sure. Obviously, it's a question that's on a lot of people's minds. So, it's a good one. I think to take a step back if you think about, there's really three buckets of receivables that we have, right? In hotels that we manage which is a minority of the system, right, roughly 70% of the system is franchised. But in hotels that we manage, the owners are responsible for the working capital and all the obligations and some of those ultimately are paid by us and then reimbursed by owners. So there's an opportunity there. Then you have license fees and then system charges as Chris mentioned in his buildup. So those are the three primary buckets.  What I would say in terms of sizing it, first of all, it's really early, right? So if you think about the crisis really starting in March, you don't even build these things until the following month and then you give people 30 days to pay. And so, we're sort of just getting into it. So anything we would say there would be speculative. But that said, embedded -- I think it's probably obvious, but we're saying embedded in the discussion that we've given you both publicly and in some of Chris' commentary earlier is, a working capital of drag, whereas we've said if things stay the way they are, meaning circa 90% down in revenue and in this environment, we have at least 24 months of liquidity and you've got our cash balance. And so, you can sort of just do the math and realize that if things stay the way they are, there is an embedded cash drag in there that could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars ultimately. And so -- but of course, it depends on duration of the cycle, how it plays out? And ultimately, we believe as Chris just got done explaining that, the business is healthy. It's going to come back and when it comes back, we think we're going to get paid.
Operator: And our next question comes from Anthony Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Anthony Powell: So, longer term, how do you think this event changes the financing market for new hotel construction? Do you think lenders may require higher equity contributions or higher cash reserves? And could it be a headwind for construction and your net unit growth over the medium to longer term?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. That's a good question, Anthony. And the reality is, we don't really know. But what I think is that, generally when you come out of these crises, lenders get appropriately more cautious. Although I would say that, even pre-COVID, we were pretty deep into an economic cycle. And so, you were starting to see caution. That said, over the long-term, I would say, for construction, most of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually even financed aggressively. When you're talking about like big full service hotels and luxury hotels, sometimes they use more leverage, but the lion's share of the hotels that get built in our system are not actually financed all that aggressively. You're talking about like 50% loan to cost. And I would say, personally I think that when the business recovers, the lending community will be there and as long as hotels are productive and profitable investments that they'll be able to be financed. And then I think the last thing I'd add is, you have to remember the amount of liquidity that is in the system. Pre-COVID you're talking about like tripling plus of the money supply from quantitative easing and then even more capital being injected into systems globally. There's going to be plenty of capital looking for productive yields. And I would say, for some period of time it will be a distressed environment and then as it always does, it will recover back to normal.
Anthony Powell: Got it. And then just one more. You mentioned that you’ve relaxed brand standards across the board which helped owners. How do you manage that with customer expectations as you start to see recovery? Hilton Honors has been known for a very consistent experience across the board, customers are going to be returning to see no breakfast buffets or whatnot. How do you manage that going forward?
Chris Nassetta: It's a really good question. I think in the short-term, as we've been talking to customers and serving customers, everybody gets what's going on in the world. So, they're incredibly lenient. And so, we have not serving sadly, that many customers but those that we are -- who are mostly on the frontlines of recovery efforts have been fine with all of the standard changes in suspension of certain elements of the service. The work that I described that we're doing is sort of in the intermediate and long-term in making sure that we; one, create the most efficient operating model; and two, obviously, continue as implied to your question to drive premium market share. I mean, we're not -- we continue to have the premium market share in the industry, we have no plans to give that up. The trick is, as we transition from the intermediate to the longer term, what are the things that you basically put back into the standards and what do you take -- what do you leave out and/or change. And that's sort of I can't give you the answer and not because I don't want to, I don't have it yet. I mean, that's the work that we are doing right now. I suspect that what we will do is test a whole bunch of different things. I know we will, as well others during the intermediate timeframe when customers are very forgiving, and what we're going to do is iterate, with the objective of making sure that we are delivering premium product and service always to get our market share premium, but we want to drive efficiency. So, short-term is easy, intermediate term, I think will be a significant opportunity for testing when you're still in a relatively low demand environment where customers are still quite sort of accepting of things that are different. And then I think what we learn in that intermediate timeframe, we will sort of institute as our longer range standards and we're working through all of that.  I think there'll be a whole bunch of things that we'll do that'll be more efficient long-term, and they're going to be some that we're going to have some standards that we are going to -- that our customers are going to want in a more normalized environment and we're going to reinstitute. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question?
Stephen Grambling : Two related follow ups. First, on the working capital drag you cited in the hundreds of millions of dollars potentially. You mentioned, it depends on how long this will last. So, on the cash burn and monthly liquidity you provided in the debt deal, I think you were assuming that this is -- or maybe you can elaborate on whether you're assuming this is a consistent drag each quarter or if that would potentially moderate even if things remain weak? And then second, can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from consumers as it relates to the loyalty program. You have some of the partnerships you have and how that may impact the model both during this period and then also how you ensure customer engagement to position yourself to use this asset and take share in eventual recovery?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, so on the working capital, Stephen, I would say, look the assumptions that we gave publicly which again just to make sure everything -- everyone's clear as part of the bond deal, we said 18 to 24 months, that was pre-money for the bond deal and we ended up upsizing that deal. So, that's sort of how you get to the longer end of that range. I would say that. Again when the crisis is new, things are a little sharper. So, I would -- the way I'd characterize it is, the first month, second quarter of this year probably would be the worst on that front and then it would moderate from there. But again, the assumption....
Stephen Grambling: The assumption to get to the 24 months -- or at least 24 months are basically you have little or no ….
Chris Nassetta: Yes, you stay that way. 
Kevin Jacobs: And from that perspective, again, I said it would be a little bit harsher at the beginning and then it would be relatively flat again in that under those assumptions, with any kind of recovery curve, it gets better from there.
Stephen Grambling : And then on the loyalty program side just any color you can provide on that?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. We have done a bunch of things if you look at it I'd say. First of all, not that we have a lot of business, but our Honors occupancy with the modest business we have has skyrocketed. So, it was already very high and now it's a lot higher because seemingly they are more willing to travel than I guess non-Honors members. But, what we've been focused on during this timeframe and you can see it in a lot of the things I talked about and that you would see publicly is, people aren't traveling that much. So, what can we do to build loyalty? We can give them flexibility, so we -- in the industry, we were the first ones, I believe. Certainly we were very early to come out and give very significant cancellation flexibility. We were definitely the first to come out and give status, allow people to remain -- keep their status. We were definitely the first to come out and say, we weren't going to -- we are not going to have points expire. We did a bunch of things to say to our Honors members, no fault of your own, you can't travel and we're not going to hold that against you. We've been communicating with them regularly. And so far, I'd say that's going well. The work that we're doing in the community, we're doing that because we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. So, our 1 million room nights with AMEX to first responders for free, our World Central Kitchen work, all of the other work that we're doing is about sort of continuing to build our brand, the Honors brand with consumers who are sitting around and can't move but are watching a lot of TV and reading a lot, doing a lot of social media and they're seeing these things. The net result is, in terms of our numbers, our marketing team has been looking at it, like intent to consider purchase of our product, Net Promoter Score, whatever, those numbers have gone way up through the crisis. As a result, people realizing, we're doing the right things. And so, my attitude, which is the way I think about life, when you go into this, just like the way I thought about it when we went into the great recession, which was different. But similar is, when everything is good, it's really hard to differentiate yourself. I mean, I think we have -- I think we've done a great job, but you get caught up in an arms race. When everything is bad, people peel off and go different directions and you have a real opportunity to differentiate yourself. And so, what I said from the day we got in this crisis is, as much as we need to solidify the core and deal with liquidity with Kevin and the team have done an amazing job on and protects -- and deal with the cost structure and all the things, we have been crazy focused on making sure we are listening to customers, particularly Honors members and doing the right thing for them, that we are crazy focused on our owners, as I've already talked a lot about to do everything we can for them, that we're crazy involved in our communities so that people remember that, because we’re part of the solution because that will continue to build loyalty. And obviously as impactful as it has been to our team members that as we're impacting them, we're doing it in the right way, in a way that is really taking care of them as best we can. And so, my attitude is, well, this is all painful, there's no other way to describe it. What we do now, will determine our future, and we are absolutely committed as a team and a company to continue to differentiate ourselves with all of our stakeholders and to come out the other side of this stronger, including with our Honors members. And so far, we’re I think doing a very good job doing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. 
Bill Crow : Based on your discussion, I think it was with Harry earlier. It sounds like your view is that the primary gating factor for travel is not the hotel, it’s the airplane -- airline. And if that's the case, is it fair to suggest that no matter how much they discount fares, it's probably not going to be as stimulative as it would have been in prior downturns. And then the second part of that is, does that also mean that the larger coastal gateway and markets come back far later than the rest of the country?
Chris Nassetta: Well, to a degree yes, but let me let me reframe it a little bit. What I was saying which is right. To get back to full recovery, I think the airlines are a gating issue. People have to be comfortable to get on planes, planes have to be flying, there's a bunch of the business particularly in the big -- in the major markets that are -- that is flied to. And so to get to full recovery you have to have that. I absolutely believe you can get a significant amount of recovery before you get there. I think, Bill I wish I had all the answers. I think it's wrapped up in a whole bunch of different things that relate to what's going on with vaccines, therapeutics, human nature and just the comfort factor. My own belief is as you continue to get more testing, which is what I've been reinforcing with the White House and everybody that will listen and including antibody testing, that you are going to understand that because the data is pretty clear that while this is a terrible virus and it's affecting people's lives and it's killing people, which is horrific and every life is important, when you get down to it, it has infected a lot more people that we know and the mortality rate is much, much lower than people have thought and the real data suggests there's a very small part of the population that is really at risk.  I think the more of the testing data that comes out even without a vaccine or a therapeutic, the more people are going -- particularly those that are not at risk, the more comfort that they are going to have. With a vaccine and/or therapeutics, I think it's game changing. And so, I'm not trying to be evasive. I just think it's going to be iterative. I think you're going to have drive-to business, you're going to have some fly-to business, people are going to socially space, wear a mask and all that, and there will be people that go out. The more they understand the real mortality rate, the more therapeutics and/or vaccine progress we have. I think if will, as I said two or three different times, I think when you wake up in a couple of years, it'll feel a lot more like it did 90 days ago than it does now and the past depends on a whole bunch of variables that are not particularly well known. But I think that it will progress, we will recover first with more drive-to, some fly-to and that will happen. I mean, people are -- you're going to -- this summer, you start looking at the airline numbers and you're going to see a big shift, up. It's not going to be anywhere near where it was, but in my opinion, this summer, you will see a heck of a lot more people getting on planes and in airports than you see right now. So, I think it's just going to be a progression. 
Bill Crow: I hope you're right. Chris, if I can just follow up with one other question that I'm not sure you can answer. But as you look out, you talked about two, three, four years out using this period for innovation and whatnot. Do you think the operating cost or cost per occupied room will be lower or higher as we start to stabilize this industry?
Kevin Jacobs: Lower, for sure. Lower. I mean just because all the things that we're working on, I can't tell you how much lower, because I don't have the answer yet. But clearly, I mean, there are a few things Bill as you might guess that, that are going to cost a little bit more like our CleanStay standard working with Lysol and Mayo. Yes, Lysol products may be a little more expensive than some of the products, that's relatively insignificant. Other things that we're thinking about in terms of garnering efficiencies vastly outweigh that. So I think when we wake up on a stabilized basis, operating costs are going to go down.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to follow up on the unit growth question and I appreciate how difficult it is to have visibility on this. You were talking about financing that there will be capital available. But I guess just thinking about from a perspective of owner appetite and when you look at historic downturns, anything under construction as you pointed out would open and the decline or like a slower rate of growth typically in supplies would usually come a year or two later because of those new projects. So, I wonder if you could talk about kind of owner appetite. It seems like given even what you're saying about how it could take a couple of years to get back to 2019 levels, that may be an owner or developer that hasn't put a shovel in the ground yet, would be rethinking anything that's not under construction. And then, we would see something much lower than mid single-digit growth in terms of pipeline kind of a year or so out from now?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I think, listen, it's a good point Robin. And certainly that is generally how it worked last time, although not really. I mean, I think the first year after the great financial crisis was the low point and then it sort of started building from there. There was another year in 2012 where we were sort of stayed low/went down a touch because of what you're describing. The difference this time is, it's delayed, right? I mean it's a different crisis and you've just got construction that's being suspended. Things are going to take longer and it's going to push. And then the other thing is you've had -- this is coming at the end of the cycle. So, you just had -- you've had a bunch of deliveries and their existing hotels and there's going to be a little bit less demand for a while and we think more demand for our engine. So, we do think we'll drive a higher level of conversions going forward. And thus, we think a growing trajectory from here. We'll see what happens, but that's what we think.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then one other sort of point on the same topic is, we've looked at all the data historically for hotel removals, right, hotels that closed and never reopened in previous downturns. And interestingly, that doesn't go up a lot, even in '09 that wasn't really that much above average. I would assume that you don't expect removals to be at a higher rate this year is with this issue as well or I mean, but tell me if that's not?
Kevin Jacobs: No, that's accurate. That's accurate. We think removals will be very normal.
Operator: And our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Thomas Allen : Just in terms of buybacks, just wanted to -- so, in the prepared remarks in the press release that said, Hilton formally suspend your buyback program, the program remains authorized and you may resume share purchases in the future at any time. How do you think about the buyback program, how do you think about the right leverage levels, any thought there would be helpful? Thank you. 
Chris Nassetta: Yes, a really good question. And I'd say a little bit early given where we are to have sort of be dispositive about it. But I don't think long-term we have a -- in the short-term we're not going to be doing dividends and buybacks. We've made that pretty clear. As we get back to recovery and more normalized environment, I don't think our capital allocation strategy has really changed. One might argue even though I think from a liquidity point of view, we find ourselves in a really good position and we did the right things not just post-crisis, but pre-crisis in terms of having credit available, maturity schedule that was very attractive, those weren't lucky. I mean we knew we were at the end of a business cycle, and those are things that we planned out to make sure that we had all the financial flexibility we would need now we know we would have COVID-19, of course not. But we knew we're at the end of the business cycle, and we wanted to have being really set up well for it, and so we are. And so I'd say the this should hopefully be the greatest test of all time for a balance sheet. It's hard to believe another one can be worse given what's happened and I think we feel like we're in a really good position to sort of pass that test and have the liquidity and the credit profile to get through it.  So, I don't think when we get back to a normalized environment, we have a too much of a different view. What I can say is you could argue about would you be a little bit lower leverage than you might have been? I'm sure we will debate that and this isn't the time to conclude that. But more broadly, we will definitely resume at some point when we get to a normalized environment. I believe our intention would be to resume sort of where we left off in terms of our capital allocation strategy. 
Chris Nassetta: Okay. I think that's it. Well, it's an interesting call and interesting times. We appreciate everybody's time. I know, we've been talking with lots of people sort of as this has been going on obviously, happy to continue doing that as we work our way through this. As we sad in our comments second quarter will not be pretty, but hopefully third quarter and fourth will be back on the road to recovery. So, everybody stay safe, stay well and we're going to keep working awfully hard to do the right things here and we'll look forward to catching up with you and updating you on where we are after the second quarter. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we will conclude today's conference. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.We're happy to report that our 100th year of hospitality was one of our strongest yet. We delivered record growth and industry-leading innovations, while further strengthening the positive impact we're having in the communities we serve all around the world.For the full year, we grew adjusted EBITDA 10% and adjusted EPS 14%, both ahead of our expectations. System-wide RevPAR growth grew nearly 1% for the year largely consistent with our recent guidance.Our brands continue to perform well achieving the strongest market share gains we've seen in a decade. Despite a more challenging environment that weighed on our top line. We also demonstrated the power of our business model and disciplined capital allocation strategy by returning more than $1.7 billion or 8% of our market cap to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.Turning to results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS grew in the high single-digit range – range exceeding our expectations. RevPAR declined 1% in the quarter as weaker-than-expected business transient performance offset leisure gains.Softer business investment trends, pressured results in the U.S. and slowing economic growth in China, trade tensions and ongoing protest in Hong Kong weighed on performance across Asia Pacific.As we look to the year ahead, excluding the potential impact of the coronavirus, which I'll discuss in a minute, we expect 2020 top line growth to be similar to modestly softer than 2019. Consumer sentiment remains strong, but macro forecasts continue to call for positive, but decelerating GDP and non-residential fixed investment growth.Forward group bookings remain up in the low-single-digits consistent with our prior quarter's commentary. With that backdrop, we expect leisure and group growth to continue to outperform business transient. On the supply side in the U.S., the growth forecast is slightly below the long-term average of 2% and is expected to modestly exceed demand growth for the year, which could pressure occupancy and limit rate growth.Given these macro trends before the impact of the coronavirus, we would expect flat to 1% RevPAR growth for the full year. Now as it relates to the coronavirus, it goes without saying that the safety and well-being of our team members and our guests remain a paramount priority as we continue to carefully monitor the situation. We're working with local governments and health authorities globally to best support our operations and our communities in impacted areas.While these are still early days drawing on the industry's experience with SARS and other similar situations, we've tried to estimate the potential impact on our business. Assuming the outbreak last around three to six months with an additional three to six month recovery period, for the full year, we would estimate a potential 100 basis point impact to comp system-wide RevPAR growth, assuming close hotels, ultimately wind up being non-comp.We would expect, roughly a 0.5 point impact in net unit growth, which would be largely within our guidance range, and a $25 million to $50 million impact a full year adjusted EBITDA. At this point, roughly 150 of our hotels in China, totaling approximately 33,000 rooms are closed.Turning to development, we continued to deliver on our commitment to capital like growth. 2019 marked our fifth consecutive year of record approvals, construction starts and openings. For the full year we achieved net unit growth of 6.6% also marking five consecutive years of net unit growth of approximately 6.5%. We opened more than a hotel a day, totaling approximately 470 properties and 65,000 rooms, growing our portfolio to more than 6,100 properties and 970,000 rooms across 119 countries and territories.Even with strong openings, we increase our pipeline 6% year-over-year to more than 387,000 rooms or roughly 40% of our existing base, driven by record approvals of more than 116,000 rooms. As a further testament to the high quality of our pipeline, we had record construction starts of nearly 87,000 rooms.In the U.S. starts increased 13% year-over-year with half of our global pipeline under construction. We remained confident in our ability to deliver at least 6% net unit growth for the next several years. We feel good about our future growth opportunities and ability to achieve our development goals, given our strong track record over the last decade.Since our go private transaction, we have doubled the size of our system with rooms in the U.S. up roughly 80%, internationally we've increased our portfolio size more than three times. Additionally, more than 70% of our current rooms under construction are located in international markets. We have added nine new brands to our system, doubling our portfolio of brands.Our discipline global development strategy has allowed us to reach more guests for more stay occasions and better leverage the power of our network effect. Last month we launched our newest brand Tempo by Hilton, the latest example of our ability to anticipate guests needs and deliver unmatched value for our customers and our owners.Tempo is a thoughtfully designed mid market lifestyle brand that empowers guests to prioritize well being and personal growth while traveling, all powered by an efficient service model. As with all of our organically developed brands, we created Tempo based on feedback from literally thousands of customers owners and team members. We're excited to have 60 deals in various stages of development at this point.In the fourth quarter, our award winning loyalty program reached 100 million members and ended the year with more than 103 million members. Honors members accounted for more than 64% of occupancy in the quarter of nearly 150 basis points year-over-year with features like Digital Key now live in the majority of our properties around the world, in our industry-leading connected room offering, we are using technology to deliver reliable friendly and memorable guest experiences.We also continue to hear great feedback from members on our partnerships, which enhance the utility of their points, strengthen our system and offer guests experiences that money can't buy. We recently expanded our partnership with Live Nation the world's leading live entertainment company to offer Hilton Honors members, even greater access to tickets and live music experiences. Additionally, our loyalty members can now earn and redeem honors points. When they ride with lift through our first of a kind partnership with a leading rideshare company.Looking beyond our industry leading brands and loyalty system, we're also proud to contribute to the communities we serve and lead our industry and corporate responsibility. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our operation opportunity goal to hire 30,000 veterans, military spouses and caregivers and expanded that commitment to hire an additional 25,000 by 2025. During the year, we were named the 2019 global industry leader on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the global standard for measuring and advancing corporate ESG practices.We were also the only hospitality company on Fortune's 2019 Change the World List for a second year in a row. Overall, 2019 was a remarkable year for us. We achieved record development growth, hit the 100 million Honors member milestone were named the number one great place to work in the United States, and continue to deliver on our commitment to serve any guests anywhere in the world for any travel news they have. As we look to the year ahead, we're confident in our ability to continue delivering for all of our Hilton stakeholders.With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results and our outlook for the future.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris, and good morning everyone.In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR decline 1% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as weaker than expected business transients demand and a soft group calendar offset moderate leisure growth. We estimate the calendar shifts and one-time events tempered system-wide RevPAR growth by roughly 90 basis points.Adjusted EBITDA of $586 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance range increasing 8% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better-than-expected license fees and greater cost control as well as roughly $10 million of timing and unique items that offset the impact of lower-than-expected RevPAR.In the quarter, management and franchise fees increased 5% to $558 million achieving the high-end of our expected range as strong net unit growth and better performance from our co-brand program offset softer top line performance. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $1 also beat expectations.Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR fell 80 basis points as softer corporate spending pressured business transient. For full year 2019, U.S. RevPAR grew 70 basis points as solid market share gains and good group performance were somewhat tempered by weak business transient trends in the latter half of the year. For full year 2020, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth consistent with our system-wide guidance given the expectation for relatively steady macro trends.In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR fell 3.2% versus the prior year, largely driven by business transient weakness across Canada and Mexico. For full year 2019, RevPAR grew 1%, driven by solid trends across South America and strong tourism in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.For full year 2020, we expect RevPAR in the region to increase in the low to mid single-digit range, largely driven by better-than-expected economic growth in Mexico and solid trends in Canada. RevPAR in Europe grew 1.4% in the quarter, led by continued growth across Continental Europe with particular strength in Turkey, but somewhat moderated by softer transient demand in the U.K.For the full year, RevPAR in Europe grew in line with our expectations increasing 3%, largely driven by solid group and leisure transient gains across Continental Europe and good international inbound to London. We expect full year 2020 RevPAR growth in Europe to be in the low single-digit range with steady trends across Continental Europe, partially offset by lingering uncertainty surrounding the next phase of Brexit.In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was down 4.3% in the quarter as political tensions in Lebanon and supply growth in the UAE continued to pressure rate. For the full year, RevPAR was down 3% in the region, largely due to outsized supply growth. For full year 2020, we expect RevPAR in the region to increase in the low single-digit range.In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR fell 3.8% in the quarter with RevPAR in China declining 7.8% due to the continued slowdown in leisure travel and ongoing protest in Hong Kong. For full year 2019, RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region was down 0.9%, driven by softening economic trends in China, trade tensions and the Hong Kong protests. RevPAR in China fell 3.2% for full year 2019.For full year 2020, unaffected by the coronavirus, our RevPAR growth expectations for the Asia Pacific region would be in line with our system-wide guidance with the benefit from the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, offsetting continued weakness in China.As the coronavirus situation continues to play out, we will try to give you more specific details of its effect on regional performance. But for now, we'll stick to giving you our preliminary enterprise-wide thoughts based on the assumptions that Chris laid out earlier.Moving to guidance for full year 2020 on an unaffected basis, we expect RevPAR growth of 0% to 1% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.42 billion to $2.47 billion. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $4.08 to $4.21. For the first quarter on an unaffected basis, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be roughly flat. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $520 million to $540 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.85 to $0.91.Our preliminary view of the potential impact of the coronavirus in the first quarter again, assuming our closed hotels are ultimately non-comp is that there could be a roughly 100 basis point to 150 basis point drag on system-wide RevPAR growth and a $10 million to $20 million impact to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases.Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $172 million in dividends for the year. For the full year 2019, we returned over $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends.In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For 2020 we expect to return between $1.6 billion and $2 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Chad, can we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: So thank for all the color on sort of the Coronavirus, and sort of your expectation. We understand it’s very, very early there. But maybe you could just help us unpack. I think as we've received some questions about it. I think people are just sort of looking for some of the color on maybe each of the components I think you're very clear on RevPAR. But could you help us understand maybe what you're just seeing on the ground as it relates to the development delays?And do you - it sounds like you think you can stay within the 6% to 7% guidance on NUG even possibly including some of those delays, but maybe just talk a little bit about that assumption a little bit more?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes maybe to take your last - the last part of the question first. Yes, that was what I said in my prepared comments. I mean in terms of net unit growth I mean obviously early days. But if we think about it this way a half a point which is what we've sort of said we think the impact would be half - roughly half our deliveries in China. If you took 100% of the deliveries out put it in perspective it would be a point.We do not think that will happen. We've already delivered 1,500-plus rooms in China this year. We opened the hotel yesterday. There are parts of China that are still business as usual in terms of deliveries. So, we do think that the half a point is reasonable to maybe conservative and is largely within the bounds of our 6% to 7%. In terms of the broader assumptions, again, I can't stress enough that this is really preliminary that - this is a, sort of evolving situation.We're reporting at a time where we know a bunch but not that much relative to where this thing is going. But we thought - the only responsible thing to do was to sort of look at historical perspective and give everybody the best sense that we have and use science around - the data that we have. So as we said briefly in the comments what we looked at is sort of in a range of outcomes three months to six months of the escalation and impact from the outbreak.And then these things don't turn around typically overnight. Another three months to six months on recovery so essentially a 6-month to 12-month period of time. And if you look at SARS and other things, again, this may play out entirely differently and we don't know. But if you look at prior history in the industry and impact, those seem to be sort of reasonable guardrails for how we see it today and that's how we develop those. And that is a holistic view when we gave you those numbers.It involves the impact that would ripple through from NUG. As I've talked about, it involves the impact in China, both for closures and lesser business. It involves outbound business leaving China and it incorporates all of that, again as scientifically as we can into the outputs. I mean, keeping in mind a couple of other stats and then I'll park it and I'm sure there'll be other questions that China represents China - in China for us 2.7% of the overall EBITDA of the company.If you look at system-wide revenues outside of China, it represents about 0.7% of system-wide revenues. In the United States, it represents about 0.2% of U.S. system-wide revenues, just to give context and perspective.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Maybe changing gears to something a little bit more long-term or strategic. Can you talk about your thought process as you build out some of the partnerships in the loyalty program. And perhaps, also provide a bit more color on how you're currently leveraging the customer data that you have from the program, as you think about marketing, personalization, et cetera?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes I think, without diving too deeply into things that are competitive. I would say, at a high level and much of this I've talked about, what we're trying to do is build a program where we can not only get membership up, but get a higher level of engagement. And that level of engagement as we look at it - and I look at it, it's not just about our highest tier members which of course, we want to keep super engaged, but getting engagement throughout the entire ecosystem.Because, in the end, what we're trying to do across the entire ecosystem is build direct relationships, because ultimately we know that it's a better experience for our customers and it's better for our owners, because it lowers our distribution cost. And so, we've had a bunch of different things. These partnerships are part of it. But, I think, if you started at the top of the order, it first has been - and this - was done a few years ago, about creating the best value.So when you're an Honors member you get the best price. When you're an Honors member, you get the best value, meaning that your points have real value. Whether you're a gold or a diamond at the highest levels, they obviously have value. But making sure that we have lower-tier members engaged as well and that - when you think about our Amazon deal, which I didn't talk about today.But we have in the past about the Lyft, earn and burn about Live Nation being able to buy tickets on Ticketmaster suddenly you have things that - you have relationships that allow all members to be engaged with us. And when they're buying things, using our points, whether it's nail clippers, or diapers on Amazon, or a ticket to go to a concert, it reminds them of why the relationship with Hilton matters and it.And we know that it drives more loyalty and repeat business. The other things that we're trying to do with Live Nation and others is, once in a lifetime experiences, particularly for our most loyal members, things that they just - money can't buy. And then technology, when we think about digital key, digital check-in, room selection, connected room and a whole bunch of other things that we're doing on the innovation side and technology.It's about not only just giving them the best price, the best value but then making sure that our Honors members are getting the best experience. And that we're using to answer your question we're using all of the data that we're getting in how we interact with them in every element of their stay to personalize and customize what they want, the room types they want. Where they want to be in a building, what their preferences are in food and beverage.How they interact with the outside environment - how, they interact with the inside environment of the hotel and the outside environment of the hotel. So, we're broadly starting to really harness all of the data to ultimately personalize at mass scale experiences that we think will continue to build loyalty. So again this is - the thing that we've been really crazy focused on really over the last five years in particular, is engagement across the whole ecosystem.And so, when you look at our 100-plus million members, over half of those members and growing are engaged. So that means by definition, we have a whole bunch of lower-tier members that are engaged with us meaning they are buying rooms from us. And we know when they become an Honors member that, it's high 90s percent of the time that they buy directly through us and thus help us keep distribution costs as efficient as possible.
Stephen Grambling: As an unrelated follow-up on the pipeline, I think one of the consistent concerns that comes up in investor conversations has been is there a point where RevPAR softening leads to software development and unit growth. As you have conversations and see underlying financials of your Honors, how do you assess the stability and strength of their financial returns both relative to history and perhaps also to other forms of real estate?
Christopher Nassetta: I feel pretty good about it I mean here's the thing. This is where having the best brands in the business matter. We talk a lot about market share. What matters most to developers is absolute market share, because that's what drives revenues for them when they build a new property, and we have the highest by a long stretch average market share of anybody in the industry. So, what's happening is we are getting a disproportionate amount of development even when it is difficult in an environment like the U.S.Where costs have gone up, cost of financing, cost to build, RevPARs are tepid we are still ultimately doing pretty well. I mean our starts - while signings have continued since 2016 to go down, starts actually had been going down and flipped around in the U.S. using that as an example. We were up about 13% in starts in the U.S., which I think is a testament to the fact that our brands are performing well enough where we're getting a disproportionate.Even though it's a smaller pool we're getting a bigger piece of a smaller pool. The other thing I'd say that's a really important notice, the world is a big place. I mean - - the reason we gave the stats on what we've done over 10 years and what we've done over five years is to give sort of a little context for the fact that during that timeframe we went through the Great Recession. We've had all sorts of good and bad things happening over that timeframe.Yet, we have always been able to sort of pivot and find the pockets of demand and where capital is available to continue to grow and grow in a way that our owners are profiting. But also, we're continuing to build our network effect so that we're continuing to strengthen our overall ecosystem for our customers.And so, the world is a big place. The U.S. has been in a slowing mode in development. We've been doing fine, but it has been slowing. I suspect in a low growth environment that will continue to happen. I suspect we'll continue to get it a disproportionate share of it if we do our job and we intend to.But the world is a big place and we're - we continue every year. That's why we point out sign more deals, start more deals, and ultimately deliver more deals because we have an ability we've being a big global business and with brands that are performing equally well around the world and relationships that are very deep around the world to pivot and be strategic about where we're going and who we're growing with.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Go ahead Mr. Greff, perhaps your line is muted on your end. We're still unable to hear you.We'll move on to our next question and that's from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Kevin maybe you'd be able to discuss a little bit. Could you talk a little bit about the lower expectations for G&A as we look out to 2020 kind of what's driving that? If I recall 2019 was flattish on that line.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think Carlo if you look at - I mean I think about it as sort of midpoint of prior guidance relative to midpoint of future. So, first of all, it's just I think better cost control. We do a pretty good job in the business of being disciplined about costs. And at its core, next year versus this year is about better cost control.And we did have some - a couple of - a few unique items that pushed 2019 up to the high end of our previously reported guidance range. And those are non-cash and non-recurring, so they're not going to repeat next year which gives us a bit of a headwind. It's not more - that much more complicated than that.
Carlo Santarelli: And then just one other on kind of the pipeline or the net unit growth in 2019. Are you guys able to provide any color on kind of the split between new units relative to conversions both in the U.S. - or primarily in the U.S.?
Christopher Nassetta: And the way I would look at it is most of the conversions occur in the U.S. not all, but most. And it was roughly 80/20 new units versus conversions, which is what it's been for the last few years.
Operator: The next question is from Harry Curtis with Instinet.
Harry Curtis: Just a quick follow-up on the domestic development pipeline. As you travel around the country and look at the age and relevance and competitiveness of some of the older hotels in the bigger markets, what I'm wondering is the 70% of your pipeline being international. In the U.S., is it not an opportunity to - given the age of these competitive hotels to begin focusing on that as a development opportunity? What are the returns there to the owners?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. That's a great question and the answer is yes. And that is not something that we have missed. We've been focused on it I'd say in a couple of primary ways and a bunch of other ancillary ways. The first is in conversions which as the operating environment gets more difficult as I've said lots of different times, I think it provides a bigger and bigger opportunity for people to want to come into our system because they get higher market share, they can reduce cost because we have ability with our system, size, and strength to drive better distribution costs and the like. So that is one way where we can continue to grow even when there may be lesser new construction.The other that involves new construction - the other major way are some of the new brands that we've developed, that I think are, in a sense, category killers. I think Tru being the greatest example of that, where we launched a couple of years ago, we have over 100 hotels open, another 350, 400, in the pipeline. It is like a rocket ship.And the answer to the question of, why is because of what you're saying, it is competing in a category where the bulk of the product, with all respect to its comp set, our older hotels that are not relevant to today's customers' needs.And so, that to a degree, by the way, we are trying to do in a whole bunch of different segments. So I think if you look at Tempo, to a degree, there is a bit of that. We think that product is something that is very unique to the market.I think Tru, in terms of the scale of opportunity, and the cost of entry. And how it's disproportionate market share to the competition, in this environment, which is a tougher environment, provide certainly in the U.S. context the biggest opportunity.
Harry Curtis: A quick follow-up, going back to your business transient demand particularly domestically, what do you think, is holding back CEOs at this point. Now that we're looking at least the early innings of a trade deal, eventually, the coronavirus is going to receive from the CNN and Fox headlines? Do you think it's concerned about the election, where we are in the economic cycle? Is there some scenario that you can think of that lifts this business transient demand?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I think, it's a bunch of things. First of all, I'd say, the way those things work is people make budgets in the fall of prior year on, how much they're going to spend in CapEx and how much hiring they're going to do.And it's not that the - and how much travel sort of has a knock-on effect that will occur. And it's not that they never change those, and it's not that travel is their biggest - in the expense category. But it is a line.But they traditionally don't change them quickly, and they certainly don't change it that typically early in the year - very early in the year. So I think to a degree, if you think about when things got budgeted right the things that you described were not resolved, right?You were in the middle of a trade war election uncertainty, global uncertainty generally, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think it takes a little time to sort of work its way through. There are obviously - not to pick on the negatives there are some other uncertainties.We're in an election cycle. And the outcomes are broad. And I think there's some concern about that. And coronavirus as well, our belief is that most of you know the countries around the world, including China are being quite responsible. And it will be managed. It is a risk.And so I think it take sort of the combination of budget seasons where it was greater if things stabilize, but a few other risks. And I think it has made for sort of the business transient growth to be tepid.Now, here's thing and I want to be really clear, that I don't want to get ahead of myself, right, in the sense that, it's early in the year. And it's hard to know. But, I would say, even over the last few weeks, like as I said even over the last few weeks so as I said you here yesterday, getting my weekly update from our - at our executive committee meeting.Over the last two or three weeks, we have started to see in terms of advanced bookings, which are in business transient are all short-term. But real-time, we have finally started to see those come back to life. They were very anemic. And we've now started to see advanced booking growth come back. That's a few weeks of data.Again I don't - I want to emphasize that, but that might be a consequence, again on a lag effect people starting to settle down a bit. I think when you look at the segments for the year, Harry and others I mean, I think we still would believe as I said in my prepared comments that given where group position is and given the strength of the consumer that those will lead the charge and be above business transient. But we do think all segments it will be at a low rate, but all segments will grow. And we have a little - we're hopeful that business transient we're seeing some early signs and we are hopeful that those are sustained.
Harry Curtis: It’s always insightful. Thanks.
Operator: The next question we’ll move back to Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: I was going to ask you Chris about how you view U.S. corporate transient, but I think you just answered there, but I did hear you that you would expect that to post some positive growth in 2020?
Christopher Nassetta: We would yes, modest. And then again hopeful that we're at the beginning stages a little bit more pickup. But I don't want to get ahead of myself and we'll obviously update you as the year goes on.
Joe Greff: Yes. I appreciate that. And then when you look at last year, what percentage of your new signings were hotels in China?
Christopher Nassetta: I would - that's a good question. I would say 20 - in the 20s.
Kevin Jacobs: High teens.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes.
Joe Greff: And I know Hilton back in the SARS days was a different company with different management running it. When you go back and maybe look at SARS as maybe some sort of a case study and this is more from the development side, did you - to the extent you've done this was the rebound in signs coterminous with the rebound in operating demand trends? Or was there some sort of lead or lag one versus the other?
Christopher Nassetta: It was pretty consistent. Again different world, different time. China was an entirely different sort of marketplace. But they all coincident at the same time started to recover and they recovered reasonably rapidly.
Operator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to ask you two quick questions. The first is when you look at the gap in Tru and Hampton about $15, but we continue to see outsized growth in Tru and kind of flattish for Hampton. And how much compression do you think between those brands you will see? And does it have longer term ramifications for Hampton in owners? Is there cannibalization going on? Or are there other factors that’s driving the different…?
Christopher Nassetta: I mean, I'm sure there's a market where you could find an owner that would say, we're competing - they're competing with - between Tru and Hampton. But when we look at the aggregate data and we literally look at every market because Tru is not so big that we can. I don't think we're seeing any cannibalization.The price point between them is still 15% to 20% when you look at it. When you look at the growth rate, what's happening is you have Hampton that is a very high market share. It's just at a point where it's very - you're talking about 120. And Tru is performing unbelievably well, but it's still ramping up. I mean, it only has 113 hotels. It's a very new brand. And while it's way outperforming the competition, it is not performing at that level. And so that's what's going on. There's still a good spread. We think there will continue to be a good spread.These are attracting some similar customers, but the bulk of the customers that are being attracted are as intended that those that want a little bit bigger room and are willing to pay a little bit more are back - are in Hampton and a little - pay a little bit less, a little bit smaller room and a different sort of design that sort of are headed to the Tru.So we look at it super carefully, because keeping these 18 brands in their swim lanes is a very important thing. And as I said, you're never going to be able to argue that they don't occasionally compete, because to a degree they all do around the edges, but they have to perform sort of in their main swim lane and ultimately attract demand from that mean swim lane and we're obsessive about looking at that. We think Tru and Hampton are both doing great.Hampton is still the best hotel brand in the world. I think if you look at it by market share growth in units, customer satisfaction, owner returns and satisfaction, it's still the best brand in the world. Tru is going to do incredibly well at a lower price point and I think eventually be equivalent in terms of its strength, but it's something different.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thanks. And I just -
Kevin Jacobs: Smedes, I'd just add Chris alluded to this, but the difference in the sample sizes of the two in terms of just the number of comp hotels and then the percentage in each group of comp hotels that are ramping hotels, it's sort of night and day for those two brands. So just keep that in mind when you look at comp RevPAR growth.
Smedes Rose: And I just wanted to ask you, I mean, obviously there's been a lot of media around whether or not Hilton Grand Vacations has sold. I wanted to ask you to technicality, I guess. If it were sold, does your licensing fee - the fee arrangement transfer automatically? Or is that an opportunity to renegotiate? And maybe sort of broadly what are the parameters of an entity that you would be willing to license those brands to?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. We're not - I'm not going to comment much on that. First, anything related to anything HCV may do or not do, you should talk to them about. As it relates to Hilton, I think it is a matter of public disclosure. When we spun the company, we were incredibly thoughtful about our contractual arrangements, which we think give us all of the things that we need to make sure that we're protecting the two things that we care about, which is our brand and our fee stream. And beyond that I'm not going to comment.
Operator: The next question is from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Two questions. First is on - I'm sorry, if I missed this in the opening remarks, but I don't know if you said your RevPAR index in Q4. And then my other question just on share repo. Your remain authorization looks like sort of less than a quarter's worth of like based on what you've done the last year less than a quarter's worth remaining.And the Board I guess did authorize some things related to the dividend in February, but it looks like they did not authorize any additional share repurchase. And so it looks like you're close to running out. Just wondering how to interpret that. Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes. I don't think we've mentioned fourth quarter. For full year, we said it was up the biggest increase we've seen 140 basis point system might increase for the year. Fourth quarter was relatively flat to slightly up as we expected given the comparability issues and the group positioning in the various quarters throughout the year. So, no surprises there. And again, a full year share gain that's the best that I've seen in my - going on 13 years with the company.
Kevin Jacobs: And Robin I'll take this repurchase one. I think while you are factually correct, and of course any incremental reauthorization would be up to our Board of Directors. But I think you should not read into anything related to timing and you should just think about our capital allocation strategy, as we've articulated it continuing to live on.
Christopher Nassetta: Right. And we gave you guidance for what we're going to do. So I assume that we will live up to the guidance parameters.
Robin Farley: And then just last clarification. I think in your introductory remarks when you were recapping Q4, I think you said that, the calendar hurt by 90 basis points or I just wanted to clarify that because it seems like the month of December got a huge boost from the calendar. And so I didn't know, if that was - just any color about it.
Christopher Nassetta: December is a very small month relative to the other months and the impact of the holidays - and otherwise greatly outweighed the benefit.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Plus day of week shifts throughout the rest of the quarter. So yes, we did say that, it was about a 90 basis point impact on the quarter.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.
Patrick Scholes: Just a follow-up question here or perhaps a point of clarification, when you talked about the possible RevPAR declines due to the virus and the EBITDA that is just mainly in China, correct? And have you thought about what the potential impact might be outside of China such as in other countries in Asia Pacific? And are you seeing any domestic cancellations from domestic travelers who are not Asian bound at this point?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. No, Patrick those estimates are system-wide. So that the - obviously the lion's share of the impact will be felt on the ground in China and in Asia, but those are system-wide estimates. And if you think about overall U.S.-China inbound to the U.S. on an overall system-wide basis is still quite small. It's about 20 basis points. And then China inbound on a system-wide basis outside of China is about 70 basis points. So those estimates do factor for the whole business.
Patrick Scholes: A follow-up question here. Shifting gears, how concerned are you today about owner pushback on dilution issues when you open or add any new hotels that are competitive with your existing Hilton branded products in the same market? Certainly at the ALAS conference talking to owners definitely send some frustration about the proliferation of brands coming in their market?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, it's something when I - when I talked about the process briefly in my prepared comments about how we launched Tempo similar to how we launch every brand, we - our owner community is deeply involved. Like in the Tempo launch, we had an owner committee that worked with us throughout the process for - over the last year. And we're part of the launch and we're super supportive. I can't say that, that we're perfect. Occasionally, we're going to have owners that have issues with it.But back to my earlier comments about Tru - and answering the prior question about Tru and Hampton, we're always incredibly focused on trying to develop brands that we think really are a unique demand base and customer segment that they may around the edges compete, but that they have a demand base that can ultimately drive their success without cannibalizing our existing brands.And so given that, we are obsessive about that given that we involve a broad base of owners with us in the development of these brands, I am not ultimately, particularly worried about it. But we have a lot of brands at 18. We have a lot fewer than some of our competitors.And so - well, I'm not going to say I've never had a discussion with an owner that has had concerns. My honest and objective view is I have not had a lot of pushback from owners, particularly given so many of them are so deeply involved in helping us develop these brands.
Operator: The next question is from Bill Crow with Raymond James.
Bill Crow: The first question on Coronavirus. And Kevin I appreciate the details on the percentage contribution in the U.S. and elsewhere. But certainly every market is different. And I'm just wondering whether you're seeing a bigger impact or a material impact at this point on some of the West Coast markets or New York or say Paris and whether you've started to see any cancellations in Tokyo related to the Olympics?
Christopher Nassetta: So first - well second part is a little bit easier. No we are not seeing any cancellations related to the Olympics, in fact, pre-Olympics activity is gearing up as we speak. And we expect that to be business as usual. Of course, again if something changes in terms of the breadth and the reach of the virus that we would have to update our guidance if things were - if that - things were that bad. So that one's easy.On the second point, you're obviously correct. There are markets that have a higher concentration of Chinese inbound. We're trying to size it for usChinese inbound. We're trying to size it for us. So others that would be more concentrated in those markets might size it differently. But just to give you a little bit more context, I mean on an overall basis, our overall international inbound is about 5% and it only gets up to about 20% in key gateway cities like New York and West Coast cities.And that's all inbound not just China. So China on a relative basis while an important outbound market and one that we've been all working really hard to cultivate is not so impactful that it's going to change the answer beyond what we've said.
Bill Crow: And then my follow-up is on the pipeline. And I think we all understand what's going on with cost inflation and construction in the U.S. and what's going on with labor cost inflation in the U.S. Are you seeing similar trends globally? And I know that's a hard thing to categorize but your major areas of focus. Are you seeing that sort of inflation?
Christopher Nassetta: No. I mean you're right and implied to your question is the world is a big place and it's different sort of story everywhere you go. But I would say that broadly the answer is no. The biggest pressure that we've seen in terms of cost increases on input costs for development have been in the U.S., in terms of our larger markets around the world.Now importantly, those have moderated, they're still - they're not going down but they're still growing. But if you look at the last two to four years, I would say, our view was those input costs were going up in high single-digit, low double-digit. If you look at what we see right now, that's sort of a little bit above inflation. It's sort of like 3% versus 8% to 10%. So again they're going up. RevPARs aren't going up that much. All the pressure that has been implied in a bunch of questions exists, but the pace at which it's going up is less.And again having an industry leading market share across the entire brand portfolio and with each individual brand means that what is getting done is more what we - our brands are more financeable and we're getting an unfair share if you will of that development activity. But this is the market - the U.S. has been, of the big markets the most impacted by that phenomenon.
Operator: The next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: Chris, following up on your earlier comments about seeing some strengthening in bookings over the past few weeks. Is there any way to quantify it? Or maybe qualitatively, does it kind of feel like we're back to the bookings you're seeing when RevPAR in the U.S. is more like 2% versus 1%? Any color would be helpful.
Christopher Nassetta: Thomas, I don't want to be evasive, but I led into that was saying, it's really early a couple of weeks two or three weeks of data. So no. And I can't give you a whole lot more color other than to say it's gone from like flat to wanting to - sort of flat to wanting to be negative to showing positive growth.So I can't gauge it whether it feels like one or two. It's just - it's too early. The good news is like every quarter, we'll be back, we'll report and we'll have a little bit more data to give you and have a better sense of it, because we're just getting into the business transient travel season because that works in the first part of the year January. The first part of January is sort of a wash because nobody wants to travel. So I'd love to give you more. I just don't have more. That's the most sort of color I can give at the moment.
Thomas Allen: And then just on the NUG growth two detailed questions. Just how has attrition or closings tracked, and then any update on time lines of construction? Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: Attrition has been tracking about the same. No difference over the last few years when we look at it. And in terms of delays pre-coronavirus that will obviously likely it will cause some amount of delay which is why we gave the overlay on that. Outside of that, we have not really seen it. I mean, if you look at it over the last five years have we seen things take a little longer to get done a few more months of construction and the like yes. I think the technical base is yes. But in terms of our NUG guidance over the last few years, we've sort of baked all of that into our thinking and continue to. So nothing material that we see there. No big trend on attrition. Steady as it goes.
Operator: And our next question will be from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian: So unit growth and RevPAR guidance for 2020 together is slightly higher than the M&F fee guidance. Would you say that's coming more from license fees or maybe incentive fees with just a lighter RevPAR environment or is there something else that you would call out?
Christopher Nassetta: First of all license fees is included in the fee guidance. So again, it's a little bit of the cost control that I was talking about earlier and nothing more than that Jared.
Jared Shojaian: And then, can you just talk about what's next on the brand introduction front, now that you've announced Tempo? And then I guess related to this idea you've talked about how strong Tru has been, do you think there's any opportunity to introduce anything at a price point even further below where Tru is that right now?
Christopher Nassetta: I'll answer the second first. I don't think so. We're not -- I mean first of all I've been pretty consistent in saying pre-Tempo we were working on two different brands. Tempo was one of them upscale lifestyle. I've also said we have been lightly working on luxury lifestyle. And so at some point, we will launch a luxury lifestyle brand. We're not in a rush to do it honestly.We launched three brands basically last year. We've launched one this year. I want to give them all their proper birth rate and make sure they're really working. 18 brands to the earlier commentary, we think is enough to be able to accomplish what we want to accomplish with our network effect.And so, we're going to take a little bit of a break and get the ones we've got out there working and working really well. And someday, we'll do something in luxury lifestyle and the environment we're in. It's not going to be - in any environment, it's not going to be a gargantuan brand by number of units. And in today's environment the opportunity set is less anyway. So I want our teams focused on we have launched and to get it going.As it relates to Tru, I don't think so. I mean, it took the better part of I'd say seven years in thinking and engineering to launch Tru. And the reason it took so long is, we have a lot of other things going on, but it was like, we were trying to figure out, how do you engineer a cost to build a product, a cost to operate, clean and the like OpEx and CapEx that would deliver a return based on a rate that we would get that would be 15% to 20% lower than Hampton, but still deliver Hampton like returns, which I would say is sort of an unleveraged return on total cost of 11% or 12% at stabilization because, that's where we know you can attract the owner capital to make the magic.And we spent a lot of time doing it. It's hard. The lower the price point, the harder it gets to be able to engineer it in a way where you can get those returns. And importantly, it's really hard to be able to do it sustainably. So the problem, you've got to be able to build it to the cost. You've got to be able to operate efficiently.And you got to be able to renovate it in terms of percentage of revenue that can go towards keeping it up over 20 or 30 years and deliver those returns. And the lower you go in absolute RevPAR or ADR, the harder it gets because the higher percentage you are having to reserve in order to keep these things fresh over a longer period of time. We figured it out in Tru, but it took a lot of work in engineering and its working.I believe going to a price point lower than that, it would be very hard for us or anybody if not impossible. And so, we have -- we are not in any way working on that. And never say never, but I think it's very hard to go much lower in price point and ultimately deliver a product that over a long span of time, the arc of time of 20 and 30 years, these brands that were 100 years old, these brands got to last a long time that you can maintain a brand like we have over 30-plus years with Hampton that still is a category killer because you can force - you have returns that are high enough to force the investment in over time to make sure they stay relevant. So, it's a long-winded way of saying, no. I do not see us doing that.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time today. We covered a lot of territory. Obviously there's some moving parts out there particularly in APAC and with coronavirus. We got to do our best to give you some contours or guardrails to how to think about it. We hope it was helpful. Obviously, as the year plays out, we will keep up with you and give you more information. As I said in my comments, we're super excited about what we accomplished in 2019 and 2020 is off to a great start and we'll talk with you after the first quarter. Thanks again for the time.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-10-23 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning. And welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s third quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.Hilton.com.This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the Company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our third quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions.And with that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our third quarter results continued to improve the strength of our business model as strong net unit growth drove solid bottom line performance.Adjusted EBITDA was towards the higher end of our guidance, while adjusted EPS exceeded our expectations all in spite of softer-than-expected industry RevPAR performance.Additionally, our strong portfolio of brands supported by our powerful commercial engines continued to drive strong market share gains. Year-to-date, we’ve increased our system-wide RevPAR index premium nearly 200 basis points, growing across all brands and all regions.Our performance continues to drive meaningful free cash flow generation. Year-to-date, we have returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. And we’re on track to return $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, or nearly 8% of our market cap for the full year.In the quarter, we grew system-wide RevPAR 40 basis points, which was below our expectations due to softness in US transient and Asia. System-wide group RevPAR increased more than 3% in the quarter boosted by strength in company meetings. However, transient RevPAR was relatively flat across business and leisure following short of expectations, due to weakening macro trends. For the fourth quarter, we expect conditions to remain consistent with these trends.As a result, we now expect full year RevPAR of around 1%. As we look to next year uncertainties in the macro environment make it difficult to forecast. Most indicator suggest continued economic growth for all major global regions, but at a slower pace. As a result, at this point we would expect full year 2020 RevPAR growth to be around flat to 1%.That said, we expect to continue to deliver net unit growth in the 6% to 7% range, which should continue to support solid bottom line performance next year. We will give you more specific guidance on our next call.Our robust development story remains a key driver of our continued success in delivering value beyond the broader fundamentals. Year-to-date, we've opened nearly 330 hotels totaling roughly 47,000 rooms and remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth for the full year. This will mark our fifth consecutive year of net unit growth above 6%.At the end of the third quarter, our pipeline totaled nearly 379,000 rooms with continued growth across both US and international regions. Developer appetite for our brands remain strong and we expect to deliver another year of record signings of over 115,000 rooms and record construction starts of more than 87,000 rooms, which supports our net unit growth outlook for the next several years.In the US, both signings and starts are tracking modestly ahead of our prior expectations with starts now forecast to grow nearly 20% in the US for the full year.Turning to openings. We welcomed our 100th Tru and our 2,500th Hampton, demonstrating continued growth in both new and existing brands. Since launching less than four years ago Tru has established itself as the premier mid scale brand with a RevPAR index of 130, the highest brand premium in the industry.At the other end of the spectrum Hampton is one of our oldest brands, but remains a dominant player in its segment. After 35 years, Hampton still boast an industry-leading RevPAR index of nearly 120 and a pipeline of more than 700 hotels.Earlier this year, we announced that we are on track to open more luxury properties in 2019 than any year in our history. In the third quarter, these additions included the Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal in Mexico, the Conrad Shenyang and the Conrad Tianjin in China, the Biltmore Mayfair, our first LXR property in Europe and the grand reopening of the Conrad New York Midtown following an extensive renovation and conversion from the London.Overall, we think our disciplined and diversified development strategy positions us to capitalize on demand trends around the world throughout all parts of the cycle while maximizing our net fees and driving significant shareholder returns.With over half of our pipeline under construction, we feel good about our ability to continue delivering over 6% net unit growth for the next few years. Our goal to deliver a brand for every traveler for any travel need they may have, anywhere in the world is resonating with our most loyal guests.In the quarter, Hilton Honors members accounted for more than 62% of occupancy increasing 430 basis points year-over-year. Additionally, unique Honors features like connected Room and Digital Key along with our new Expect Better Expect Hilton Marketing campaign starring Anna Kendrick continue to attract new members. Honors enrollments increased 25% year-over-year in the quarter to total nearly 99 million members and we remain on track to hit our 100 million member milestone this week.Our commitment to providing exceptional guest experiences and customer service would not be possible without our nearly 420,000 team members and the strong culture we have built together. I ‘am extremely proud that Hilton has maintained our number two ranking as a world best place - best workplace and was also named the number one Best Workplace for Women in the US.With the support and dedication of our team members, we are able to grow our global footprint and have a positive impact on the communities where we live and work.To sum it up with another quarter of solid bottom line performance we remain confident in our fee based business model and diversified capital-light growth strategy. This combined with our disciplined approach to capital allocation we think it puts us in a great position to continue driving value for our guests, our owners and our shareholders.With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for more details on the results and our outlook for the future.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 0.4% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, as weaker transient demand in the U.S. and slower than expected Chinese leisure travel weighed on results. Despite softer macro trends, we continue to gain market share. Adjusted EBITDA of $605 million increased 9% year-over-year. Outperformance to the mid-point of guidance was primarily driven by greater cost control.In the quarter, management franchise fees increased 6% to $577 million with strong net unit 0020strong and license fees offsetting softer top line performance. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items grew 13% to $1.05 exceeding the high end of our guidance.Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Third quarter comparable US RevPAR grew 0.4%, as solid market share gains and good group business were offset by soft transient trends. For full year 2019, we forecast US RevPAR growth in line with our system-wide guidance based on modestly softer macro trends.In the Americas outside the US, third quarter RevPAR declined modestly versus the prior year largely due to hurricane-related weakness across the Caribbean. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be in the low single-digits.RevPAR in Europe grew 2.4% in the quarter driven by increased demand across London, which benefited from a good city-wide calendar and strong international inbound trends. Results were further boosted by solid convention and trade show business across Turkey and Spain. We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be in the low single-digits given favorable trends across Continental Europe, modestly offset by continued Brexit uncertainty.In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was slightly negative in the quarter. Similar to trends we've seen throughout the year, supply growth in the UAE continued to pressure rate growth. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be down in the low single digits.In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR fell 2.7% in the quarter, as trade tensions intensified and protest in Hong Kong further weighed on leisure travel. As a result, RevPAR in China fell 5.6% in the quarter.For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be flat to slightly down with RevPAR in China declining in the low single-digits, reflecting a continuation of current trends.Moving to our guidance. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of around 1% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.285 billion to $2.305 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of roughly 9% at the mid-point. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items of $3.81 to $3.86.For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be growth to be roughly flat. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $563 million to $583 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.91 to $0.96. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases.Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter for a total of $43 million in dividends year-to-date. Our Board - sorry $43 million in dividends in the quarter. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash quarter.Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For 2019, we expect to return between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details of our third quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning so we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Chad, can we please have our first question?
Operator: Sure. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry Curtis: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Harry.
Harry Curtis: Yes. Good morning. A quick question on your pipeline, which again was up sequentially, as well as year-over-year despite what looks to be relatively flat corporate travel budgets.But developers still have a strong appetite to invest even in this decelerating economy, what do you think the disconnect is, and maybe you can speak to the – maybe the uniqueness of the Hilton brands or – but at the end of the day do you expect it to continue?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. I think it's a good question. And I think the short answer is we do expect it to continue at least for the time being. I think what’s going on with the developers in every region of the world is a little bit different story. But I think broadly, most of the folks that we're working with particularly in the US.This is their business. They are, if you look at it largely a very diversified group of owner operators. A large part of it again, particularly in the U.S. is franchise-based. And they are as we are and everybody that's running a business trying to grow - ultimately grow their business both on the ownership and on the operating side. And what they're doing is looking for unique opportunities in particular markets and then in particular locations within those markets with the right brands, where they still believe even with higher construction costs higher labor costs, et cetera that they can drive – they can both finance and then drive ultimately returns on their equity that makes sense.And so what we are seeing. I mean, testament to that is the number I gave you that we expect starts in the US to go up 20% this year, what we’re seeing is for the right increase US to go up 20% in the U.S. to go up 20% in the U.S. to go up 20% in the U.S. to go up 20% this year.What we are seeing is for the right projects in the right markets in the right locations, with good developers they are getting things done. And we're talking about our brands. We are disproportionately a beneficiary of that that, because our individual brands either are category killers in terms of market share or they sort of lead or – co=lead the pack on average, we have the highest market share in the business. And there is not one brand in the bunch that is not performing at a very high level from a market share point of view.And so that is the basic desire of developers to continue to grow their businesses in a selective way combined with our having the best highest-performing brands in the business, which is just I think objectively and factually true is allowing us to continue to take a disproportionate share of development opportunity out there.If you look at the inputs and it is a bit surprising frankly, I would say based on my expectations coming into the year which are always – we’re pushing our teams. That's our job. We are outperforming a bit even my expectations. I think when we finish the year, we think in terms of new deal signings I mentioned in my comments over 115,000 rooms, we think we will probably do a bit better than that. It will be the highest level of approvals, deal signings that we'll have had in our history. That's about up close to 10% year-over-year.So while yes, the macro environment is more challenging. We are performing really well in that regard. Construction starts which obviously is the next step. If you want to deliver you got to build them. You know, we think when the year's out we'll be up circa 5%. 20% in the US, but overall throughout the world 5-plus percent.So those I think are all very good leading indicators. Frankly, as I said in my prepared comments of what the next few years will bring, you heard that we are cautious as I think everybody is about the same-store growth environment because macro conditions have weakened. There's just no debating that and that's why we're, sort of, giving I would say reasonably cautious guidance on a same-store basis.But the beautiful thing about this model which is really being driven by what we're talking about pipeline, rooms under construction and ultimately net unit growth is that even in this environment, we will be able to deliver great bottom-line results, you know, even in a modest almost flattish RevPAR environment in the third quarter you saw we drove EBITDA growth of 9% - with sort of one-ish for the year. We’re going to grow for the full year EBITDA at 9% EPS at 13% -- 13-plus percent, while we didn't give guidance for next year -- with what's being signed, what's going under construction and what we think we will deliver in the 6% to 7% range, we will deliver even in the face of reasonably weak macro conditions, we will deliver another great year, which I think is again a testament to in a post-spin world - the strength of the business model. And if we do our jobs, we will keep those inputs that we're talking about signing more deals and rooms under construction moving in the right direction.
Harry Curtis: If I can ask just a quick follow-up that's related, are you seeing any change in the requirement by lenders for more equity?
Christopher Nassetta: I would say we study that pretty scientific. I would say after a - what has been a tightening trend meaning less money - a little bit tougher terms all around in the lending environment, we have seen that flatten out.So I would say quarter-over-quarter over the last couple of quarters, I mean, it got harder over the last year or – a year or two. But at this point it is relatively stable.
Harry Curtis: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.
Christopher Nassetta: And construction costs by the way this year do after growing at high-single-digit, low-double-digit rates. Our best sense in what we’re seeing is that that has been tempered as well that construction costs are going to be growing in the low to – they’re still growing, but in the low to mid-single digits versus high single-digit low-double-digit, which is helpful to a degree.
Harry Curtis: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Good morning. Guys, as we think about kind of the unit growth and the RevPAR growth for next year, clearly the under construction pipeline is roughly where it was last year, a little bit above where it was last year at this time. So that should bode well for kind of next year's NUG number. Obviously the RevPAR guidance a little bit more tempered.When we think about though the level of performance from some of the other fees and whatnot that go into kind of 2020 relative to what you got this year from things like the credit card, et cetera.Do we think 2020 looks like more of a year where it's NUG plus RevPAR kind of gets us to your expectations for fees? Or is there still some slack in there that would allow you to continue to outperform like you have year-to-date thus far?
Christopher Nassetta: Carlo, I think it’s more the former than the latter. I mean we do believe - we had a big ramp-up in growth rate as we had the new deal with AMX sort of come into play. That is now ramping down.I do believe it will grow in the next several years at somewhat above algorithm growth if you will, but not materially so. So that it really is going to create as you called it sort of incremental slack. I think the way to think about next year is simple algorithm kind of growth.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up. Obviously, where you are right now from a leverage perspective a little bit below where you've been. Obviously the capital returns are implied to be up a little bit from where you'd previously guided the range to be for this year. How are you thinking about the current leverage? And as you look out to 2020 with respect to the balance sheet and capital returns?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, Carlo. It's Kevin. We think about all of that in the same way that we've been thinking about it. So I think the way you should thinking about it is you've heard us say this before but sort of high level.You should think about the entirety of our recurring free cash flow plus whatever proceeds we get from releveraging the business should drive the capital return. We're still comfortable with our 3 to 3.5 times range and would be targeting the midpoint. I think what you're seeing this quarter is we did finish a tick lower than the midpoint, and that's really related to the recent Odawara sale and that cash still being on the balance sheet, and a little bit of timing.If we achieve the midpoint of our -- midpoint or slightly better of our capital return guidance for the year, we'll be right about in the middle of the range. So, nothing new there.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you guys.
Kevin Jacobs: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning, guys.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff: Can you break out 3Q performance between business transient and leisure transient? I know you kind of bucket them together when you’re going through Q3 highlights?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. They were pretty comparable. They were both flat. I don't have it in my head. But both basically flat. One was plus. I think business transient was up a tick and leisure transient was down a tick. Recognizing part of the leisure transient thing a small part it was weaker. I'm not trying to candy quote that.There was also a leisure transient comp that was more difficult this year over last year. On the business transient, it was anemic. I mean, it was positive, but anemic. And that was just -- I'd love to have a more sophisticated answer, but I think it just had to do with broader weakness.We did see just a little bit of color like if we - if I you look at business transient, you break it down by segments small business, medium and big businesses. We saw more impact in larger businesses, which - I mean we have a theory on that. I mean they're sort of more tied in - most of them are public.They're more tied in to what's going on real-time in the marketplace and maybe reacting to the uncertainty that is out there a little bit more rapidly than small or medium-sized businesses.That's the theory. But we -- when we parsed it, we did see more impact in large accounts, but it was -- basically the way to look at both of them as they sort of round to flat. One's up a little one's down a little.
Joe Greff: Great. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up to that, can you just talk about your exposure to top 25 US markets, what percentage of your fees are tied to these markets, what percentage of maybe thinking about it this way your anticipated 2020 openings are in these markets and obviously look at the STR data of late? That's where you've seen a big level of decel. And that's all for me. Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: Yes, happy to do that. We have about in the U.S. about 35%, 38% of our existing supplies in the top 25 markets, a little bit less than that in - from a pipeline point of view. And those markets while our top 25 has been outperforming the STR data, they have been modestly underperforming the non-top 25.So we would see some impact from that. I think if you look across the industry, we are - we do not stand out on the heavy side of that, let’s just say.
Joe Greff: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, maybe just follow-up on just the broader environment. As people start to kind of think about the zero to one outlook and just the overall kind of puts and takes about 2020.Can you just help us think about when you're talking to other either large corporations on the customer side or other kind of fellow CEOs, what are some of the things that might differentiate between high and low in your range?And more importantly, like just any green shoots or things you could see that might be a little bit more on the optimistic side as you’re kind of thinking about 2020? Just trying to kind of frame up, how much of this is an extrapolation of current trend versus what could be different having this conversation a year from today?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. It’s a good question and deserves a good answer, but I'm not sure if I have one, I mean, but I'll give you one. I mean, kidding aside, I talked to a lot of customers and – I'm doing that all the time. And I would say, none of this will surprise you. I mean what I think the sentiment is broadly is probably a sentiment of everybody on this call. Certainly, the sentiment of everybody in this room which is there are a lot of uncertainties in the world and markets don't like uncertainties. Businesses don't like uncertainties when they are trying to make decisions on hiring more people, investing in plant equipment technology, making bigger decisions that drive investment, that drive demand for hotel rooms.In this kind of environment, I’ve sort of have described that maybe on the last call they're caution flags out. I think everybody's reading the papers, watching what’s going on with Brexit, watching what's going on with the trade wars, not only in the US and China, but Korea and Japan, looking at broader economic issues, an election year coming up in the U.S. and impeachment process going on.And when you - I think when you add all of that up - again I'm being a master of the obvious here. When you add all of that up, it's creating a level of uncertainties that I think has got people rattled. And I think what is that, what you're seeing in the results is, the, caution flags are out, people are doing fewer things. I think you'll see it ultimately in hiring numbers. You'll see it certainly in investment numbers. And it is showing up.And we’re a decent sort of lead indicator, on some of on some of the shorter-term transient trends that, they're just its still - they're still travelling. They are still doing things, but maybe it's not as robust as it would otherwise be.So it's sort of the - what would lead to things feeling a little bit better to your question of like how do you get to the high end, it’s settling some of those things down. I mean you're going to have an election that will have -- but that's not going to happen until late in the year.But trade deals getting done, Brexit getting resolved, just one way or another not -impeachment resolution. I mean, any of these I think or a number of them together getting resolved, certainly in my opinion and that is all it is, could give you a boost. It could sort of released a different level of decision-making, and people being willing to invest more hire more and thus have to and want to travel more. But think you need to see, some or a number of these things, sort of settle down, and people to pull the caution flag in a little bit.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: Next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hi. Thanks. Two follow-ups, I guess first, how should we think about the opportunity and timing to start pushing some of the new brands overseas? And then second, how are existing owners', financials or leverage levels, similar or different to prior cycles?
Christopher Nassetta: Maybe I’ll take the second one first. I think broadly, people's leverage levels are lower. I mean as compared to going into the great recession I would say, well debt is fairly available - abundantly available. It is not as crazy available as it was then. So my sense certainly within our system is people are much more sensibly levered, as we look at the possibility of a slower growth period of time.In terms of distributing our brands around the world that is something that's always ongoing. There's a long answer. The short one - I'll try and give you the short one which is, we are constantly looking at the market opportunities based on demand patterns around the world. We are constantly looking at, whether we should be creating demand and introducing various brand concepts around the world that may not even exist in certain markets, like extended stay in China as an example.And so, you should assume yes, that part of our program is not only continuing to grow the brands that we have, adding incrementally to that brand portfolio over time, but how we distribute those strategically is front and center in our mind and something we spend a lot of time thinking about.And you will continue to see incremental brand introductions in the parts of the world. Tapestry in Europe, for example, you will see and you will likely see extended stay entering China in the next 12 months and a whole bunch of other examples around the world of us doing that.And when you look at it, people think about like NUG [ph] and the future of growth. We are really in our infancy in our international growth both in terms of just while we're big and we've been doing it a long time, if you really look at our footprint in the world, there's gargantuan opportunity.But also in most regions of the world even where we're fully distributed or more fully distributed and we've been there a long time. We may have seven to nine brands of our 17 brands. So not only do we have opportunity to grow those brands, but we have the opportunity to sort of double down and add over time and in a sensible way a number of incremental brands in every region of the world.So it’s a very strategic thoughtful process of how we go about planting these new flags out there to make sure that we always are doing it in a way that we can support it commercially, because we got to drive returns for owners, which is what makes them come back to want us build more hotels for us. But yes, you should assume we will continue to propagate new brands in all regions of the world in a very systematic sort of strategic way.
Stephen Grambling: Helpful. I’ll turn back to the queue. Thanks so much.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question is from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Go ahead, Thomas, perhaps your line is muted on your end. All right. We’ll move to our next question which will be Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is I wanted to circle back to your comments on transient leisure because I think it's the first time that you've talked about that being soft or not being up. And I know that Q3 had that tougher comp in last year's Q3.But can you give us any insight into sort of how Q4 is looking with two-thirds of visibility on the quarter? Just trying to think about how much of it was the tough comp versus actually an underlying trend.And I know you talked a lot about a bunch of the macro uncertainties out there. I don't know if those comments were more about the business transient issue or do you think that's - are those the same issues for leisure transient? Just trying to think about whether this is a trend or a tough comp? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: I think - if I'm being honest, I think it's somewhat of a tough comp, but more of a trend. I think our expectation is that fourth quarter will be tough as well. Now the comps aren't as much an issue, but just the broader trends are weaker.If you look at the retail numbers that were coming out before September, they sort of suggested strength, but September retail numbers were quite weak and I think reflective of what we’re seeing in some of the leisure trends.Again, I think to the extent we get some of the uncertainties out of the air, I think you have plenty of opportunity for consumer confidence, which is still reasonably - not as high as it's been still reasonably high to drive some reasonable growth in leisure transient.But our expectation - our sort of running assumption right now is under current conditions both leisure and business transient will be weaker. We think they'll be positive generally, but they will be reasonably weak.
Robin Farley: Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then if I could just follow up a question about licensing fees which I think Kevin had highlighted, why you were still able to make your guided range for fee growth even though RevPAR was a little bit below the range.How should we think about that going forward licensing fees? It seems like that can be one-offs or not necessarily as predictable. I guess I don't know if there's any color you can give us to how to think about licensing fees going forward.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. Sure Robin. I'm happy to try. I think - I mean overall, I think the message is very similar to before. It actually – its actually - we are lapping over much stronger comps last year as the program was ramping up. And so that's clearly a trend that's going to continue.License fees actually didn't - were in line with our expectations this quarter and we’re not one of the reasons why we made our fee growth this quarter. We did have some other non RevPAR driven fees that did a little bit better, but license fees was not an outsized sort of impact on the quarter.And so - and that'll continue into the fourth quarter which is why you're seeing some of the fee growth guidance for the fourth quarter be a little bit lower because we're lapping over I think 14% fee growth in the fourth quarter of last year.So overall the program is doing fine by the way – you know acquisitions - I'll sort of more focus on the full year because it can be lumpy quarter-over-quarter, but we think Card acquisition is going to be up about 25% for the year spend in the mid to high teens for the year. So the program is going just fine and you're just seeing that we're lapping over really tough comps from last year.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. And I would say - the only thing I'd add to that is, it actually is quite stable. I mean the only thing that's going on is, you're sort of lapping these big ramp-up years of a new program.So the growth rate is coming down just because of the arithmetic, but the programs as it stabilizes is actually quite stable in terms of our expectations of contribution to growth in the next bunch of years.
Robin Farley: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Good morning. Hey Chris. You brought up the election and the political uncertainty. And I think, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that next year we could be dealing with a higher tax environment and potentially a backlash against share repurchases.So I'm just trying to think about how your capital allocation decisions may change in that sort of environment, whether you might be more open to external growth in a low-interest rate - lower share repurchase environment?
Christopher Nassetta: Interesting and good question Bill. It's hard to know what's going to happen next year. Having said that, we feel strongly about our capital allocation strategy and buybacks have been around for time and eternity. And while, I know there’s been things written about it in the political -- with all the political swirl, I personally would bet a whole lot of money against them creating legislation that would restrict buybacks. I don’t believe it makes any sense. Everything I've read about the arguments for it, make no sense.And so I'm not - I don't really have an answer. If that were to change obviously we'd have to think about it, I don't think it. I ultimately don’t think it will. And I think our strategy on how we want to return free cash flow that we don't need to grow the business to shareholders in the form of a modest dividend but a lot of buybacks over time is the right strategy. We’re going to stick with it. If the law prohibits, it obviously we wouldn't.But again, I would doubt that that would happen. And I think over the next 5, 10, 15, 20 years if you run the models the result - the best result we can deliver is going to be as a result of that capital allocation strategy.
Bill Crow: Great. I will leave it there. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Thanks. And I just wanted to follow-up on the capital return question. In the past you sort of indicated that you think you could continue to repurchase and pay dividends along - in the sort of same range of what you've done this year. Anything about today's guidance or your RevPAR outlook changed that for you at this point?
Christopher Nassetta: No. It doesn't. I mean, Kevin said it, but I'll say, it again, because it bears repeating. He did a perfectly fine job doing it. But I know, this is front and center on everybody's mind. I mean, the way you think about our - in an oversimplified way how we think about our capital allocation program is that every year we're going to produce a certain amount of free cash flow, okay, and we've got to do something with it. We also have the opportunity to lever and we can lever within the ranges that we've talked about. We could lever beyond that, okay?So the way I would think about it is in sort of three increments. The first is what are we going to do with our free cash flow? But we've said, and I will say again is we're going to pay a modest dividend. We don't have any intention to increase it from its current levels and use all the rest of it to do buybacks.We’ve also been pretty consistent in saying, and I would say again that within the leverage levels of 3 to 3.5 so assume midpoint 3.25 on a regular basis will be relevering because the business can handle that leverage easily. We want to be in the market. We want to be returning capital.We think sort of in that range makes sense. If the business could in circumstances certainly handle more leverage, and we would consider more leverage than the 3 to 3.5, but that would be really as part of market dislocation.And that market dislocation is nobody like – we'll know when we see it. It would be looking at valuation metrics that are sort of below long-term averages would be sort of a leading indicator that there maybe an opportunity.And so at the moment, okay, we have and will continue to implement both stage 1 and stage two, all our free cash flow and a relevering to sort of a roughly midpoint of our targeted leverage levels. Stage three, we are more than willing to consider at the right moment. We just don't view that moment as now.
Smedes Rose: Thank you. I just want to ask you too, if you mentioned China was down 5.6% in the quarter. Is there anyway you can break out how much of that was just kind of Hong Kong-driven with what’s going on in that market versus overall kind of weakness in leisure that you've talked about on prior calls?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah, I can. Hong Kong obviously had a tough quarter. Hong Kong was down 40% for us. And that means if you did the math, Mainland China was down a little less than 3%. If you look at the full year, what we think we will deliver in Hong Kong is obviously still sort of in play.We think Greater China will be down as Kevin, I think said, sort of low single digits, so call it 3%. Mainland China we think will be flat to down a point something like that and Hong Kong down 23%, 25% something like that.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony Powell: Hi, good morning. You talked a lot about transient in the third quarter. How did group bookings before the period look in the quarter? And how does the pace for next year impact your guidance?
Christopher Nassetta: Group pace has been fine not - I would say, not robust, and week-by-week and month-by-month it's been -- definitely been choppy. Some of that has to do with the commission change. We're lapping over periods where we went from a 10% to a 7% commission. And so it creates - it created some - behavior last year which creates comparability issues for this year. But I would say pace has been generally okay, not great.As we look at position for next year, I would say, we feel reasonably good about it not as good as we would have felt at this time last year. So if you look at system-wide numbers we're up in kind of the low single-digits. If you compare that to last year this time by comparison we were up in the mid single-digits. So we're up like 2%. Last year we were up like 5%.Now we've given guidance for the year of 0 to 1 being up 2% in group position going into the year makes us feel good meaning, we've sort of -- we had a much higher level of expectation this time last year based in part upon that group position of what we would deliver in RevPAR.Obviously, we have a different view for next year. And we think the group position is up and is supportive of the overall RevPAR guidance that we've given for the year.
Anthony Powell: Thanks. And maybe just one more. We saw a Waldorf project in San Francisco delayed due to the owners liquidity challenges. How much of your pipeline is in the luxury segment? And can some of those projects be at risk if the slowdown and the overall environment continues?
Christopher Nassetta: Yes it's a de minimis amount. It's 1% one in change. So we've known San Francisco about San Francisco. I know it got -- they became public this week. We've known about that for the better part of the year. But it's a relatively or a very small part of our overall pipeline.And the projects that are most important to us in that pipeline not that San Francis is not but San Francisco has been -- had challenges for a long time. Projects that are really important in that pipeline are -- many of them are under construction and we have every expectation they'll be delivered.
Anthony Powell: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Good morning, Chris and Kevin.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes: Good morning. You’ve given some color on group expectations as well as softness in the business traveler. Wondering what you're seeing right now as far as trends in specifically leisure travel. And what are your -- what are you thinking about next year for leisure? Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: Happy, but I think we already covered it. I mean leisure trends in the third quarter just to recap were flat to slightly down. Part of that was lapping over tougher comps for leisure transient in 2018. Part of that was just a – just weaker transient business like the retail numbers were down -- starting in September. We're seeing some of that.Our expectation is that we'll have more of the same going into the fourth quarter and built into our assumptions for flat to plus one is an expectation of positive but reasonably anemic transient growth in both the business and the leisure side. What -- I was asked the question earlier what could change that?Obviously any one of the things that are going on in the world that is rattling the markets and rattling business in terms of uncertainty any or all of those or if any number of those getting resolved could be helpful. But hope is not a strategy. So what we've tried to do both for quarter and next year is give you a sense of what we think, sort of based on current conditions, which have been weaker.And again, I said in my earlier comments, we still expect to have not only deliver 9% EBITDA growth and 13% EPS growth this year and while we're not going to give guidance, given that unit growth, fee growth et cetera. We expect to have another very good this year and next year even in the face of what we think will be quite anaemic same-store growth.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be from David Katz of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to just ask something because it's come up, a number of times over the past few months. And it may sound as though I'm headed in a negative direction, but that's not the case. So I think the rest of your business model is so crystal clear, with that little preamble.I wanted to ask about the owned and leased portion of the P&L. Because, what we try and do sometimes is figure out where the leverage to the upside and the downside is within that line item.Can you just talk about the expense base or how -- help us think about how the leverage within that owned up and down actually works?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. David, I'd say, it generally works the way. You're used to it working, because you've been covering real estate companies for a really long time, right? So, these are hotels that are sort of behaved like owned hotels.At the GOP margin level it's about 30%. And then they have rent payments, because most of them are released. And so the margins end up being a little bit lower which adds a touch of operating leverage.But the reality is the expense base in those hotels is growing about the way it's growing, in the broader real estate world where half the expense model is labor and labor costs are going up, so call it 3.5%, 4% around the world.Inflation is growing up -- going up kind of 1.5%, 2% around the world. And so our expense base is growing. And at these levels of RevPAR, it's hard to increase the profitability of the hotels.That said the segment is getting smaller over time. It's less than 10% of our overall EBITDA. We are transitioning out of a lot of the smaller less strategic leases. I think we're going to transition out of four leases this year, plus one owned hotel in Odawara that we're selling.And so, that part of the business is getting a little bit smaller. The rest of the business is growing at a 6% to 7% clip. And so over time what you're going to see is, within a reasonable amount of time, you're going to see that segment be 5% of the business overall. And the revenue expense dynamics are going to work the same. It's just going to affect the overall answer even less.
David Katz: Got it. Perfect. Thank you very much.
Christopher Nassetta: Sure.
Operator: The next question is from Jared Shojaian with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian: Hi. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The G&A, guidance came down a little for the year, at the high end. How much flex do you think you have on the G&A side if RevPAR continues to weaken? And any color you can share on how you're thinking about 2020 right now?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. Jared, we can continue to do better. We try to be as efficient as we can. I mean some of it is coming down within the range. And it got a bit lower because as we've seen RevPAR coming down, we've just done better.Now we're going -- now we have a certain amount of expenses in the business and can we do enough there, that it's sort of going to overcome 2%, RevPAR going to 1% if it goes to zero? Not really but you should expect that we can continue to do better. And we've consistently over a number of years now grown G&A at a rate that's less than inflation overall and I think we continue to do that.
Jared Shojaian: Great. Thank you. And one more quick one if I may. Chris, I think I heard you say you're feeling good about your ability to deliver over 6% net unit growth over the next several years. What kind of risks are there if the environment softens from here? I guess, what would cause you to be below 6% beyond next year?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, the risk is you go into another great another great recession sort of or material recessionary environment, but I feel good about it because the inputs are largely in place. So even if you go into a much slower environment than we're experiencing today. These hotels that are under construction which is over half the pipeline are almost all going to get completed number one. The only other input is conversion, and what I would agree is in a weaker environment that actually stimulates more activity conversions not less.So for the few hotels that might fall out that maybe under construction and for some reason don't complete and that is very rare if that happened, I would bet that we would more than compensate for it, with incremental conversion. So that's why, I didn't lightly say, I feel good about our ability to continue for the next few years to drive over 6% -- 6% net unit growth, because I think the inputs are largely in place. So, I mean, there's always downside. Our General Counsel will be staring me down, if I didn't say it, but I – but I – we feel – we said, we feel good about it because we do feel – I do feel good about it.
Jared Shojaian: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time today. Obviously a lot going on in the environment, we'll watch the fourth quarter carefully continue to do our part to drive bottom line results. Look forward to summarizing the year in February. And for those Nats fans out therego Nats, we've won last night. Hopefully, good night tonight. And we'll have our first World Series in Washington in history. Anyway thanks everybody. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-07-24 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide, Second Quarter 2019, Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Chad. Welcome to Hilton’s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today.We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K.In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings Press Release and on our website at www.ir.hilton.com.This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks we will be happy to take your questions.And with that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We’re happy to report another quarter of great results. I think that further demonstrates the strength of our business model and the power of our network effect. Solid net unit growth continued to drive strong bottom line performance with adjusted EBITDA and EPS exceeding our expectations.Additionally RevPAR growth outperformed the industry weighted to our chain scales for the sixth consecutive quarter, illustrating that our 17 distinct brands, award winning loyalty program and exceptional customer experience continue to drive robust market share gains.Overall our system-wide RevPAR index increased 230 basis points year-to-date with gains across all regions and all brands. System-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% in the second quarter, largely in line with our expectations as our market share gains offset broader choppiness in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.Transient RevPAR increased 1.6% on steady business trends and good leisure demand, boosted by the Easter holiday shift. As expected, calendar shifts contributed to softer group performance in the quarter.Turning to our outlook, forecast for GDP, non-residential fixed investment and corporate profit growth remain positive, but incrementally a bit lower than previous estimates. Consistent with these trends, we are modestly adjusting our full year RevPAR guidance to 1% to 2%.Overall we expect the second half of the year to be similar to the first half with consistent U.S. RevPAR growth and slightly softer international RevPAR growth. We expect continued healthy group business towards the mid-point to high-end of our system-wide range and steady business and leisure transient towards the mid-point of our range.Even with slightly lower top-line growth forecast, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year given the significant contribution of net unit growth and strength in other areas of the business.Longer term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver growth ahead of the broader industry as we differentiate ourselves within the lodging space. With an efficient capital-light business model and a disciplined strategy, we continue to fulfill our mission to deliver exceptional experiences at every hotel for every guest, every time.Our innovative technology platforms, unique product offering and award winning culture allow us to execute this strategy delivering incremental value to our guests, our owners and our shareholders.The strength of our brand portfolio continues to drive owner profitability and therefore greater owner interest. Of the more than 450 hotels we opened in 2018, roughly 75% have already reached a RevPAR index of 100 or greater, with those hotels reaching fair market share within just four months of opening on average.For the full year we remain on track for record signings, construction starts and openings. Forecasted signings of more than 110,000 rooms in 2019 would mark our ninth consecutive year of record signings. This supports continued growth in our development pipeline, which we expect to increase in the low to mid-single digits for the full year. Our current pipeline totals approximately 373,000 rooms or over 40% of our existing base.Given the strength of our system, we continue to deliver solid growth with deminimus use of our capital. More than 90% of our deals do not require any capital from us, which drives higher net fees. Year-to-date we’ve added more than 200 hotels, totaling 29,000 rooms to our system and continue to expect to deliver 6.5% net unit growth for the full year.Overall we believe the greatest development opportunity lies in the mid-market, given the strong secular trends globally driven by an emerging middle-class. We think we are very well positioned to continue delivering impressive growth in the focus service segment given our industry leading RevPAR index premiums.During 2019 we expect to celebrate the opening of our 100th Tru hotel, our 500th Homewood Suites, our 850th Hilton Garden Inn, and our 2500th Hampton, demonstrating continued strength across both new and legacy brands.Additionally, our New Hilton Garden Inn prototype designed to better meet the needs of our Chinese guests and owners is gaining great momentum and further feeling growth in Asia Pacific.We also continue to see impressive momentum in luxury as we execute on an exciting development strategy for the segment. With forecasts to grow our luxury portfolio by over 15% this year, we’re on track to deliver more luxury properties in 2019 than any previous year in our 100 year history.Year-to-date we’ve opened four properties, including the highly anticipated Waldorf Astoria Maldives earlier this month. Additionally the Waldorf Astoria Dubai Financial Center opened its stores just a few weeks ago, joining three other Waldorf properties opened in the Middle East with an additional three in the pipeline.In the quarter we made several exciting announcements that will continue to further development growth, including the signing of our first Tapestry in the Caribbean, our first Canopy in Africa and the Waldorf Astoria Los Cabos Pedregal in Mexico, which we expect to open later this year.We were also thrilled to reopen the historic Caribe Hilton in Puerto Rico, following extensive renovations after damage from hurricane Maria. The breadth of our development strategy spanning all regions and brand segments should position us to drive net unit growth for many years to come.With rooms under construction accounting for more than half of our total pipeline, we have solid visibility into our growth over the next few years, and with favorable secular trends continued strength in signing and conversions, and no significant brand repositioning, we feel very good about our net unit growth over the long term.Our industry leading portfolio is anchored by our award winning Hilton Honors program. An integral part of the overall value proposition to guests, Honors occupancy increased nearly 500 basis points in the quarter to 63%. We now have more than 94 million members, up more than 20% year-over-year with meaningful increases in engagement.Active members account for more than half of our global members. We are also gaining greater share of wallet from our most loyal guests with a number of elite members up 25% year-over-year in the second quarter and those members reaching 100 nights, up nearly 60% versus the same period last year.We’re always looking for ways to better connect with our Honors members and provide increased flexibility and earning and redeeming points. With that in mind, we were thrilled to announce a first of its kind travel and hospitality partnership with rideshare leader Lyft. Members can now earn Honors points when they ride with Lyft and they will have the ability to redeem points in the coming months.Whether it’s our partnerships with leaders such as Lyft, Amazon and Live Nation or on property initiatives like Connected Room, we are continually evolving to enable our members to get the most out of the Honors program.We recently celebrated our 100th Anniversary, which is a milestone few companies achieve, let alone with the momentum that we have. Throughout our history we’ve introduced numerous innovations, pioneered new travel markets and provided a wide range of career opportunities for our team members.We are very proud of all we’ve accomplished over this last century and look forward to continuing to positively influence the world around us in the next century. Overall, with the resilient business model, positive industry growth, a good strategy and a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we think we’re very well positioned for the future.With that, I’m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give us some more details on our results and our outlook.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. In the quarter system-wide RevPAR grew 1.4% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, largely in-line with our expectations. As Chris mentioned, results benefited from market share gains, slightly offset by softer group business and slowing Chinese leisure demand. We estimate calendar shifts tempered system-wide RevPAR growth by roughly 500 basis points.Adjusted EBITDA of $618 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 11% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better than expected license fees and greater cost control. We estimate roughly $10 million of the beat was due to timing items that will reverse in the back half of the year.In the quarter management and franchise fees increased 8% to $591 million, helped by strong net unit growth and other non RevPAR driven fees. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items grew 23% to $1.06 ahead of expectations.Turning to our regional performance and outlook, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1%, driven by increasing market share and solid leisure transient growth, while the Easter shift weighed on group business. For full year 2019 we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in line with our system-wide guidance range, based on positive, but modestly decelerating macro growth.In the Americas outside the U.S. second quarter RevPAR grew 3.3% versus the prior year, largely due to strength across South America, which benefited from particularly robust transient demand in Brazil, despite challenging market conditions. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be 3% to 4%.RevPAR in Europe grew 5% in the quarter, boosted by strong trends across Continental Europe, and increase leisure demand in London, which benefited from the Cricket World Cup and rising international inbound travel due to favorable exchange rates.We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be above the high-end of our system-wide guidance range, given favorable trends across continental Europe, modestly offset by continued uncertainty surrounding Brexit.In the Middle East and Africa region RevPAR was slightly positive in the quarter helped by strong group performance during Ramadan. However supply challenges across the UAE continue to mute leisure transient gains in Egypt, a trend we expect to continue in the back half of the year. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be down in the low single digits.In the Asia Pacific region RevPAR increased 2% in the quarter, with a slight RevPAR decline in China, largely due to softening Chinese leisure travel demand, further pressured by the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be in-line with system-wide guidance, with RevPAR in China relatively flat, reflecting softer performance in the quarter and a potential continuation of trends.Turning to the balance sheet, during the quarter we issued $1 billion of senior notes and used $500 million of the proceeds to partially repay our term loans as part of extending that facility for three additional years to 2026. We also amended our revolving credit facility, up sizing that facility to $1.75 billion and reducing our borrowing rate. These financings lengthened our weighted average maturity by nearly two years at a negligible increase to our weighted average cost of debt.Moving the guidance, for full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 2% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.28 billion to $2.31 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of more than 9% at the mid-point. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $3.78 to $3.85.For the third quarter we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $610 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.98 to $1.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases.Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter for a total of $43 million in dividends. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the third quarter.Year-to-date we have returned $766 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. For 2019 we expect to return between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results and our latest guidance ranges could be found in the Earnings Release we issued earlier this morning.This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question.Chad, can we have our first question please.
Operator: Sure. [Operator Instructions] First question today comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Thanks and good morning. Chris you talk about the ongoing market share gains across segments and it looks like you had particularly strong RevPAR in the high-end brands as well as in some of the new brands. How are you anticipating the gains to translate to the pipeline from here and are there any limitations on the absolute number of sign-ups as you expand? And I guess as a quick follow up, are you seeing any shift in the development interest between existing owners versus new?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, good question and we’re really pleased with the market share gains that we had. I guess you know it would be you know sort of skipping to the end and then I’ll fill it in. It would be hard to be perfectly scientific about translating market share gains into you know impact on pipeline. But rest assured, as you talk to the owner community, what they are trying to do is drive profitability.So the higher that our market share in an absolute sense is, the more that we can drive pipeline growth. And I think you know – so the nuance to that is growth in index is really important, and I think what’s notable about it is that again you know both, in the first quarter, second quarter and year-to-date, the growth in index is across all brands and all regions and importantly as I mentioned a couple quarters ago, we would expect that our international regions will equal or exceed the index in an absolute sense that we have in the U.S., which is a wonderful harbinger of good things to come in terms of incremental growth around the world.So that growth in index you know sort of being across the board regionally and by brand is important, but what's equally important is just the absolute market share and I want to you know sort of pause on that for a moment, because what owners are looking for, obviously they want growth, but what they are looking for when they talk to us or any other brand is what is the market share of the brand, and so they are looking at it in an absolute sense.You know to use the simple example, if you have a great market share growth off of a very low base, that doesn't necessarily translate into higher pipeline. What translates into the best pipeline growth is highest absolute market share with growth off of that, and so what I think we're most proud of and it’s not by happenstance, it's by strategy is that we have 17 brands, those that have been out and are reasonably mature, are either at the top of the heap or a category killer. There is dog in the bunch.So any time we're talking to an owner anywhere in the world about any of our brands, all of the brands are performing at the highest level or above, which is the – you know which is a very good set of facts for our development teams to be talking to owners as we are working to increase the pipeline.So again, I can't say – I don't have an algorithm that says if we grow share 230 bips it will translate into this much incremental pipeline growth, but rest assured it is a – there is a very direct connection and I think the market share trends of growth, but equally are more important, the absolute high level of market share across our brand portfolio is going to allow us we think to continue to build the pipeline, build our rooms under construction and ultimately have industry leading that unit growth, because it will continue to attract more capital, because they will be able to make more profit by investing in better performing brands.
Stephen Grambling: Fair enough and then you had mentioned in your remarks some of the partnerships you've made with the loyalty program. As folks are redeeming or earning points and burning points through some of those, you know should we generally be thinking of those redemptions as being, you know accretive to the system fund and therefore allowing you to reinvest more and kind of drives that Flywheel from a loyalty standpoint, and where are the biggest opportunities I guess from a reinvestment that you see.
Chris Nassetta: Well, I think – I mean there are a couple of things. I think the answer is yes, on the margin most of those partnerships involve not all, but most of them involve the partner like in the case of Lyft buying points you know in order to provide points when people who are riding in Lyft, which means it is creating incremental opportunity for Flywheel and reinvestment.I think the other way and this is really important when you think about our engagement numbers, which are twice what they were off a much larger base. If you go back six or seven years ago, I think consistent with a lot of others in the industry, our engagement numbers of our loyalty members was probably half of what it is, 25%, 30%. We are now over 50%. Why is that?Well there's a whole bunch elements to it, but part of that is getting more engagement out of your high level customers, but let's be honest, you mostly have those people engaged. If they're staying with you 100 or 200 nights a year they are sort of – they are active and they are engaged.What it’s been about is more getting lower level members of Honors engagement while they may not stay as much. They may stay two, three, five night a year and not a 100, that's business right and that's important business and the more that that can be a direct source of business rather than indirect, obviously it adds to our RevPAR premiums and it does so in an incrementally efficient way in terms of distribution costs.So one of the things we’ve been very focused on in addition to hitting the highest level of loyalty, which you heard about some, what I think are pretty astounding statistics of you know incremental engagement at the high level is getting lower level engagement and so when you think about, you know our points and money slider, when you think about our you know, we are the only ones that have done, you know shop with Amazon point, you know opportunities for points pulling Lyft, the things that we are doing, I don't want to get ahead of us with Live Nation in terms of ability to use point in a broader context in terms of music opportunity.Those are not just about Flywheel and selling points and getting more money in the system, those are about getting lower level members you don't accumulate potentially enough points to go to the Maldives for a week to get engaged with us, because here's the thing we know; the more engagement, the more share of wallet we get. The more that people are using their points and doing things with it that get them active in our system, that get them in our app and get them thinking about us, the more they spend with us. Every guest – this can be proven scientifically and so the engagement numbers, you know in part are as good as they are because of a bunch of these partnerships.You will continue to see more of this from us, both for higher level members and lower level members and it will as I said provide a bit of the Flywheel that you're describing, but I think really what it's focused on is getting greater engagement from our customer base and having more direct relationships.
Stephen Grambling: Super helpful color. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from Harry Curtis with Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry Curtis: Hey, good morning everybody. Chris, I wanted to focus on some of the factors affecting 2020. This is kind of like putting your projection hat on. As you talk to fellow CEOs, you know in the last couple of quarters we've talked about their level of spend kind of being put on hold at least temporarily because of trade and to what degree is your guidance at least for the back half of this year and in terms of your expectations for next year affected by that, and not only that, but also the political uncertainty? Do you think that there's any at any of that impacting CEOs willingness to spend today?
Chris Nassetta: Well, answering the second part first, I think the obvious answer is yes. I mean not just you know sort of looking at it scientifically, but you know sort of subjectively you know talking to other CEOs, just talking to friends, anybody you talk to, you know what's going on in the political world which is connected to the trade world which is connected to you know a whole bunch of other things is definitely I think having some impact.I think you know I've said this before, I think it means that more people put a caution flag out. It doesn’t mean that they are not doing things, they are spending, they're not hiring, they're not traveling, it just mean they're a little bit more – they are incrementally more cautious because of what's going on in the broader environment and I think that’s you know absolutely going on.Having said that, again it's a caution flag. I would say what I have not seen is like the red flag, which is like all stop. I think people are still you know quietly sort of reasonably optimistic. I think they are carrying ahead and our expectation for the second half of the year and I'll try and answer your 2020 question, although it's way early and it's super subjective at this point.But you know for the second half of the year I think our view and as we looked at our forecast was more the same. Like there doesn't seem like, I mean maybe the work in China this week will be will be fruitful I suspect sometime this year. My own personal opinion is there will be a trade deal with China that will settle some of those things down, time will tell. Certainly will I think help with our you know business in China, but time will tell. You know but there are other swirling activities with the political, you know theater ramping up with the 2020 election coming.So what we anticipated for the second half of the year honestly is more the same trends. The reason we brought the high end of our guidance down was when we were talking to you a quarter or two quarters ago, honestly comps a bit easier in parts of the world. We thought all things being equal, there was a really good opportunity to see things get a little bit better and when we look at the world right now and sort of trying to do our best to forecast the rest of the year, we look at it and say, no, I think it would be - I think it would be aggressive to say things are going to get better. We think that you know what we try to do in the second half of the year is sort of take the most recent trends and project those out.You know that was a big lead up to your answers to your primary question with is 2020. I sort of think about you know we're way early, what do I know, but I think about 2020 and we have to because we're getting ready to go into budget season and all that fun stuff and start to give guidance to our teams around the world. I would say you know my best intel in talking to lots of CEOs and amongst a lot of folks around the world and our teams is that you know I would project out the current trends in to next year. Now is that going to be what happened? Who knows, right.I mean, I think they could incrementally get a little better, they could incrementally get where – I don’t know. I think it’s way early to judge, but if you, what you are doing, ask me the question today, how would I think about 2020 sitting here today? I would think about 2020 a lot like I think about the second half of this year, because I don't have enough intel to think otherwise.
Harry Curtis: Alright, I’ll leave it at that. Thanks everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Alright.
Operator: The next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone. Chris, maybe I just want to ask sort of a similar question, but direct it more at unit growth. So obviously we saw you know some – a very modest amount of sequential growth in the pipeline this quarter, but I think your overall you know view for the full year remains you know pretty steady for pipeline growth. Just what's the commentary out there from developers you know and have you seen any of this corporate softness specifically impact what you are able to do on the signings, your conversion rate or how quickly people are willing to sign deals, and just what’s the activity level out there and what you're able to do from a unit growth perspective?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, great, great question and I’ll follow on maybe to you know answer a little bit more of Harry's question as well.I mean the short answer is no, we have not seen anywhere in the world at this point sort of a deceleration in the trends and new units in terms of signing, excuse me in fact in terms of starts. We expect both in the U.S. and globally for starts to be up. So our development community, even though if you look at it scientifically, it says the debt markets are tightening a little bit. What our experience would tell us in real time is our developers are getting – financing more easily, they are getting more work done. So none of that caution flags that I described are in the operating environment we see yet in the development environment.Now, depending on what goes on with the economy would stand to reason if, you know if you have a you know protracted period of time where there's a lot of uncertainty, it eventually would seep through. I mean it sort of would be disingenuous to sale right, but we're not seeing it in reality as I said, as our starts are going to be up this year and going to set new records in addition to signings and new unit growth.So give that we’ve got a huge pipeline representing 40% of the base, given that we have a very good track record in delivering conversion and more brands to do that, given that you know the more than half of the pipeline is already under construction, I think you know as I said briefly in my prepared comments, I think we have very good visibility into the next few years and I feel very good about our ability to continue to deliver NUG.Now sort of a follow on to Harry’s comment, which I'd be remiss in not saying and I knew I'd be given the opportunity to do it, so thank you Shaun. You know reality is, even in an environment where you have reasonably low, some might say anemic same store growth 1% to 2%, you know we are growing our EBITDA 9% or 10% right, and why is that? Because the bulk of the growth in the business for us is really new unit growth and other things like license fees and cobrand and those are performing well and we expect those will continue to perform well.So even in a world, you know where we are increasing our guidance, at the same time we took the top and down because the core things that are really driving our growth are performing very well. As I think about next year, its way early to get into it, but you know even in a lower growth same store environment we will do the same thing. I think we will deliver net unit growth comparable to what we are doing this year and we will deliver a comparable kind of result, because the business model is in a post-spin world really is as resilient as we have been saying it is and hopefully quarter-by-quarter as we deliver these results in an environment that has been more choppy and where same store growth has been weaker, but yet we deliver very strong bottom line results that people start to recognize that and understand that that is – that the business is resilient and we run the business well, which we intend to and continue to do that.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Hey, good morning. So on Tru I remember when you announced the brand, at the beginning of 2016 and it's impressive that you are now going to open up your 100th hotel this year. As you do more and more work around new brands, do you think there are any other opportunities that could come to a similar size?
Chris Nassetta: Well, there are definitely other opportunities. We've launched three brands in pretty much the last year. You know we have a couple of things I’ll talk about sort of in the skunk works, one much more advanced than the other.Tru is a mega brand in the sense of – and I've said this many times on this call and when we announced it. I think it'll be our largest brand in the world when it's all said and done. Hampton is today at 2,500 hotels. Reality is Tru is serving a much bigger segment of demand, both here in the U.S. and around the world and while it will take you know decades to get it there and that's the beauty of it. It’s like no investment from us, decades of growth, sort of built in growth, Tru ultimately has the opportunity to be even much bigger than Hampton.So that given its serving largest segment of demand, there are brands, one in particular I'll talk about that I think are mega brands, meaning they are hundreds potentially you know over a long period of time, thousands of hotels, but probably none equivalent to Tru to be perfectly honest, just because it's serving 35%, 40% of all demand and is the biggest segment.There are a couple of things that we are working on, both in the lifestyle space. One which I think you know is a very large scale opportunity on a global basis, which I would say is sort of upscale lifestyle, you know like a – I would describe it as sort of a click above Hilton Garden Inn for you know a more urban or mixed use sort of a you know higher end development opportunity.I do think you know that that brand has a huge amount of potential in terms of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hotels around the world. We have already soft lunched it with our development community, the reception which we would typically do before a public launch. The reception has been spectacular. We will probably hard launch that sometime in the next six months just as we refine the product and service delivery and bring a number of development deal to the table.The other one that we are working on that you know I would say more in the skunk works, less imminent is luxury lifestyle. We’ve talked about it you know for a better part of a decade. We will eventually want and be in that space, but we've been trying to focus on some of these other opportunity that we think as we talked to our customers will drive more engagement, more loyalty and sort of help feed the network effect at a larger scale, but we will eventually get to that.So we are not going to be launching three brands every year to be clear. You know I think in the next year we'll probably do one luxury lifestyle at some point in the next couple of years and I'd be remiss in not making this statement. Given that we are in our early days, propagating the breadth and depth of our brands around the world, you know with the list that we have and the two I said, that would be 19 brands. That is plenty of bandwidth for us to keep growing indefinitely, particularly given that we are just getting started with some of these brands in many destinations around the world.
Thomas Allen: Helpful, thank you. And then just to challenge you a little bit on the U.S. Rev par comment, so if we look at corporate confidence...
Chris Nassetta: Which comment?
Thomas Allen: Just on the consistent, on the outlook of consistent U.S. Rev par growth. I mean corporate confidence keeps on deteriorating. That’s the idea to show that June was the weakest month of Rev par growth we've seen all year. So it feels like Rev par growth in the U.S. is deteriorating when you guys are expecting to be consistent. Can we just reconcile those two things? Like are you seeing stronger group bookings or production or just talk to that a bit. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: I would say two things going on really simply and we'll see whether we are right, but I think they are logical. One, particularly third quarter has a very strong group base. So we were sort of leveraging off of that.The second thing is the comps are easier, right. So part of the reason that we thought it would be better was that the comps were easier in the U.S. for a whole bunch of reasons in the second half of the year, so we sort of wiped that out. So between comps being easier and a very strong Q3 group base with most of it already on the books, we feel like the outcome will be very similar. It may be a tick-off. I mean I'm rounding. It may be at tenth or two-tenths off of what we've delivered year-to-date, but we think it'll be you know in that time zone.
Kevin Jacobs: And Thomas, to June we also swapped the Sunday for a Friday in June this year, which I think has been sort of talked about and people are evaluating the SPR numbers. So if you look at June – you can look at June and see we made a little bit of an out way. [ Cross Talk]
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, and May was really – April was not that great than June, but May was really strong. So yeah, I wouldn't read too much into June. I mean on the other hand we are definitely saying by bringing our guidance down at the top end overall from a same store point of view that we think the world has – and I said it in my comment, the world is incrementally a little bit weaker.So I'm not – we're not debating that with you. We just – as we look at you know forecast in a granular way by property, given the factors that I just described, we think it's going to be similar to what we saw in the U.S. in the first half of the year.It's definitely going to be lower in the international if for no other reason – I mean all – we had a very strong Europe first half of the year, Continental Europe which we still think will be outperforming the rest of the world, but won't be outperforming as much, and then China in particular which is driving APac, Japan also will be, but China is clearly going to be worse in the second half of the year than the first and so international will be on average less in the second half than the first half, we're pretty confident.
Thomas Allen: Really helpful color. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Okay.
Operator: The next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning everybody. One question related to the hotel development, the pipeline. Chris or Kevin, can you give us a sense of maybe what hotel developers are underwriting to in terms of an IRR now say versus a year or two ago. Maybe you can look at it U.S. versus China. And then with respect to signings, to what extent are you getting the increased requests for helping capital to be involved? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, so I don't think people are underwriting you know dramatically different IRRs than they were a year or two ago. I think where people sort of look to change their underwriting is you know what are risk adjusted returns relative to a risk free rate, and the risk free rate has you know moved around a little bit, but hasn't been all that different. So I personally don't think people are under writing to different returns.I think they are adjusting their expectations of what their underwriting is going to be going forward and so you see that a little bit you know in terms of the transaction market for existing assets that affects pricing, but in terms of what people are looking forward to take development risks, that's been really consistent.And then sorry, the second question, key money. Yeah look, I mean I think you've seen the contract acquisition costs line go up a little bit, which is completely normal for late cycle behavior. When you get later in the cycle, deals get a little bit harder to come together, one. Two, there are more luxury deals that pencil later in the cycle than earlier in the cycle, those at the higher end tend to be the deals that require key money, but that's on the margin and you know I think overall the number of deals in our pipeline that have any contribution from us has remained largely consistent.So over the last two years, you know that number is about 10% of the deals than the pipeline has had any contribution from us and that number, that percentage has been pretty consistent for a while.
Joe Greff: Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys, just one quick one and then a quick follow-up. Just in terms of as you guys are thinking about the second half of this year Chris, how much is the U.S. economic activity driving kind of your outlook versus the forward pace that you are kind of looking at right now? And then just more broadly, obviously guys raise your capital return guidance for 2019 in the period. As you think about buyback activity right now, have you altered you know your strategy or stance on capital returns looking ahead at all.
Chris Nassetta: I’ll let Kevin take the second, I'll take the first. The short answer is, is we look at our forecasting as implied in my prior comments, it's done on a very granular basis. So yes, I mean we have a view of what's going on in the economy, we have a view of you know whether it's going to go up, down or sideways.I sort of gave you our view for the moment as sideways, but the bulk of our forecasting with some you know sort of overlay is really based on property by property analysis and looking at the pace of the business and the bookings, and looking at where we – what we need to fill that would not already be on the books and making an assessment of what we think the probability of being able to do that is. So it is – I would say it is a much heavier degree of looking at our forward pace and position than it is just a broad overview of here’s what we think the economy is.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, thank you.
Chris Nassetta: And then Carlo on capital return, the short answer is no, we’ve not changed our outlook on capital return. I think what you are seeing in the range is, we are little bit deeper in the year. Our EBITDA outlook is a little bit higher and so solving for the mid-point of our sort of stated leverage range gets you to a little higher mid-point and we are halfway through the year, so we're tightening the range. And I think the way to think about it is – the way we've always thought about it, which is we like the stock you know almost at any price.We like the outlook for the business model and the returns that we can drive by buying back the stock and so the combination of a modest dividend and then buybacks that are going to be, you know think about recurring free cash flow, plus re-leveraging is coming back no matter what, and we are kind of giving you a range you know of outcomes that could vary depending on how we think of the outlook is for the business, and the price will vary a little bit within the range, but largely we think about capital returning in a really consistent way.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, thank you both.
Operator: The next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony Powell: Hello, good morning. I want to focus a bit more in China. You mentioned slower leisure demand that there a few times. Is the demand different in the Tier 1 cities in high end resorts compared to some more moderate Tiers or is it slowed down pretty broad based and maybe some more detail on corporate government and leisure will be great?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, so look, I think Anthony it’s been pretty consistent across the board in China. You know I mean over half the business is leisure driven in China and 90% of it is driven in countries. So when you see their economy slowing the way it is and them sort of you know pulling back the reins a little bit on spending, you are going to see that flow through to our business and so, but we really haven't seen. You know you are not seeing sort of the business you know dramatically constructing and the food and beverage being limited the way it had been a couple years ago. I think it's really broadly driven by leisure.
Chris Nassetta: Business has held up and the group which is a much smaller part of the business there than it is here has actually held up much better than leisure. And you know the other thing not to be – probably you know because as I said we assumed the current trend to continue in China, that’s what’s built in the forecast. Recognizing we've been through this in China before, to the extent that the trade deal is met, you know the Chinese leisure consumer more than anywhere in the world I've seen can flip around pretty quickly.Now if we just you know at this point, this thing has been going on long enough where we said, you know – we can't forecast that. But reality is, if a trade deal is done, I mean it will take some time to you know sort of flip it around and get back, you know get them back traveling, but I think there's an opportunity for that to happen and for that to be you know a better potential upside at least later in the year.But again who knows, you know teams are going next week and it is impossible to know what the result of that will be at this point, so we just assume that that doesn't happen.
Anthony Powell: Alright, thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. I think a lot of my questions have been addressed already, but I did notice that your franchise RevPAR grew better than managed RevPAR in the quarter. Just a little bit different than the overall U.S. trends and wondering if there is anything to call out there?
Kevin Jacobs: No, I don't think there's anything there Robin. I think that I'm actually not sure what number you're looking at, but I mean at the higher end RevPAR actually performed stronger than you know at the lower end in terms of brands, so nothing to call out there.
Robin Farley: I was looking at your franchise of 1.6 and managed hotels at 1.3 and that the limited service tend to be more franchise and managed would tend to be more full service, and that's a little bit different than that what we see with.
Kevin Jacobs: Not necessarily – that’s not necessarily the case in the U.S., so I think that's probably what you're seeing there, is we actually do have a higher level of managed franchise of full service hotels in the U.S. so there is nothing to extrapolate there.
Robin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Hey, good morning. Chris I've got a two-parter on capital, capital commitments. And the first one really goes back to your press release over the past week about growing your luxury brands and the footprint in it. It seems to me with 94 million Honors members and the engagement statistics, all the positive momentum you have there, it's a dramatic mismatch with the really limited number of luxury options they have to use their points and I'm just wondering why it took so long to kind of reinvigorate the growth in luxury and whether you thought about putting more of your own capital in to get a quicker growth in that segment.
Chris Nassetta: I appreciate the question. I read you’re not on Sunday Bill. I don't agree with it entirely, but here's what I would say. The Press Release was obviously about sort of pounding our chest about a bunch of cool new hotels that are opening up. Since the day I walked in the door of this company, 12 years ago, we have been focused on luxury. This isn't something that we finally, as you describe, not me, you know we finally decided to focus on luxury. We’ve been – it takes a long time to make any of these deals happen, and so we've been very focused on it for two fundamental reasons.The first is some of our customers want it, right. I mean a lot of our – you know at different times. The second is for loyalty to have it in the system from an aspirational point of view, we think it's important, so we spent a lot of time on it.What I would say objectively is we've made incredible progress. We went from basically nothing 10 or 12 years ago to having open or in the pipeline 110 incredible luxury hotels. I'd say at this point, while we have a lot more we want to do, we have captured most of the most important urban and resort markets. We do have some gaps. We're working very hard at filling those gaps, but we are making tremendous progress, and yes on occasion we are using our balance sheet.If you look at the amount of sort of outstanding key money commitments we have, it would weigh disproportionately to luxury for that very reason. But I would say, and you said it, Bill it implied in your question, it’s obviously what we're doing is working, right, because I'd say we have the market leading statistics in loyalty, not to be defensive. I mean the growth rate in our loyalty program, engagement rate, level of Honors occupancy is working, right and so there's a whole bunch of reasons for that.One the luxury strategy is I think working; two, what you have to remember is while people aspire to go to the Maldives and do all these things, that’s not actually what they do with their behavior, right. What they do more than not, is use it for the mundane things in life like going to you know New York City for the weekend with their husband or wife or going to a Reading, Pennsylvania for a soccer tournament with their kids and using the point they earned traveling on business to satisfy their needs and their personal likes. That is what they – you know if you look at the behavior.And so when you think about it, think about it this way, like we are not a start-up. We have 6,000 hotels that people can redeem at in 115 countries around the globe, right. That can satisfy a lot of needs. We have a 110 open or pipeline luxury, we have almost 200 great resorts around the world. If you look at the upper end of upper upscale with all respect to some most of our competitors who would call that luxury and we don't. So take the upper-end of the Hilton brand, that's probably another 150 or 200 hotels.So in reality, out of the 6,000 hotels we have 400 or 500 of them sort of by a broader categorization of sort of luxury in resort would meet those needs, in addition to the other 5,500 that meet most of their everyday needs. And so we're focused on luxury, we're making great progress. If you went and saw any of the newer luxury Waldorfs or Conrads that have opened, I’d encourage it. I think you would be really impressed, but it is a broad sort of network effect that we are creating to allow loyalty members to get a great value proposition.Luxury is part of it, but it is not all of it. It is – and I would argue honestly as reflected in our numbers, I would argue while it's important, it's a relatively small part of it in terms of the other parts of the ecosystem that help drive loyalty.
Bill Crow: That's a thorough and satisfying answer. So I appreciate it. I’ll leave it there. Thanks Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Alright, we’ll debate it offline.
Bill Crow: Yeah, you got it.
Chris Nassetta: Alright.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: I guess, maybe two follow-ups if I could. One, this one is guess for Kevin. Looking to 2020, how realistic is it to expect much growth in the $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion capital return. There is certainly incremental cash flow, but pipeline and RevPAR growth slowing a bit. I'm wondering how that shapes, how you think about the structure of repurchase activity or capital return next year?
Kevin Jacobs: Well, hey look Jeff it's early, so I should probably do the responsible thing and say it's a little bit early to be giving you know sort of capital return guidance. But if you think about it, I mean Chris said earlier in the call, our model is a lot less dependent on same store sales growth today and much more pipeline dependent. Our pipeline growth for the record is not slowing and we do not think our net unit growth is slowing.So thus, those hotels will enter the system, they'll pay fees. Our free cash flow – you ought to assume that our free cash flow will grow slightly and will continue to re-leverage the business, and so our capital available to return to shareholders ought to look you know very similar or slightly higher than it does this year.
Chris Nassetta: Yep, I agree. Keeping in perspective one technical thing and then a broader view, every point in same store RevPAR assumption has the impact of being where it’s about $10 million to $12 million of free cash flow. So in the end it does not move the needle on that and the way to – I think on a broad base we’ve sort of covered this, but it's probably worth covering again to make sure we are abundantly clear.On return of capital, I would say and share buyback, we put it in three buckets. One, free cash flow. You should assume that we are every year always on deploying our free cash flow to do our minor dividend which we don't intend to increase and then you just all the rest of that to buy back stock.You should also assume as we continue to grow EBITDA with this resilient model that in the normal everyday sort of approach will be to re-lever, to sort of you know circle the mid-point of our 3 to 3.5 range. If you look at the financing transactions we just did, where does it take us for the year, 3.25, shocking and that gets it for the 1.5 the 1.8.There is also an opportunity which I’ve talked about, the potentially for short periods of time to lever the company up even more highly beyond that you know for a period of time and then de-lever and accelerate repurchases and what I would say is that sort of the more opportunistic side of it, we did it a little bit with H&A, but that would be an environment where we saw a major dislocation occur and we wanted to take advantage of that major dislocation.So I think every day in and day out you ought to think about our buyback, like what we are doing this year, use all our free cash flow and re-lever to a relatively conservative level and buyback stock.Going beyond that, if there's a big dislocation, I think you know we would certainly consider. You know it’s something we’ve talked about around our board table, and won’t have to decide the time the lever-up incrementally for a period of time, because the free cash flow obviously would allow you to lever down, and to take advantage of dislocations in the market. But it's sort of in those three buckets, two of which you are experiencing this year, the third of which obviously doesn't look likely.
Jeff Donnelly: And Chris, now I don’t want to beat a dead horse, but what's the path to getting to the top end of year 1% to 2% annual guidance and RevPAR, because if you are facing tough comps internationally in the back half of the year, and like you said, let’s assume steady U.S. growth, it just feels like the acceleration you would need in the second half of the year, because this is just unlikely to kind of pull your first half of the year up that much if you will?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, I mean I think as I always do, that we’ll end up somewhere in the middle, right. I mean we narrowed the range. We are usually at two point range, we narrowed it to one, because I think you know who knows, you can't – we don't have a crystal ball. Reality is, you should assume as you always should that the middle of the range is what we think will really happen.Could it get the two? I mean we looked at scenarios where it could. Do I think it's likely? No. I mean what would have to happen? The U.S. would have to you know pick up a little bit. You’d have to have the choppiness, particularly in business transient sort of stabilize. The group is going to perform because it mostly on the book. You’d have to sort of have the caution flags pulled back in in the U.S.Is that possible? Sure. You can get a trade deal done with China, people could feel a little bit better, you know people could start spending a little bit more, traveling, and so it's not impossible. I mean it is possible to get to the two. In our view it was not really possible to get to the three, which is why we took it off the table. I think it is possible.The other things that would contribute to it would be you know China. China, while it's not a huge part of our overall system, you know it was growing at a much, much higher level. So it’s going too flat or modestly down does have some impact. So if you said the U.S. you know stiffened up a little bit and people took a few caution flags in. China flipped around with a trade deal, could you be in to? Yeah.Do I think we will? No I think we will be around 1.5, that's why we gave a range and you know trying to tighten a range more than point when we are halfway through the year, just you know to be honest just didn’t feel prudent.
Jeff Donnelly: Great, thanks guys.
Chris Nassetta: Yep.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi Group. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thank you. You’ve gotten to most of them, but I just wanted to ask you. You noted your strength and focus on the mid-market segment and you know we continued to see Tru put up the outsized RevPAR gains relative to other – your other brands in that segment. I’m just wondering, do you think any of the growth there is coming at the expense of Hampton Inn or do you think it's more just the expansion of footprint and the brand containing to gain traction.
Chris Nassetta: No, I don’t. I mean you can't say that they don't compete in some markets at all, but it is really a different segment, that's how we designed it. We spent a lot of time on that and how we think about the go-to-market commercial strategy is to keep it in its swim lane. I think why Tru is gaining, and if you look at it Hampton is gaining share too. So Hampton is not, like you're not seeing, Tur go up and Hampton go down, Hampton’s gaining share, and Hampton is the highest average market share brand that we have. So it is both an absolute sense and a growth sense performing at an incredibly high level.Why Tru I think is doing well, is honestly to think about that segment, no offense to everybody else out there. You know the reason we launched Tru is because we didn't think anybody in that segment was doing it well. We didn't think that there was at scale a brand that delivered a good product, consistent, clean with simple service delivery that resonated with customers and I think what we're finding is we were right. Right the customers are flocking to Tru because it's just a better, newer, cleaner product and what it’s taking share from is folks in that competitive set.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thanks. And then Chris when you just look back at prior cycles, you know let's say the U.S. economy does take a little bit more of a down shift. I mean when developers are looking to access capital, do banks or lenders, are they more likely to require the development fee within a major brands system like your own? I mean do you see relative gains within maybe the smaller overall development pipeline?
Chris Nassetta: There is no question that that’s the case. Frankly to me I think we've been a huge beneficiary of that even in the last two or three years as lending standards have tightened. I think we are – I mean I know it's me pounding, you know pat myself and Hilton on the back, we are more financeable. I mean just go talk to a dozen lending institutions and ask them their view. Why? Because we drive system wide better market share. We drive better profitability, easier to underwrite, less risky, we've been doing this 100 years and so yes, we are already taking an unfair share amount of development. In an environment that’s gets worse I think our sheer numbers go up, you know they are they always have and I think they will, as long as we continue to drive the market share premiums that we are.
Smedes Rose: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over the Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks everybody. As always we appreciate you taking the time. We'll look forward to talking with you after the third quarter and hope everybody enjoys the rest of your summer. Get some time to relax and be with friends and family. Take care.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now completed. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-05-02 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hilton First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our first quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary just this month, we're proud of all of the accomplishments over this last century, a century where we hosted over 3 billion guests, employed over 10 million team members and contributed over $1 trillion of economic impact. But as we look to the next 100 years, we're even more excited and confident in our ability to drive continued success. We believe that success will ultimately be driven by the strength of our model, which should continue to drive outperformance. That outperformance will be driven by industry-leading market share premiums that drive premium hotel performance and attract more capital from owners, which, in turn, drives higher net unit growth. This, combined with the resiliency and capital-light nature of our fee-based business, allows us to grow free cash flow and return greater and greater amounts of capital over time and through all parts of the business cycle. Turning to the quarter. We're pleased to report a good start to the year with adjusted EBITDA and EPS ahead of our expectations and RevPAR growth near the midpoint of our guidance range. Both system-wide and U.S. RevPAR grew 1.8%, outperforming the changed scale-weighted industry data due to strong market share gains across all brands and major regions. Overall, system-wide RevPAR index premiums increased more than 230 basis points. System-wide group business remained strong as we've seen for several quarters with RevPAR up 3.7%. Transient RevPAR grew approximately 1% driven by steady U.S. leisure demand tempered somewhat by softer U.S. corporate demand in March and somewhat weaker international performance. For the full year, our outlook remains largely in line with our prior expectations as macro indicators suggest continued growth across global economies. The outlook for the U.S. for GDP growth should continue to support steady demand and solid pricing gains. Additionally, our corporate negotiated business and forward group bookings for 2019 both remained solid. On the development front, we had a strong start to the year. In the quarter, we opened more than 12,000 growth rooms, achieved 7% net unit growth and exceeded our expectation for construction starts and approvals. We increased our pipeline to 371,000 rooms boosted by growth across U.S. and international markets. We also continue to see positive trends across existing projects as rooms under construction increased to represent more than 52% of our pipeline. For the full year, we expect this momentum to continue. We remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth. Additionally, we expect another year of record signings with steady trends in the U.S. and double-digit increases across both the APAC and EMEA regions. This continued pipeline growth should lead to solid unit growth for the next several years. We remain disciplined and deliberate in our approach to expansion, following demand trends around the world. We evaluate each market opportunity to the right products in the right locations to best serve guests and to maximize on our returns. Our attractive owner value proposition allows us to grow with minimal use of our own capital. Over 90% of our pipeline does not have any capital contribution for us, a trend that has remained consistent over recent years. This supports higher net fees per room once those projects are complete. For that reason, the vast majority of new units enter our system at virtually 100% margin and with an infinite yield. Our organic growth strategy has yielded fantastic results, spanning multiple brands and countries. Just last month, we celebrated the grand opening of the Conrad Washington, D.C. This hotel marks our first luxury property in the nation's capital. The 360-room hotel features 30,000 square feet of luxury retail space, 32,000 square feet of meeting space and the Sakura Club, which provides exclusive access to an elevated and personalized hospitality experience. We also opened the Conrad Hangzhou, a 50-story luxury hotel in China's growing technology and innovation hub. The property reflects the brand's modern stylists and dynamic spirit while demonstrating our commitment to expanding our presence across China with a well-rounded portfolio. In the quarter, we also signed several agreements that we expect to contribute to growth over the longer term, including 4 new hotels totaling 1,400 rooms that will be part of a spectacular mixed-use project in Riyadh. The hotel will carry flags ranging from Hilton Garden Inn to Waldorf Astoria. Additionally, we signed an agreement to add 5 new hotels in France within the next 5 years. To drive further growth, we recently launched our newest brand, Signia Hilton, an innovative product that will set a new standard for the meetings and events industry. Each property will feature a minimum of 500 guest rooms, at least 75 square feet of event space per room and state-of-the-art technology. The brand will debut with openings of properties in Orlando, Atlanta and Indianapolis. On the loyalty front, we ended the quarter with nearly 90 million Honors members, was up 20% year-over-year. On average, we are enrolling approximately 1.5 million Honors members per month, and they're more engaged than ever before with over half of our total membership active. In the quarter, Honors percentage occupancy reached over 60% and was up 170 basis points year-over-year, demonstrating that members are also staying with us more often. We're always striving to better meet guests' evolving needs and think great products and innovation are only a part of that story. Guest satisfaction relies heavily on the talent and passion of our team to deliver incredible experiences, and creating an exceptional workplace culture is extremely important to that effort. For that reason, we're thrilled to be ranked #1 on Fortune's best companies to work for list in the U.S., becoming the first hospitality company in history and the first non-tech company since 2004 to achieve this number 1 rating. Overall, we're very pleased with the first quarter results and feel good about our momentum for the balance of the year. Our story is simple. Our resilient business model, growing market share, capital-light development strategy should lead to significant free cash flow generation and strong shareholder returns. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary, we are confident this truly will be our most dynamic year yet. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter and outlook for the rest of the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.8% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis. Results benefited from strong group business, particularly given holiday shifts, and increased market share partially offset by softer-than-anticipated international growth. Adjusted EBITDA of $499 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 12% year-over-year as our fee segment outperformed expectations. In the quarter, management franchise fees increased 12% to $517 million, ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range due to better-than-expected license fees and roughly $10 million of timing items. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items grew 16% to $0.80, also exceeding expectations. Turning to our regional performance and outlook. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1.8% with outperformance primarily driven by increasing market share and strong group business. Our U.S. portfolio also benefited from recently completed renovations across our Embassy Suites and Hampton portfolios. For full year 2019, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in line with our system-wide guidance range based on steady fundamentals. In the Americas outside of the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew 4.4% versus the prior year given the strength in the Caribbean and Latin America. Puerto Rico saw particularly strong results with double-digit rate gains led by solid transient trends. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our system-wide guidance. RevPAR in Europe grew 3.2% in the quarter as London benefited from strong international inbound travel, and good group business boosted our results in Barcelona. However, softening transient demand in the broader UK tempered growth. We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be at the higher end of our system-wide range given strong trends in Turkey and continued growth in Continental Europe, modestly offset by uncertainty in the UK. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR fell 5.7% in the quarter. Similar to the trends we've been seeing in prior quarters, significant levels of new supply in the United Arab Emirates continued to pressure ADR. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be down in the low single digits given continued leisure softness across the UAE and Saudi Arabia. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 1% in the quarter largely due to slowdowns in intra-China leisure travel, especially over the Chinese New Year period as well as some of the international outbound travel to China. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the 3% to 5% range accounting for softer performance in the quarter and an expected reacceleration throughout the year driven by good group and event-driven business in Japan and an overall pickup in China. Moving to the, moving to guidance. For full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth consistent with prior guidance of 1% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.265 billion to $2.305 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 9% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $3.74 to $3.84. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 2%, including a modest headwind from calendar shifts. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $590 million to $610 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.98 to $1.03. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchases. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter for a total of $44 million in dividends. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For 2019, we continue to expect to return between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Before we open the call for questions, we want to answer a question we've been getting recently about the resiliency of our business model in certain downsized scenarios. Our sensitivity to changes in the macro environment is materially lower than it has been historically given the spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses and the nature of our remaining fee business. Fees generate more than 90% of our earnings with top line-driven fees accounting for more than 90% of those fees. Additionally, our incentive management fees, which account for just 10% of total fees, are less volatile and roughly 85% of them do not stand behind any owner's priority return. Resiliency is further supported by our strong net unit growth and continued disciplined approach to corporate expenses. As you can see from our guidance, we feel good about our outlook for the year and are not forecasting RevPAR declines. However, to be responsive to these questions and illustrate the resiliency of our model, we would expect flat to slightly positive growth in adjusted EBITDA and positive growth in free cash flow in an environment where RevPAR were to decline 5% to 6%. As a result, we think we are well positioned to continue driving shareholder returns through all parts of the cycle. Further details on our first quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Denise, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli: Chris, Kevin, it's been more or less 2.5 months since the last call. And I'm just wondering kind of obviously, the March data that was out there wasn't great from, I think, most people's point of view. What have you guys seen since we last spoke with respect to the demand environment domestically that makes you more or, and/or less confident with your outlook?
Chris Nassetta: Great question. I suspect, Carlo, on everybody's mind, so thanks for asking it. Maybe I'll tell you about the quarter a little bit more, although we gave some comments in the prepared remarks, and then talk about expectations for the full year. I think, thinking about the quarter maybe and the full year breaking it down between the U.S. and international and then breaking it down separately by segments and comparing it sort of how we felt when we sat at this table doing this last quarter. I would say in an overarching way, it's not a lot different, okay? But I'll give you a little bit more than that. I think if you look at the quarter and we look at what we had forecasted for the quarter, the U.S. was pretty much in line in the first quarter with what we thought. I'll talk about segments in a minute. International was a little bit lower, not surprisingly. So that drove a little bit lower result overall in the first quarter than we thought but not material. If you look at the segments sort of embedded in your question, group was a little bit better than we thought, and transient was a little bit worse than we thought. The net result wasn't a whole lot, as I say, it didn't drag the overall answer down a lot. But leisure hung in there if you break transient apart and was pretty stable. It was a little bit lower than we had seen on average for certainly the first half of last year, but that's exactly what we expected and exactly what we talked about in the last call. Business transient, though, was a little bit weaker than we thought, really driven by March. Our view on that, although it's really hard to be honestly perfectly scientific about it, our view on that when we've studied all of the data and talked internally about it is as much as spring break, as much as Easter moved out of the month and you would think you'll get a real benefit from that, what happened as a result of Easter being so late was that spring break got spread out throughout the whole month. And so when we look at the travel patterns as it related and sort of overlaid the spring break season with it, we think it had a material impact on business travel during that period. And that was what was driving the bulk of the business transient weakness in March. On that, let me tell you about the full year. So as we think about the full year, again, breaking it down, U.S. and international versus what we were thinking when we gave you guidance, it's about the same. U.S. is pretty much our view today reasonably consistent with where it was. International, the answer is reasonably consistent with where we were. How you get there is a little bit different. We, obviously, with the print in Asia Pacific notwithstanding in Kevin's remarks, he said we think we're going to be a 3% to 5%, and it's going to get better. And we feel reasonably confident it will because of event-driven issues in Japan and are already seeing some reacceleration in China. Given the print of 1% in the first quarter, we think Asia Pacific will be lower than we thought. But at the same time, Europe, core Europe is going to be a little bit better than we thought. And Americas, non-U. S. is going to be a bit better than we thought. So the net result of all of that is, honestly, when we lay all this out, that U.S. and international are pretty much going to play out in a very consistent way, at least in our forecasting, to what we thought a quarter ago. If you look at the segments, I would say similar answer. The group is going to lead the charge again this year and have the highest level of growth. I think it will sort of end up at the midpoint to the high end of our guidance. I think that is, at this point, fully supported by group position on the book, so we feel pretty good about that. On the transient side, I would say expectations, the demand is going to be healthy and continuing to grow in a way that will deliver sort of towards the midpoint of our guidance on transient. We think both leisure and business will be in that zone. Obviously, leisure had sort of been in that zone. Business transient, at least in March, was not. So we're obviously watching it very carefully. But as we look at the trends getting past the Easter effect of April into May and June, while it's still early, it does look like business transient sort of goes back to a more normal pattern. And so that's sort of the underpinnings for how we maintained, if you will, our guidance of 1% to 3%., not surprisingly as I've said many, many times on these calls. I mean, what you should generally do is look at the midpoint of our guidance as a strong indicator for the, if we had to pick a point, the point that we feel most comfortable with. And given we're still early in the year, we're trying to create a range of outcomes around it. But 2% is the midpoint of our guidance, and that's, frankly, that's sort of where we're most comfortable. And when I sat here a quarter ago, when Kevin and I sat here, that's what we were thinking pretty much within 0.10 point at that time.
Operator: The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan.
Joe Greff: Obviously, the stock is reacting very strongly to today's reports in your comments, Chris and Kevin. So my question related to the stock price is how sensitive are you to capital returns specifically to buybacks with a higher stock price?
Chris Nassetta: Joe, the reality is we gave you a range of 1.3% to 1.8%, and we intend for that to be the range. I think if you look at the midpoint of our leverage, which should be 3.25, that really gets you more to the mid- to the high end of that range, which I'd say, it would probably be the sort of the higher probability of where we end up. And we're obviously, if you've seen in the first quarter, we bought, I think, on average in the low $70. So we get, we're trying to spend a little as we can buy, and at the same time, the stock is performing well isn't going to stop us from achieving our guidance. In the sense that in every scenario that we look at, given the resiliency and strength of the model, buying our stock is still a significant premium to our weighted average cost of capital. And in terms of the grid that we're looking at, there is no price that's in that grid that I think would take us out of the market. We like the stock. We like it at $70, we like it $80, we like it at $90. We'll like it at $100 and beyond because we think the future is obviously quite strong.
Joe Greff: Great. And then, Chris, you mentioned before about all the levers that you're doing to grow membership within Hilton Honors. Can you talk about where you think you can go in terms of occupancy, system-wide occupancy related to your loyalty program? And maybe outside of the lodging, what other businesses do you look to benchmark where that dependency should be? And that's all for me.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, maybe give you a little bit more on Honors because I know we get a lot of questions on it, so I'll sort of give a broader response. Obviously, we gave you the numbers. The Honors membership was up 20% to 90 million. Some of them as, and we gave you, it's over 60%, up 170 bps. What we didn't say is that over the last 2 years, on Honors occupancy was up 400 basis points. We did, I did talk about how we've gone to having over 50% of our members engaged. By the way, if you go back, I don't know, 5 years ago, that number was probably 25%. We have a much smaller number. So I think if you do the math, we have probably 6 to 8x the number of engaged members in Honors as compared to 5 years ago. And I think the basic underpinnings of our strategy are, one, to make sure that we create the best value proposition, so that essentially, you have to be a member of Honors. You're crazy not to be. That means pricing. If you're an Honors member, you get the best price guarantee. Period. End of story. There is nowhere else to get a better price. That, the work that we're doing with our app, with our online, web direct and online presence that we're taking friction out of it, that we're making it a much better experience to dream, to book, the shop and ultimately, book. That, the digital tools in our app, particularly our Digital Key, straight-to-room, Connected Room, all of those things are only available to Honors members. And that those are powerful enough, in addition to these other things like pricing and other things to really be a draw for Honors. The other thing we've been in the last 2 or 3 years spending a lot of time on is both our highest-level members and our lowest-level members because we love all our members, and we want everyone engaged. And the reason we've been able to double our percentage of engaged members and get 6 to 8x the numbers is because we've been focusing on both. At the highest level, we're doing a, we've been doing a bunch of things. But some of the bigger things are more generous, elite earnings bonuses that our highest-level members love, unlimited milestone bonuses, elite rollover nights, the ability to gift elite status to a travel partner. There are about 20 other things, but those are some of the ones that come to mind, the things that just make it that much more compelling for those that already give us the largest share of their wallet to continue to stay with us. At the lowest level where people don't travel that much, our blue members are, and the first few levels, it's about creating value for them. And beyond just you get the best price, they get the best price, of course. But what are, if they're going to collect points they don't stay enough to trade them into nights, what do they do with them? How do you create value? So our points and money slider, which I believe we're the only one that really do in the industry, so you can use any number of points with a matching dollar amount and redeem for nights. Or shop with points or deal with Amazon where you can buy anything you want. Amazon Prime, you can use certain Honors points. Or points pooling where you can, without any additional charge, pool your points between members and use those points. Those are a few. Again, there are many more examples of things that we're doing to get our lowest-level members that maybe they're only low-level members potentially because they don't travel that much generally. But we love them, too, and we want them to be engaged with us. The other thing is the co-brand card. We've spent a lot of time and effort in figuring out how to source that a couple of years ago with AMEX, and we can get more into it. But it's been, the cards, the array of cards have been incredibly well received and driving real strong value proposition. If you look at our base cardholders, they have 2 times the stay activity that you would find in an average active member. And as you go up into the higher-level cards, it's 4 time the stay activity. And so those cards are helping drive loyalty and drive share. And then a whole bunch of things in Honors on the experiential side whether that's Live Nation, Formula 1 and a whole bunch of other things that we're looking at that will make, that are really cool ideas and things that more to come on where you give your Honors members a value proposition and ways to redeem those points that are for things that they can't otherwise get on their own. So in terms of your, you asked a question, and I didn't forget it, which is what level of occupancy. I'm looking at my team, of course, I tell them why. If it's the best deal and all these things, why it isn't 100% of our occupancy Honors? Because it's crazy that people don't join, but obviously, that's a bit of a pipe dream. But I think it can be well over 60%. I think, ultimately, over the next 5 years, my goal would be that we're in the 70% to 80% range because we create a story that is compelling enough, and we make sure that our, that broadly, our customers and others that might consider us understand that being a member of Honors is being, is joining an elite club that gives you a whole bunch of experiences and things and value that you can't get otherwise.
Operator: The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet.
Harry Curtis: Chris, last quarter, you commented that you're finding some success increasing your occupancy during the shoulder periods. And what's interesting is that your U.S. RevPAR performance was about 100 basis points stronger than the Smith Travel data. Can you talk about to what degree that strategy is driving that versus the success that you've seen in your brands and the premiums that they're generating?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. It's a really good question and deserves to get answered. Unfortunately, maybe you won't be satisfied with it because it's classically not any one thing. I mean, we, in the U.S., our market share numbers, as I stated in my prepared comments, we're really strong in the quarter, up 260 basis points. And certainly, some of it is on the commercial side being smarter about our pricing, our customer-centric pricing model where we got off the bar and we do semi flex and fully flex with a premium for fully flexed and a slight discount for semi flex. That clearly is driving the right behavior in terms of lowering cancellations. Cancellations are down over the last couple of years by 10%. And I think we're at a better reasonable level. And it's driving a bit of a premium where more people are buying and consuming the fully flexed product and that are taking the discount, which is where all of our testing set, and so it's giving us a little boost. So that, there's a little bit of that. We've obviously been pushing new marketing campaigns with Anna Kendrick otherwise that are very focused on direct book and the value proposition and a value guarantee where we guarantee 25% off if you find a better price, which is trying to point out the customers that might otherwise think because they're bombarded with all the digital and other forms of media that say they can get a better deal somewhere else that we're going to guarantee it. And that's been working. But the part that will be less satisfying for you, it's a whole bunch of other things. I think what we're doing with our product strategy, what we're doing with service strategy, being number 1 Great Place to Work, I wanted to talk about and congratulate our team because we're in a service business. And having our team inspired and motivated to do great things means, and feeling good about what they're doing with us means they're going to do better job with our customers. So it's a lot about service. It's a lot about loyalty, which I won't go back into because in Joe's question, I answered it at great length. But it's a bunch of other things. It's a bunch of the things that we're doing in technology with our web presence and increasing conversion. So long-winded way of saying it's coming from a lot of different places, which is what I love about it, which is it's not 1 trick, and it's not sort of 1 thing that's flash in the pan. It's a whole bunch of different strategies that are converging that are working. And of course, our job is to keep them working, which we intend to do.
Harry Curtis: Very good. And just a quick follow-up going back to Asia. Did I hear you correctly that you are seeing some reacceleration in Asia, specifically China?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, we are. Post Chinese New Year, we are starting to see some pickup all stop. We expect to see more, to be honest, and then the comps also gets a bit easier. And then in Japan, which, remember, Japan is still, from a bottom line point of view, the biggest market for us in Asia. There are a bunch of big event-driven things happening in the back half of the year that are sort of money in the bag, meaning they are happening, and they would definitely help boost the business in Japan, which is going to help the second half of the year in APAC.
Operator: The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.
Stephen Grambling: Chris, your opening remarks emphasized the bull case from the network effects of the business model. As we look out over the next few years and think through the expansion of international markets in China in particular, I guess, what are some of the added benefits that investors should be thinking about from the increased scale if we look at other developing markets as a road map?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Well, I mean, I talked about it, I think, in our last call, Stephen. Thank you for the question. I mean, what, it all starts for us to make the model work and if we're to continue to be organic growth and capital-light and infinite yields and 100% margin, all those fun things that we like, it all starts with doing a great job for customers but also doing a great job for owners and driving returns for owners. What owners are looking at is share. And so I think what's been happening over the last, honestly, over the last 12 years but increasingly over the last 2 or 3, and I talked about it on the last couple of calls, is we have been building the network effect that we've had for quite some time in the United States and the other mega regions around the world. And even as we are not nearly as distributed there, we've been investing in our commercial infrastructure and our loyalty and other things sort out ahead of the curve, and it's really starting to hit pay dirt. So last year was the first time in history we grew market share everywhere in the world, including the U.S. But for the first time, the other regions actually were eager to frankly eclipse our market share, which is hard to do. But it is, I think, testimonial to the fact that the network effect is starting to work there. And so I think that is in the first quarter was a carry on to that. And I suspect if we do our job, you'll see the same thing this year, which is all of the regions will be, so the international regions will be equal to or greater in market share, and all of them will show growth. That's a fabulous leading indicator to what should happen with the network effect because that attracts more capital. Owners know that. It's a small network of folks. And in the end, when they're signing up in 2030, in many cases, longer deals, it's really about having the confidence that you're going to be around. We've been around 100 years. We'll be around another 100 years. So you're not going to disappear, and that you're going to be able to drive premium performance because they're investing billions of dollars in the bricks and mortar. And so I think as we think about our obsession with market share, which we have for good reason and the trajectory on that, I think it makes us feel really good. I think it's why you see the pipeline growing, rooms under construction going in NUG. I feel, as I said in my prepared comments, quite good about the next several years just given what's in production, what's under construction around the world and our ability to continue to do a component of our NUG through conversions.
Stephen Grambling: More direct follow-up, perhaps quickly. How should we think about royalty rates and partnership opportunities in those markets as you gain scale?
Chris Nassetta: I think that as we gain scale and as we drive market share, I think there are opportunities to increase royalty rates. I wouldn't say that you're going to see a seismic shift anytime soon because we would rather perform ahead of doing that, but I think there are opportunities. And certainly, as we build our loyalty platforms to get to a much greater scale not unlike the U.S. and our deal with Amex, there are opportunities in the co-brand space that we're already pursuing and other partnership opportunities as we continue to build that network. So this is, I would say, and we said it at the IPO, we said it at the spin, it's a really powerful platform that we've built. And the nice thing as an investor is we kind of have all the pieces of it to make it work. We have to make it work, okay? It's a lot of hard work. But we've got the scale. We've got the broad geographic diversity. We have the chain scale diversity. We're obviously adding some brands to fill in spaces. But we've got the, we've got what we need to make the magic. And now it really is about grinding and making it work and continuing to grow market share, deliver better returns for owners by doing better things for customers, and the virtuous cycle will not only continue but hopefully pick up.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Shaun Kelley: Chris, maybe just sort of to sum up on, yes, I think, a lot of discussion has happened here on the market share gains and some of the systems and in Honors and investments that you're making. So could you maybe just sort of give us a little bit of a view to the future on where are you making the largest investments from here, both maybe in terms of dollars and management time as you start to refine some of these programs? It seems like they're all working extraordinarily well at the moment. So where are you kind of, where do you see some of the biggest opportunities? And where are you kind of putting your money to drive some of these network effects going forward?
Chris Nassetta: I would say probably in 3 primary areas, and I won't repeat myself: Honors always is the most important engine that we have, obviously, for loyalty but broadly for market share. So I gave you a list of some of the things we have done. There's a whole list of other things that we will be doing. I'd rather not get into it. The limits of time, it's probably not a great place to do it. But lots of additional things going on in Honors with the objective being what I said, ultimately, we want Honors occupancy to be the vast majority of our occupancy because you're crazy not to be a member just because the value proposition in the experiential side of Honors is so good that you're crazy not to be a member. And we're, I think we're amongst, if not, the highest in the industry in percentage of occupancy at the moment. But I think we could do a lot better. And my gauge is not what others are doing. It's what I think we can do. The other area which is related to Honors is technology where we obviously brought in over the last couple of years a whole bunch of incremental talent in this area to figure out how to do add more delight to the customer experience and take more friction out of the experience, whether that is with the app and Connected Room, Digital Key, room selection. You're going to see a whole bunch of really neat things coming out of those efforts, payments area, and the list goes on, but a huge amount of investment, system investment. Let me be careful on that because of the way this works, not for the record for those that don't know our model as well, not investment that comes off, comes out of our income statement or our balance sheet because of the way the system works. We have lots of opportunities to invest in these things but, with system funds but significant investment there. And then marketing, investing, not just in spending more in marketing, which we have been doing to a degree and taking away money, but how we spend it. And the world is a very different place than it was even a few years ago. And we're obviously trying to continue not only to get drive more market share premiums, but we're trying to do it in a way that is most profitable, which means driving more direct business. And so how we go to market, what our message is, how frequently sort of to be able to, have our voice rise above, I think, is really important. So there's clearly, again, those are system when you think about all of these, just to be clear, these are system investments, not Hilton off our P&L investment. But that's where the bulk of the investing dollars come from. Those are probably the 3. There are a whole bunch of others. Those are probably the 3 areas I'd say that are the tip of the spear for us in continuing to ultimately drive share.
Operator: The next question will be from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.
Jeff Donnelly: Just first, I want to follow up, I guess, on Harry's question. How much of the market share gains that you saw in the first quarter were attributable to the Embassy Suites and Hampton renovations? And do you think that's going to be sustained through 2019? And maybe how much was measurably, or can you measurably, I guess, account for that came from the Marriott-Starwood integration, maybe challenges they might have faced in Q1?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. The answer will be the same. We have no idea on that. The nice thing about Smith Travel is it's wonderful data that we get. It's really good and accurate data as it relates to us. We have no clue because we get no data as it relates to anybody else. So we don't know where it comes from. Arguably, it's coming from a lot of places. And with the gains we had in the first quarter, it's hard to believe it didn't come from some big competitors. But we don't know. In terms of what we think of Embassy in Hampton, I would say scientific, a small amount of it ultimately in the first quarter came from that. We were, we've been working very hard on share. I'm not going to say that when we started the quarter, we thought we'd get 230 basis points of share. We didn't. We were planning on share gains. They were a little heavier than that, than we thought. I wouldn't expect that we would maintain that level of share gains for the whole year. We certainly have an objective, as we always do, to gain share. As I said, we gained 1 point globally last year. I think we've gained share, everyone in the last 12 years. When you're at 114 plus and already have industry-leading market share, moving share is hard. 230 points is really, really hard. So I would not expect that for the full year, but I would certainly expect that we will have share gains.
Kevin Jacobs: And Jeff, I'd just add that in terms of, yes, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, Embassy in Hampton are benefiting from coming out of renovations. Not in all cases, but in a lot of cases, if the renovation is large scale, those totals aren't even in the share numbers. So the share numbers we've been quoting are same store on the same comp set. So it's really not, that's not really what's driving. And we did gain share across the board and in all brands. So it's pretty, it's really not isolated to those renovations. And then the other thing I'd say is in those brands and a couple of others, we still have a bunch of those hotels that are still under renovation. So we have ones that are coming out, but we still have, in some cases, up to 25% of the portfolio in the U.S. that are still under renovation. So that benefit should continue. But again, that's really not what's driving same-store sales, same-store RevPAR index gains.
Jeff Donnelly: Okay. And just maybe one follow-up is you guys certainly continue to enjoy hefty signings, particularly this quarter. But the last several quarters, cost of construction particularly in the U.S. has been outstripping EBITDA growth or cash flow yield growth for owners. So what in your view allows new build growth to continue to remain so robust when effectively in the last 6 to 8 quarters, you would think it's becoming marginally more unappealing to a developer just given the economics of the way things are moving?
Chris Nassetta: I think that's fair to say, but then I think that is exactly right. The other thing that's been going on, in addition to cost increases that have been going at a pretty high rate, is that debt availability in the market has been declining. Now it's been, it declined for us, been relatively stable but a lot less debt available than you had seen a couple of years ago. So I think you put less money together with higher cost to build then obviously, it has an impact because the economics don't work as well. We are actually, and so if you look at the market data, I think you're seeing less stuff generally going to construction. If you look at our data for the first quarter and what we think for the full year, we think we will put a pretty decent amount more percentage-wise under construction in the U.S. this year as compared to last. And so the question back to your core question, why, I think that's because our brands are, there are some stuff that's always going to get done, and just call it what it is, our brands are outperforming. They're driving higher market share. So people have businesses. Part of the business is developing properties. If you have very high market share even in a high-cost environment where money is a little more expensive, you can still get your yield. You're going to build it, but you're going to do it where you can get the yield, and that's going to be where you get the premium market share, and we have the premium market share. So I, we think we'll be, rooms under construction for us will be up in the low double digits this year, at least that's what our government forecasting suggests, and the first quarter was consistent with that.
Operator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen: Just following up on that net unit growth question. So net unit growth in the first quarter was up 6.9%. If my model is right, I think that's your highest growth since you went public. So congrats on that. Does that suggest there's some upward pressure on the 6.5% guidance for the year? And then on your pipeline growth, it was up 4.5%. So it's slightly lower than your NUG growth. How do you kind of translate that over? And would you expect that to kind of accelerate? Or do you expect that to decelerate as we go through the year?
Chris Nassetta: All good questions. And yes, it's true. I mean, we give you quarterly data because we report on a quarterly basis. But I would not read too much into the quarter-by-quarter in any of these metrics because it just depends on the cadence of things and holidays and how many workdays are in a quarter, et cetera. I think our expectation is what we said. We're going to deliver in the middle of the 6% to 7% range. I think actually, last year, we did have a surge at the end of the year on things that we thought would deliver at the beginning of this year. So I think we ended up at 7% last year for the record.
Kevin Jacobs: Trailing 12 months for Q4 and Q1, about the same at [roundabout].
Chris Nassetta: I think that doesn't mean that something can't, like last year happened where we had stuff fall into the quarter and get done a little sooner or a little later. I think we're comfortable with the 6.5%.
Thomas Allen: And then just on the pipeline growth coming in slightly slower than the NUG growth, is that something to think about?
Chris Nassetta: No. Again, quarter-to-quarter, I think our signings this year, again, forecasted signings will set a record this year.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi.
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you now that there's a couple of large companies that are moving into the home-sharing business. Obviously, Marriott made its announcement yesterday. Is that something that you could see Hilton entering at some point? Or what are your thoughts overall on that?
Chris Nassetta: I'm shocked I got asked that question, actually. That is something we have, not kidding, of course. I figured we'd get asked. So that's something we've talked about on a bunch of prior quarterly calls and certainly spent a lot of time thinking about it, understanding here at Hilton. I think the short answer is at the moment, that's not something that we're pursuing. The longer answer is, which is consistent with my prior commentary is we fundamentally think that home-sharing is a different business. What we think we're in the business of is providing high-quality, consistent, branded experiences. That means taking products at all these various price points that have exactly the functionality that customers want, the amenities they want. We wrap it in incredible service. We also connect it all by loyalty. And as a result, we get a big premium because of the consistent high-quality nature of all these price points. Our belief is that home-sharing is just something different. It's not that it's a bad business. We just think it's a different staycation, a higher beta experience and not the premium value proposition. We've spent a lot of time talking to our customers, and what our customers effectively at the moment tell us, and by the way, this could change, and our view could change. But our customers tell us they don't need this from us. They have places they can get this. They don't need it from us. And in a sense, they don't want it from us, which I found surprising. But that's what customers will say to us. So at the moment, what we, as you can tell from the prepared comments and the Q&A so far, I'm a big believer in focus. We have a lot of really good things going on. We have a lot of momentum where the market share leader now. We think that there's opportunity to extend that lead. And so we want to be focused on delivering high-quality, consistent, branded experiences in a broader and broader network to take quality, curated platform and continue to grow it in a way that customers can really rely on us to deliver great experiences. So at the moment, no. We're going to keep doing what we're doing where we think we're having great success.
Smedes Rose: That's helpful. I just wanted to ask you, too. So you talked about Signia a little bit more this call. For the properties that are converting to that brand, I mean, so, well, we know a little bit about Bonnet Creek because it's owned by a REIT, but the other ones, are the owners putting in money to expand the group space that's there? Or is there something new that's really driven by group demand? Or is this just a way of kind of rolling up?
Chris Nassetta: The bulk of Signia, by the way, the first 3 deals, and we got a bunch of other deals we're working on, Bonnet is the only conversion with some expansion of meeting space and the renovation and upgrading of the hotel next to the Waldorf Astoria and Bonnet Creek. The other 2 are new builds part of convention centers. So they are purpose built, modern, the best modern design of meeting space, technology, et cetera. One in Indianapolis next to the convention center, the other in Atlanta actually. And we're doing it with the Georgia World Congress in the center there right next to Mercedes Stadium, a spectacular sight. And I suspect there may be other potential conversions. But the bulk of this brand over time is going to be new build. It's not conversion.
Operator: The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays.
Anthony Powell: Can you talk about how your group production for future quarters trended in the quarter? Did they show any softness like you saw in corporate transient in March? Or was that the system with prior quarters?
Kevin Jacobs: Generally consistent, Anthony. I think our position is a little bit, a touch lower this, at the end of this quarter than it was at the end of the fourth quarter, which would imply that pace was down for the quarter. But that's normal for as you go in, as you get into the year, the bulk of the year is spoken for in terms of capacity and bookings. And so as you get further into the year, the position tends to migrate down to where you're going to realize for the year. So it was technically a bit softer, but that was to be expected. And we still think the group will be the strongest of the 3 segments as well.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. And the position on the books right now supports where we think we'll end up from a forecasting point of view in group RevPAR gains.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, all within expectations.
Chris Nassetta: All the lines.
Anthony Powell: Got it. And capital allocation question focused on the dividend. It's been $0.15 a quarter for the past few quarters even as EPS and your stock price has gone up. I think you've talked about keeping your competitive yield. Is that still the case? And can we see a dividend increase this year?
Kevin Jacobs: I don't know. We just kept it the same, as you pointed out. So we'd have to talk to our Board about any increases as well. But I don't think we would intend to increase it. I mean, the way Chris talked about earlier in the Q&A session, we like the returns on buying out the stock. We think that having the dividend is important. It attracts yield investors. We're not getting a lot of feedback from investors about the level of the dividend and that they think it should be higher. And frankly, we think we drive higher equity returns by taking the incremental dollar and buying back more stock.
Chris Nassetta: I think that's right. If you look at it over the long term, we were thinking about how do we drive outperformance over the next 5 or 10 years. If you model it, I think it's a very convincing model that says allocate as much of our return of capital to buybacks as we can given the strength and resiliency of the underlying model. So that's what we're doing, and I wouldn't expect any increases anytime soon on dividends.
Operator: The next question will be from David Katz of Jefferies.
David Katz: Congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to just go back to Smedes' question and your answer just a little bit. I recognize that there is a boundary and perhaps a slippery slope where getting into the sort of shared economy in some way is contiguous to what you do, right? And on the one side of the argument is, hey, our customers are doing this, but they're also, like, driving cars, it doesn't mean you should be selling those. But there is an argument that is impacting share in some way, right? That it is impacting the ability to charge for that last room under certain circumstances and so forth. Do you see that barrier over time changing? Or is this just for now, it's just not, it's a different business, not something we want to be in?
Chris Nassetta: I think it's the latter. I mean, and I tried to say it in my long-winded response. It's not something that we have, that's in concrete. I mean, this is fast-moving sort of the view of the sharing economy broadly and certainly as it relates to our industry. That's why I say, I always start with we spent a lot of time on it because we have. And so it's a dynamic thing as we see what other folks are doing competitively, not just the folks that are in our industry directly but other new entrants or Airbnb or VRBO or anybody else. We're watching it very carefully, and we'll judge it over time. As we judge it today, which is the question that I believe I got asked, I gave you my answer, which is we do not believe it justifies our entry into the space at the moment and that we should take our focus away from the things that we're working on that are going well.
Operator: The next question will be from Gregory Miller of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
Gregory Miller: I'm on the line for Patrick Scholes. Looking at the international growth markets for hotels, a lot of the focus in Asia Pacific is on China. Heading South a bit, where do you see India today from the development landscape? How the pipeline is trending given the current GDP growth in that country?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, we obviously are very active in India. I was just there, I don't know, a few weeks, maybe it was a little bit longer ago than that and get there multiple times a year. We have a fabulous team there, and we're making really good progress. We have sort of, I mean, in a relative sense to our scale and to the size of the population, we are quite small in India. I think we have circa 20 hotels open. We've got another, more than that in the pipeline or in production in various ways. I think given you have 1.3 billion people, the economy is growing at a strong rate, and they are really transforming their economy. It's a place you got to be, you want to be, both from like China from the standpoint of the business in India but also from the standpoint of outbound business coming out of India to the rest of the world. If that economy grows just like every other economy, they're going to go traveling around the world, and we want them to have loyalty to our brand. So we are making, I would say, really good progress from sort of a standing start years ago. It's slow going, I think, for all of us in the industry, but an important market and one that we are investing in with a great team and with great relationships with the cadre of Honors that are doing, that are building us fantastic products. We opened a couple of luxury hotels in there in the last few years, and they're doing really well, the Conrad in Pune and the Conrad in Bangalore that are real iconic properties to help, in addition to some Hilton hotels sort of build our presence there. But you will continue to see us grinding in India and over time, getting bigger and bigger in that market because it's an important market for our network effect. But it will not move as quickly, notwithstanding some of the reforms in the economic growth. It will not move anytime soon as quickly as other markets around the world, including China, just because it's a much more laborious sort of process to, from start to finish to get a hotel in the operation.
Gregory Miller: And just a follow-up going back on the domestic market, I want to ask you about Tru. I know you had a number of hotels that are open and strong initial rollout. I'm curious if you have taken some potentially initial customer feedback and made some revisions to the prototype or planned versions to prototype now that you're continuing to progress along with that brand expansion.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, we have, Greg. I mean, as is typical for us when we, when you actually launch, you get real-life feedback versus just creating the hotel in a lab and guessing as to what customers are going to think, although we're pretty good at that as well. But I think the biggest thing we did was we added a desk, so that's a good example of feedback where we've gotten a lot of customer feedback through the process of creating the brand that people like to hang out in their beds and use their laptops, and they don't need their desks. They don't need the desk. It turns out they do. And then we made changes to the F&B program, particularly the breakfast offering, as we got feedback from customers. So it's all going really well. We've got over 60 of them open now. We think we'll have another 60 open this year. And we've got over, well over 500 working deals and growing, and so everything is going great.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS.
Robin Farley: I've been hopping around between calls, so I don't think that you gave this color, but I apologize if you did. I know your fee revenue was up 12%, and that is more than maybe unit and RevPAR growth would suggest. I think you mentioned that licensing fees were a driver. But can you go into a little bit more detail in terms of is that credit card fees higher? Or were there contract cancellation fees? And then I assume that, that $10 million of timing items, is that why the Q2 fee guidance is like a little bit below the full year run rate?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Good question, Robin. We actually haven't been asked that thus far, and I did talk about it in prepared remarks, but you might have been on that other call then. But yes, $10 million of timing items is really largely one fee related to a property that's being redeveloped in New York, and it's a rather large property that's being redeveloped. Hopefully, we'll be a part of that redevelopment. But for now, the building is coming down, so we would do a rather large payment there. So that was the large, largely the timing out. And then the core beat was driven by license fees across the board, a little, mostly with the credit card fees, and so that accounted for the beat. And then, yes, the timing of them, obviously, carries over into the second quarter. We left our fee guidance at 7% to 9% for the year. Obviously, if we had about $20 million of increases in EBITDA coming in and RevPAR the same, that $20 million is largely going into the fee segment. So our expectations for the fee segment are higher, but they still ended up within the range. And with a little bit of rounding, we decided to leave it at 7% and 9%. Does that cover your question?
Robin Farley: No, that's great. And just to clarify, the higher credit card fees in Q1 was, so without the full year rates is maybe some like a nonrecurring factor maybe just like an increase in...
Kevin Jacobs: No. No. Credit card fees outperform in the first quarter. And actually, we think we, actually, that was part of the increase in the core increase in guidance. It was partially operational with some of the things that Chris mentioned earlier with performance in Japan and a little bit of performance in greater London. But some of it was credit card fees as well.
Robin Farley: Okay. No, that's great. And just one small thing. The difference in your EPS guidance before and after special items, one went up a few cents, one went down a few cents. What was that other expense or that piece of special? Because the special item that, and I think you don't normally guide to that, but that was a bit more than it was a quarter ago. So just wondering if...
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. The, after special items is really at this point what we would have you focus on for a bunch of reasons historically but even more so now post revenue recognition. So the special items increase was really commensurate with the increase in our overall guidance. And then EPS, I think what you're talking about EPS for the quarter was a little bit light, and that relates to the other management franchise fees line item, which is the reimbursables from the hotels and the various funded programs. Post revenue recognition, those, we have not been able to equalize those, so we run through revenues as incurred. We run through expenses as incurred. And so in some quarters, that's going to be a benefit. In some quarters, it's going to be harm. And so that, and we neutralized that in special items, and so that's why the special items guidance is more in concert with our overall changes in guidance.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: We'll make this short because I know there are other calls going on. Appreciate your time today. We're obviously pleased with the first quarter. I think we had some good momentum going into the rest of the year. We look forward to talking with everybody after we complete the second quarter. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2019-02-13 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. We're happy to report a good finish to what was a great year for Hilton. In the fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. We continue to prove the resiliency of our business model as net unit growth exceeded our expectations and drove the majority of our bottom line and free cash flow growth. We also continue to demonstrate the power of our network effect by increasing our industry leading market share premiums 100 basis points for the full year with all regions gaining share. Exceptional experiences for our guest drive better profits for our owners, generating higher returns for our shareholders. Speaking of returns for the full year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends representing approximately 9% of our market cap.  Turning to results, our system-wide RevPAR grew 3% for the year. Group business performed well throughout the year with RevPAR growth of 4%, slightly exceeding our expectations given particular strength in convention business across a number of key markets. Corporate transient trends were healthy with RevPAR up 2.6% for the year with some softness experienced in the fourth quarter. Leisure transient continue to grow, also up 2.6% for the year that fell shy of our expectations given greater than expected impact from events and calendar shifts and a bit of softer demand in the later part of the year. Looking to the year ahead we expect similar to modestly slower trends versus what we saw in full year 2018. Macro indicators continue to support generally favorable fundamentals and a good backdrop for continued pricing increases despite modest deceleration in GDP expectations versus prior estimates. Group trends are solid with 2019 bookings up in the mid-single digits and corporate negotiated rates are up just over 2% slightly ahead of last year's growth. Given the modestly lower macro forecasts coupled with uncertainties in some international markets, we're adjusting our full year RevPAR guidance range to 1% to 3%. An area of the business where we continue to have greater visibility is net unit growth. Our strategic approach to development has allowed us to establish one of the largest and most diversified systems and pipelines in the industry. In 2018, we opened more than one hotel per day and had the best year of openings in our history, adding over 450 hotels and achieving net unit growth of nearly 57,000 rooms or approximately 7% growth year-over-year. We ended the year with roughly 5,700 properties and 913,000 rooms across 113 countries and territories. It was also a record year for construction starts and signings. During 2018, we started construction on more than 83,000 rooms, the best year in our history. We signed 108,000 rooms marking our fourth consecutive year of signings over 100,000 rooms and are on track for another year of record signings with increases expected across both U.S. and international markets. We remain focused on building a presence everywhere in the world our guests want to travel. With more than half of our pipeline located outside the United States and 35 new countries represented, we have tremendous opportunities to grow our global footprint for the foreseeable future. Roughly 30% of our pipeline is located in Asia Pacific, a region that continues to benefit from powerful long-term secular trends supported by a growing middle class in China. In the fourth quarter we celebrated the opening of our 50th Hampton by Hilton in China with an additional 200 in the pipeline. We also debuted our accessible lifestyle brand in the region with the opening of the Canopy by Hilton Chengdu City Center. With more than 75% of our pipeline in Asia Pacific under construction, we expect to open approximately 20,000 rooms in the region in 2019 and achieve roughly 20% net unit growth. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa region accounts for nearly 20% of our pipeline and has an increasing number of Hilton Honors members driving demand for our products. In particular we continue to gain great traction with our newer brands and expect positive momentum to continue with the recent launches of Motto, our urban lifestyle micro hotel brand; and LXR, our luxury collection brand. We celebrated several milestone openings in the region last quarter including the Hilton Beirut downtown, the Lincoln Plaza London, Curio; and we look forward to celebrating the opening of our first LXR property in Europe, the Biltmore, Mayfair in London in the coming weeks, as well as adding several other unique properties to the collection in the coming year. In the United States we continue to focus on serving guests for every stay occasion across a variety of price points. In the fourth quarter we celebrated the opening of our 50th Tru hotel, continuing its momentum as the fastest hotel launch in industry history. This year we expect to open another 75 of the 500 hotels in the pipeline and under development. We're also thrilled to welcome the Waldorf Astoria Atlanta Buckhead to our system during the quarter. This exciting addition enhances the brand's presence on the East Coast and brings our total luxury and lifestyle portfolio to 73 properties open globally with another 73 in the pipeline. For the full year we gained over 14 million new Honors members, bringing total membership to 85 million at year end, up approximately 20% year-over-year. Growth is coming from every major region of the world with roughly 40% of members coming from outside the United States. Our Honors members now account for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy, which is up 200 basis points for the full year. We expect continuous enhancements to our Honors program coupled with innovations like Digital Key and Connected Room, to continue to drive more direct relationships with our guests. Since its launch in 2015, we have scaled Digital Key to more than 4,100 properties globally and guests have opened more than 40 million doors to date, using the app based feature. We also rolled out over 1,800 Connected Rooms with plans to bring the technology to approximately 300 hotels by the end of 2019 enabling guests to create more personalized travel experiences through our partnerships with Netflix and Showtime and other customization features. Last November in preparation for celebrating our 100th anniversary this year, we announced the release of research that showed the positive impact Hilton has had on the people and communities we serve. Thanks to the Hilton effect, during the first 100 years we welcomed 3 billion guests, employed 10 million team members and contributed $1 trillion in total economic impact to the world. As we prepare to celebrate our centennial, we are optimistic about what the future holds for Hilton and believe we are well positioned to continue driving growth ahead of industry trends. For 2019, we expect RevPAR growth together with strong net unit growth to drive significant free cash flow generation, enabling us to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy and to continue delivering returns for shareholders. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin, to get into more details in the quarter and our outlook for the year ahead.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris, and good morning everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, at the lower end of our guidance range. Lower than anticipated growth in transient largely due to softer leisure demand across the U.S. and Asia Pacific regions weighed on results. Group RevPAR exceeded our expectations increasing nearly 4%. We estimate the calendar shifts and weather events tempered system-wide RevPAR growth by roughly 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $544 million exceeded the high-end of our guidance range, increasing 12% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better than expected licensees and upside across our ownership portfolio given RevPAR gains in London and continental Europe. In the quarter, Management franchise fees increased 14% to $532 million, ahead of our expected 9% to 11% range as results continue to benefit from strong net unit growth and better performance from our co-brand and credit card program. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.79 also beat expectations. Turning to our regional performance and outlook; fourth quarter comparable U.S. Re PAR grew 1.1% entirely driven by ADR growth. Solid group trend supported results but growth was somewhat tempered by softer transient given the weather and calendar related disruption. Our full year 2018 U.S. RevPAR grew 2.2%, given expected upticks in performance in group and business transient and consistent levels of performance in leisure transient. For full year 2019, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth consistent with our system-wide guidance range based on expected steady fundamentals and continued pricing increases. In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew 6.9% versus the prior year, given an uptick in trends across Mexico coupled with strong ADR growth in Canada, similar to trends throughout the year. For full year 2018 RevPAR grew 6.1% in the region and we expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth to be in a range consistent with our system-wide guidance. RevPAR in Europe grew 7.2% in the quarter driven by stronger than anticipated transient trends particularly in London as increased U.S. travel to the U.K. boosted results. For the full year RevPAR in Europe outperformed expectations increasing 6.9% as a result of strong transient gains most notably in Vienna and London. We expect full year 2019 RevPAR growth in Europe to be consistent with our system-wide range given continued strength in transient trends in markets like Turkey partially offset by tough comps in Russia following last year's World Cup and uncertainty surrounding Brexit. In the Middle East and Africa region RevPAR was slightly positive in the quarter. Similar to trends we saw on prior quarters leisure transient gains in Egypt were largely offset by declines in the Arabian Peninsula due to supply demand imbalances. For full year 2018 RevPAR was up 1.8% in the region. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be roughly flat given weaker than expected inbound travel to Egypt and continued softness in the Arabian Peninsula. In the Asia Pacific region RevPAR increased 3.4% in the quarter following a broader slowdown in leisure transient demand stemming in part from decelerating inbound travel coupled with impacts from weather conditions and natural disasters. Softening domestic leisure demand in China also weighed on growth in the quarter with RevPAR up just over 5%. For full year 2018 RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region grew 6.5% largely driven by strength in China particularly in the first half of the year. In China RevPAR increased approximately 10% for the full year. For full year 2019 we expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the mid single-digit range with mid to high single-digit RevPAR growth in China accounting for continued deceleration in economic growth. Moving to guidance for full year 2019, we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EBITDA of 2.24 billion to $2.29 billion representing a year over increase of approximately 8% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items and under are updated definition of $3.66 to $3.78. For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $470 million to $490 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.73 to $0.78. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate future share repurchase. Moving on the capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 a share during the fourth quarter for a total of $181 million in dividends for the year. For the full year 2018, we were returned $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. In the first quarter, our Board authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share. For 2019, we expect to return between $1.3 billion and $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details of our fourth quarter and full year results in our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up related to your question. Denise can we have our first question please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: I’ll just start off with a question on pipeline and room's growth and certainly RevPAR growth. Obviously the room’s growth in the fourth quarter was much stronger than what we had modeled and if you look at the pipeline at the end of the year was down a little bit sequentially. How much of that pipeline - that sequential pipeline decrease is a function of just more rooms opening up and to what extent is it just calling of some of the stuff that's under construction. We can understand the pipeline change a little bit better?
Chris Nassetta: Yes it's a combination of things Joe but a good question and one that we've been getting a lot so I'm glad you asked it and happy to answer it. First, I would look at the full year because quarter to quarter there's always noise going on if you look at the full year pipeline was up 6%. We would fully expect as we think about this year and we go through this year that we will again and the year with pipeline up it may vary quarter-to-quarter but we think directionally it will go up. I think in the fourth quarter two things happened both of which you noted. We came in much harder on deliveries which was great which was why net unit growth instead of being in the mid 6s ended up basically at 7. But you know the downside of that is it comes out of the pipeline when it is delivered of course when it delivered they're paying us fee. So we'd much rather get into that state and in the pipeline. And then we always - throughout the year in this case at the end of the year sort of look at everything its under construction and things that we don't think are going to really happen over reasonable period of time we clean those up. And so it's a combination of those two things. And the second part of that's an important not nuance in a sense because when we clean those up and get them out of the pipeline it allows us an opportunity to replace those deals. If you leave deals in the pipeline that aren’t going to happen you sort - you’ve taken a location at a place. So we try and be really diligent we're great with our owners if they need a little bit more time obviously we try and work with them. But at a point where we think it's not really, not going to happen we want to get it out. So it's a combination of those things again 6% up year-over-year I would think when we end the year certainly based on what we're seeing you will see sequential improvement year-over-year through 2019.
Joe Greff: And then my follow up both you Chris and Kevin referenced that later in the fourth quarter later in the year you saw some leisure transient softness and you reference it in the U.S. and China. Can you talk about that and how much of it may be driven by one-time things that were disruptive to travel versus something that's more macro in nature. Can you help us understand maybe what some of the drivers there were…
Chris Nassetta: The bigger decline that you saw if you look across the world in leisure transient were in China for the reasons that I think are pretty obvious in terms of both trade war issues, as well as the slower economy as well as some weather related things that were going on. We did see some of it in other regions as well Middle East, Africa we saw some weakness in leisure transient. And in the U.S., I would say was reasonably modest and in the U.S. And I would say not to avoid the questions. Looking at the end of the year even looking into January it’s very difficult particularly at the end of the year with all the noise related to the overlapping weather issues, the change in day of week year-over-year as well the holiday shifts. As much as I'd love to say I can give you really scientific hard stats on exactly what happened with leisure transient at the end of the year and in January it's just hard to do. I would say we didn't see a dramatic difference. If you look at the full year it's interesting we went into the year I think on this call last year we said here is what we think is going to happen we think group is going to pick up because it's getting stronger and we have a great position. You'll remember in 2017 we had quite a dynamic year as industry in corporate transient we said we think we're going to see nice pickup coming out of tax reform. And we think leisure transient is generally going to hang in there. Basically that's exactly what happened for the full year. At the end of the year when you got into the third quarter to a degree and definitely in fourth quarter with all the noise on holidays and weather impacts, it just the data got very garbled and it got very choppy. So I think time will tell. I think our view is that the guidance of one to three is that you know group is hanging in there really well. I think if there's an expectation that you're going to have broader economic growth that is still good in the U.S. and good around the world. But a little bit less than what people thought a quarter ago that that will ultimately mean that both leisure and business transient will be a little bit less then what we might have experienced last year. And that sort of baked into the 1 to 3 guidance that we gave.
Operator: The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: I just have one and I appreciate the comments on the call thus far. With respect to the capital return, the range that you guys have provided is a little bit wider and acknowledging that there were one primary but really two exogenous events that kind of beefed up your buyback in 2018. As you think about the range for 2019 with respect to the buyback and excluding the dividends, what do you - other than kind of the leverage profile that that you're looking to target, how are you guys kind of thinking about within that range what are the key drivers of being towards the high end as opposed to the lower end?
Chris Nassetta: It's a good question. I'll start with the range. Yes, the range is you know obviously we gave it, so you can see it's $500 million. Actually it's only a touch larger - only a touch wider than the range we started out with last year. And at the end of the day it's a quarter of a total leverage on our EBITDA base, not even not even a quarter of a turn leverage. And so the way we thought about giving guidance was we set the mid-point at 3.25x leverage. So, if the EBITDA forecast - based on the EBITDA forecast we have and the capital return at the mid-point that would leave us at 3.25x at the end of the year which as you know is at the mid-point of our stated range of 3x to 3.5x. And so - and then what we try to do is bracket it at a quarter of return 250 on each side from there. And you're right, we did have a couple of events - opportunities last year to buyback an outsized amount of stock and bring a little bit of stock buybacks forward into the earlier part of the year and that combined with a little bit of extra cash we had at the time enabled us to lean in on particularly on the HNA transaction. And so as the year plays out, this year we're given a little bit of a wider range and it'll be the same type of analysis. If we see opportunities to buy little more, we might do a little more, if we don't like the way the world is headed or how we feel about the outlook for the economy, we might do a little bit less.
Operator: The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please ago ahead.
Harry Curtis: A quick follow-up on Joe's question. Wanted to get a little bit more detail on the pipeline in China; does it stand to reason that as their economy slows that the pipeline resale should slow as well?
Chris Nassetta: And the reason, yes. That is not what our experience has been to date. Our pipeline - we believe in China is in good shape and we believe is continuing to grow, talk with the team's multiple times a week and we still have a lot of activity. The nature of the activity as has been discussed on a number of prior calls has definitely been shifting more towards mid-market opportunities than higher end opportunities. We're still certainly doing a bunch of Hilton's and Waldorfs and Conrads and DoubleTree's and even Embassy now. But more of the bulk is shifting to mid-market, and China for us right now that really is Hampton by Hilton and Hilton Garden Inn. That stands the reason because what's going on is growth in the middle class, they want to travel and that's what they can afford. So I think we continue to see now the bulk of the pipeline growth coming from that. And so far so good, the relationship with Plateno is working out well, they continue to actually ramp up their activities. So, yes, I mean if the China economy slows down - continues to slow and stays growing at a slower pace, I do think at some point it will have - it has to have a ripple effect. But I want to be clear that we really haven't seen it. We delivered in China last year about 11,000 rooms and that was up close to 50% from the prior year and based on what's in the cooker right now that I'm pretty darn confident will happen, we'll be up another 30%, 33% this year. And some of those are short - relatively short gestation because the Hampton Inn opportunities move fast. I mean they're moving through the pipeline in 12 or 18 months sort of time frame. So, so far so good but China will have ups and downs just to be clear just like every other market in the world. The long-term trend is up and if you draw a line through it over the next 20 or 30 years is definitely going up but they'll have the ups and downs just like the U.S. pipeline and deliveries to. But right now we're in pretty good shape I think for the next probably two years given what we have in the pipeline and what sort of - and already under construction in addition to now having conversion opportunities which is kind of a new thing in China. I think we'll do more conversions this year in China than we've ever done. I think we're feeling very good about the next couple of years in China.
Harry Curtis: And then the follow-up question is, you're making some nice progress on development of the luxury portfolio. Can you walk us through what that pipeline looks like and where you are today and thinking ahead maybe two to four years where you're likely to go with the luxury portfolio?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, we are. Thank you for saying it. We're very proud of what we've been doing in luxury. We've been added for a long time. I've been here 11 going on 12 years and one of the first things that we started working on when I got here is making sure that we had the aspirational product in the portfolio for all of our customers and importantly our most loyal customers in Honors. That's the kind of product they want. As we've been doing it the old fashioned way. We have not been out buying things. I suspect that is not something that will be in our future because there's nothing that really we think is really possible. And so we've been grinding it out and doing it the right way and in focusing on both the existing brands of Conrad and Waldorf but also with adding brands to the portfolio importantly LXR which we talked about earlier, Canopy in the lifestyle space and the possibility of other things that are in the skunkworks right now that would add to our luxury lifestyle brand portfolio. And I would say – my believe that I've been at it now as long as I've been here as I said is that we've really hit stride in the sense of. We have become the fastest growing luxury brands or the major players and we are starting now to really be able to find ourselves with both Conrad and Waldorf and Canopy in the right locations in the right cities both from an urban and resort point of view to where we're creating a real distribution network that matters. I think these are brands that are really starting to resonate based on the research that we do with our customer base and more broadly. And I think the next as much as I think we've hit stride. I think over the next three to five years you're going to see some pretty amazing things happening within both these brands. We're getting ready to open up a spectacular new Conrad in Washington DC, Downtown DC in the next 30 days. I was just in Waldorf, New York last Monday doing the model room review that is if you look in that building there is a lot going on that's happening. We're hopeful that that's going to deliver in 2021 and it will absolutely be a spectacular product. Couple a weeks ago I was touring the under construction Waldorf in London. In the Admiralty Arch building facing Buckingham Palace which will be an absolute jewel box and a whole bunch of others that are coming that really add to what is a growing, but very special portfolio. So I feel really good about where we are. I mean technically in Waldorf today we have 31 hotels. We've got another 19 in the pipeline. I mentioned a couple of those similar statistics for Conrad, 33 opened and 19 in the pipeline and great things happening. San Francisco, I mean I won't go through the whole list. But suffice to say, we've looked at the world and figured out like where our customer, where our luxury customer wants to be and we are hard at work if we're not already there in making sure that we get there in a relatively short period of time. So I think it's working, I think if we look at the share numbers in those brands they've been growing at a really nice pace. What our customers are telling us is very positive and I think we're really starting to hit stride.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Chris, I just wanted to go back to China for a quick moment and one thing we've seen in the data is that Hilton continues to pretty meaningfully outperform some of the broader industry data in China as it relates to what we've see in RevPAR in that market. I'm sure this has to do with probably a variety of different mix factors, but when you guys kind of look at your own experience I mean could you just help us maybe pass the part a little bit. Do you think you're benefiting from city mix, market share gains, brand mix, ramp up of new properties, what's helping drive some of the strength that we're seeing there? Just on overall absolute basis, I do understand that it obviously slowed sequentially?
Chris Nassetta: As I would say but a lot thing, it's a combination of things. It's not any one thing but I think the properties that we're opening are spectacular properties in really good locations. We've been incredibly disciplined about what we're doing, who we're doing it with, what markets, what brands to get it right, and that is helping us. If you look at market share numbers, our market share numbers are growing at a very rapid pace. I don't have the exact China number but in APAC we grew market share numbers which would be driven largely by China almost 300 basis points. APAC overall we are now driving system-wide market share of 115, and China would be comparable to that. By the way that eclipse is our U.S. market share which also grew in the year. So we are driving great properties, great commercial delivery, driving great performance that is taking share from the competition. There is also in fact even though that you're looking at comp numbers, many of the you know in China particularly at the upper end less so at the lower, but if you look at like DoubleTree and above, the ramp periods in China are longer than you would find in the United States as an example. And so we do get the benefit even though year-over-year these are comp and they've been in the system they're still ramping in a way that is more significant than you would find in other parts of the world. So we are clearly getting a benefit in that regard to. But the largest part of it honestly is we're driving huge amounts of share growth.
Shaun Kelley: And I mean it's interesting on the share growth, so then just a follow-up with that. I mean you mentioned location being a critical factor there. Is there also a piece of this that's critical mass of brand awareness I mean I think if we were to rewind a decade ago it almost probably a little in a different places it would relate to sort of maybe brand awareness in China but obviously been super aggressive there. So is that a piece of it or, and kind of how would you measure that or look at that?
Chris Nassetta: Definitely, I mean our brand awareness has always been pretty good honestly but it is much, much better. So it's partly that. It's also commercial infrastructure. We made the decision years ago like you know five, seven years ago to probably more than that probably seven to nine years ago relatively early in my tenure even though we didn't have many hotels that we were going to invest in the commercial infrastructure to make sure that we build the neural network to deliver commercially for our owners. Because if you want to grow there and we're using third-party money and you open a bunch of hotels and they don’t do well and they tell their friends you know it doesn't really work out so well. So we sort of invested ahead of the growth curve remembering 11 years ago like when we had five hotels in China. So we had a very small business. Fast forward today you know opening in the pipeline we've got you know 450, 500 hotels. So we knew what was coming and we said even in back in our private days we need to invest ahead of that right. Now we've grown into it obviously with the scaling of the business but we built critical commercial infrastructure there to allow us to deliver. In addition to having the right properties with the right owners, and the right locations and having brands that resonate. There's a whole bunch of investment that's gone on over time in the commercial delivery.
Operator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Just in terms of distribution you highlighted that you had seen a good increase in loyalty member distribution. But could you just talk about the mix between OTA's, property direct, call centers et cetera and how that's shifting? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: I mean I think the short answer on that is, as you can see with our latest campaigns with Anna Kendrick and a whole bunch of other things we're very focused on driving direct relationships and direct business. And if you look at our web-direct channels, they remain the fastest growing channels that we have and growing at a much faster rate than OTA channels. Now we still believe there is a lot more that we can do. As we have said our book-direct efforts which are more than marketing. There's a marketing element to it but making sure that the value proposition is the most compelling value proposition from the standpoint of how we price our products. From the standpoint of the technology and the other things that enable a better experience for folks that are part of our Honor system and have a direct relationship. We are going to – we are in a mode of we're going to constantly be reinvesting and focusing on that. So that will be an always on effort, but it's working and if you look at the numbers for the year our web-direct channels of all types grew three times the rate of other channels.
Thomas Allen: And then you highlighted the strength and the credit card business in the fourth quarter. Is there way to quantify it and talk qualitatively or quantifiably how that should benefit or how that should go forward in 2019? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Thomas in the fourth quarter we had a great quarter in that program and the card products have been very well received by consumers. And it's still a relatively new program so it's starting to get its legs and ramp up. Our card signings in the quarter were up almost 25% we spend in the quarter up kind of mid single-digits. And so the way to think about that going forward is as those signings mature and we get more spend and the program gets more popular we expect that to continue increase with increases in spend next year expected to be well in excess of that mid single-digits this year. So we're very positive about the outlook for that program.
Operator: The next question will be from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Want to go back to maybe some market share data. Do you have your overall RevPAR index and how that’s trending for the portfolio your direct bookings percentage and then are your share of global hotel supply?
Chris Nassetta: Sure in terms of index here is what I gave you I shared a teeny bit of it well today pack my other comments, but I can give you across the board. So U.S. market share ended last year a little over 114% which was up 80 basis points system-wide U.S. EMEA as we have sort of three mega regions so EMEA finished the year at 116 again I think I noted on the last call given that we are a capital like business and depending on third parties to build hotels for us to continue to grow. There's no more important statistic that we look at then our market share because that's what people why people are making that investment. And for the first time ever these numbers I'm giving you are reflective of the EMEA and APAC not only having great share growth but I’ll finish giving you the numbers but eclipsing our U.S. market share. So reflective of the fact that we are now creating this network effect and have made you know have brands and enough distribution, enough commercial capabilities as I described in APAC that the whole ecosystem is working really well. So EMEA ended the year 116 up almost 200 basis points APAC ended the year at 115 up almost 300 basis points. So, if you, blend all that together a bit over 114 just given the heavy weighting of the U.S. In terms of our direct business, our direct channels represent about 75% percent of our overall business. If you look at all our web channels those represent about half of that roughly and 40% or 50% of that is sort of on our app which is a growing at a pretty astronomical rate. Obviously we like that that's where we want to continue to push as many of our loyal customers as we can that’s absolute most efficient channel. So we're really pleased with the progress there. Again lots of incremental strategies in play, which won’t get into in detail on this call to continue to give our customers even more reasons to want to go through those channels, because it's a better price, a better deal. And the experience will be better because of all of the other things they get with technology and otherwise as a result of being a member and buying that way. What was the last question…
Wes Golladay: The global hotel supply?
Chris Nassetta: Share of global supply like 5% I think something like that. So we're almost four times that in terms of share of rooms under construction in the world, last number I saw was about 5%.
Operator: And the next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: I guess as a follow up to your comments on conversions being a new thing in China and also the comments on brand awareness improving there. You mentioned in the past that conversions tend to ramp during tough backdrop and can buttress softer or new construction. But how do you think about the economics to run an independent versus a Hilton brand. And how they have evolved over the past kind of nine years of expansion and as we think about how that may dictate conversions if the environment stays challenged?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, conversions did ramp up last year. I mean we went basically from 20% low 20 and change to 25. I've said on other calls I mean we peaked through the Great Recession in the low 40s that was an unusual time. I suspect we will not get back to those kind of numbers, but I think yeah clearly as condition got a little more challenging throughout last year, financing got a little bit more difficult over the last couple of years. We've seen more conversions than I suspect we will again both because I think in the U.S. you'll see some ramp up in the opportunity. But also I suggested in APAC and certainly EMEA where we have already had those opportunities you'll see an uptick. And of course we've been adding brands to make that more possible. In the last go around and the Great Recession we basically had one core conversion brand and that was DoubleTree and it was a gift that has given us a lot. I mean it really has performed well in every regard, we still have DoubleTree but it has broader distribution. Now we have Curio, Tapestry, LXR in addition to DoubleTree. And of course we have Hilton another other opportunities as well. So we feel very good about sort of positioning ourselves to take advantage of it. I do suspect that you are in a trend you will see a trend line that is inching up from the low 20s to the mid 20s and I think I suspect it'll keep going. The value proposition at a high level is pretty straightforward. The reason to come in to the Hilton system we just talked about market is really twofold. We think in almost every case we can drive better revenues. Our system will drive better revenues, our average market share around the world is over 114% that suggests that versus the average we're driving 14% higher revenues that's a lot of revenue okay. And yes they got to pay us, but that's a lot of extra revenue to pay with. The other thing that we afford them through both our deals with all of our distribution partners as well as opportunities with our supply management function. We afford them cost energy opportunities so we believe we can significantly in most cases lower distribution costs and significantly lower the cost of they're buying certain products and services if they attach themselves to HS and Hilton supply management. And so it's a powerful combination when you put it together driving a big premium on revenue and reducing expenses means more profit and there's plenty enough we think in almost every case to pay us. Our fair share and for them to make a lot more money which is why a lot of people choose to do it.
Stephen Grambling: I guess as a very quick follow up just to make sure I heard you correctly I guess on China. Is there any reason why that trend would be different as we think about the potential for conversions…
Chris Nassetta: I think that the reason is - first of all China is weakening a little bit right. So they've been in a prolong expansionary phase and while they're still, by the way let's keep in perspective. They're still growing at 2 to 3, 2.5 times the rate of the United States and the West maybe if you put Europe in there more than that they're still growing at a good pace, but at a lower pace than they've been growing for a long time. So that one situation the other thing that's going on as you had a big boom over the last 20 years, but really over the last 10 to 15 of deals getting done and a lot of those deals are coming due. So you have relatively new hotels that have been built in the cycle where there at the end of their term of the contract. You put together a little bit weaker environment in a world where people have optionality and we're driving industry leading market share we think that bodes well for our opportunity.
Operator: The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony Powell: You mentioned the 14 million new Hilton Honors members there were lot of changes and also loyalty programs based last year. You think you may gain some mind share among loyalty focused customer at the expense of some others given some of the changes that your competitors?
Chris Nassetta: I don't - I mean it's really hard for us to know clearly we're experiencing very high growth rates we don't think by the way those growth rates are going to abate this year. Our goal is to have over 100 million members when we finish this year, and I'm highly confident that we will be able to do that. So we think that the pace will continue. We have done a bunch of stuff which you can see and that has been publicized throughout the system both the lower tiers, but particularly at the higher tiers to make the program more appealing and it's resonating. Obviously we're getting members from somewhere people that are already frequent travelers. So to some degree I suspect that we are benefiting by getting members of other programs that are shifting their loyalty. What we're focused on is really just creating as I said a hyper compelling reason why people want to be a member of our club. Like that Honors isn't just about points, Honors is about getting the best value by points by price and it's about getting unique experiences both with the technology and other ways, like our relationship with Live Nation and Formula 1 and a whole bunch of other relationships that are just things that are hard to replicate and that people experientially like and choose to sort of migrate their way towards us. So I can't give you hard data on like who is come exactly from where and to a degree as long they're great customers that we can get engaged with us, we don't care. We want them in the system. The thing that we didn't say that I'm actually most proud of, it's really important to have a big - we all focus on like we got $85 million we're going to have a $100 million and that's great, it's a big number, right. And it's growing and it's going to keep growing at a great pace. What's most important is engagement, it's like how many of those members are actually actively engaged with us that are coming, staying with us and I’m going to say I know what the number is now. I think five or six years ago I think we would have said we probably had 15% to 20% of that number that we're really engaged. Today, 50% percent; so half the 42 million so a teeny bit less than half we would view as are engaged with us. That they are actually they have recent stay activity and purchase activity, that's a big deal, right. Big numbers are great. How many people are actually buying? I mean we could auto enroll the whole world if we wanted. We could have a 1 billion people if we wanted, but that's a lot – my team doesn't like that idea. But it's really how do we get people in the program that we can get engage with us and staying with us and buying our products. And that statistic I think is really, really important one.
Anthony Powell: Got it. And I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you expect rate growth to play a bigger role in RevPAR growth of U.S. this year. That's interesting given price power has been soft recently. What gives you confidence in your ability to push rate a bit more?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I mean if you look at fourth quarter a 100% of our growth was rate. If you look at the whole year in the U.S., 80% of our RevPAR growth was rate growth. I think it will be similar this year. So that's what gives me the confidence. Now you would I think argue well but it's not a high number, and I would say you're right and – but there are other reasons for that. I think the other reasons for that which I've talked about a lot and I think it's come up on prior calls, have more to do with the fact that you're in a sort of a low compression environment. The overall economic growth is fairly tepid inflation. Throughout this period it has been fairly tepid. You've had a lot of volatility particularly in the U.S. around politics and things that create caution. And so I think as compared to prior cycles where you had much more robust broader economic growth, that sort of flowed through. So I think it's sort of stands to reason and what has been a relatively low growth environment that that's what you get. The other thing that's going on that I don't think many have focused on is what's going on is really good in the sense that – but it affects the rate growth numbers over the last several years and that is mix of business. So, if you look at the overall occupant system-wide occupancy for Hilton, we are over 300 basis points higher occupancy than we've ever been in our 100 year history. Why? The bulk of it is weekends and off peak times we've just gotten much smarter about filling up. Oh, is that good? Sure it's good because we make money. Our job is to drive returns to our owners and they are getting a rate that they make money on and their bottom line profitability on an absolute dollar basis is higher. The consequence of it though is when you look at rates it creates a scenario where that business by definition on weekends is at a lower rate. And so when you blend in that mix at a lower rate it sort of - it dilutes the story on rate growth, which I think is an illusion. Obviously, our owners and we are much better off with that incremental business even though when you blended in because its lower rated business, it sort of dilutes the rate growth story. And so I think – again, this isn't super positive for our owners that we're able to do this and we're not, we have not been of the mind that there is a big rate issue that's sort f out there. It's short of what I just said, short of mix and really a low compression environment.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: I wanted to ask about group business because I know it's probably difficult to get visibility and then there are trade wars and government shutdowns and things that you don't know when you're giving guidance. But just kind of looking at last year, it look like initially you thought group would be up mid single-digit and then there was a pointer in the year you got more conservative. You thought would be up 3 to 4 and it came in at 4. So I guess just thinking about your expectation for 2019, you talked about being up mid single-digit. Can you tell us maybe what group bookings came in Q4 versus the same time last year just so we could think about sort of a incremental like how the outlook is changing in the most recent months?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, Robin it's a good question. I think what you're referencing is earlier in the year we were talking about the business on the books being up mid single-digits which is what it was. And for fourth quarter it ended up realizing it for. So pretty close to where the book was. Our book for 2019 is also up mid single digits. That doesn't mean that that's exactly where it's going to realize because it depends on how many members of the block show up and what they decide to pay and who decides to cancel them. As you know there's a lot that goes into it, but I don't know why built into our expectations as we said is that group business will remain solid and so we'll see what the experience ends up looking like in 2019. But the business on the books is still up in the mid single-digit.
Robin Farley: And then just want to follow-up on the leisure commentary. I know you talked about some of the issues in China where the bigger declines were. But just looking at the U.S. rates, there was some modest leisure decline. If that was sort of related to weather or calendar things, can you talk about how leisure looks to the degree do you have some visibility so far for Q1 in 2019? In other words, are there – is that sort of softening, I don't want to use the word softening if it's not the word you'd use; but are you seeing about a little bit here and early 2019 as well?
Chris Nassetta: I would say it's noisy and it was noisy at the end of last year for the reasons that you highlighted. All the movements of pieces around day of week, around holiday, around the overlapping weather. And it's been noisy. It was noisy in January largely to do with the government shutdown. So again, I'm not trying to be evasive. It's hard to judge it right now. I mean to be perfectly fair we think our expectation for the year is leisure is going to be fine. That leisure is going to grow, we think it will probably grow less than last year. We think business transient will probably grow less because we have an expectation that's based on consensus view of the world that broader economic growth is going to be a little lighter. When we look at the trends that we see in January, they're noisy but we look - we can get a decent sense of February/March. We think that they are supportive of the range and outcome that I just described and that we've given you today, which would be a little bit lower than last year.
Operator: The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi I'm curious on what you're seeing out of Europe as it relates to Ford demand specially on the leisure side out of the U.K. Certainly we're getting some signals from the cruise lines or the floating hotels that some of the European based cruise brands are really seeing some difficulty as it relates to travel around Brexit I wonder what you are seeing for the hotel side?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah Patrick, I mean similar to sort of, we’re seeing a little bit on what Chris just said, it's a little bit hard to have this ability. They have their fair share noise over there with Brexit, sort of the way we've have a little bit of noise here and as you know the lead time on unlike cruise's lead time on some of our business is pretty short in that area. So we've kind of given you guidance that we think you know the region is going to be within the range, we'd expect leisure to be within that and there's a number of ways it could go. Obviously the fourth quarter was quite strong in continental Europe and London. Driven by leisure and U.S. inbound to the U.K. and to continental Europe in particular. And so there's a - those trends could continue but right now we're saying kind of within the range.
Operator: The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead
Bill Crow: Chris, if you look at the front end of growth, really talking about application volumes and construction starts, any changes in those especially as you think about your three mega regions?
Chris Nassetta: No, I mean overall it's been trending as you heard in the numbers in our prepared comments. Overall it's been trending reasonably consistently in terms of the deals that we've been signing. We've obviously been converting those to construction and delivery at a higher rate of productivity. The make-up of it has shifted a bit, the U.S. not surprisingly has been a little bit slower and the rest of the world has been a little bit faster. But the net result has been the same and that's sort of the beauty of a big global business that is diversified the way we are and we like to think that we're pretty quick on our feet and that we're good at anticipating sort of the mega trends in terms of what's going on with demand growth, what's going on with flows of capital, so that we pivot in the right ways and the right time. So I'm pretty confident we will be able to continue to do that, which is why we're saying we think we'll have another record year in signings. I actually - well last year maybe was a little bit lighter in the U.S. and little bit heavier in the rest of the world. I think particularly given some momentum we have lived through and now with the addition of Moxy - Motto, that the U.S. will probably be flat a bit up this year but the net result would be I think for the next year to sort of we're comfortable that we can assign a similar amount to what we've been doing over the last few years.
Bill Crow: I take it you're not merging with Marriott to get the Moxy brand?
Chris Nassetta: No.
Bill Crow: Kevin, one from me for you, I would have thought maybe that share repurchases in the fourth quarter would have been a little bit more robust given the stock market sell-off. Were there black out period issues or what was your hesitation I guess at that point?
Kevin Jacobs: Bill, that's good question. There wasn't really hesitation. We ended up coming in at the top end of the range and so we did - we think we were down to a range of 1.8 to 1.9 at the - as of last earnings and we ended up at 1.9. So we kept it going and then yes, the very end of the year and leading into the beginning of this year you are on a 10b5-1 plan because your blackout period will remain, but we remain buying of course but you're on a plan where you don't get to control it. So nothing more complicated than that.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: I wanted to ask you on the reduction in third-party commission group rates that you put in place I think some time ago but we've heard that maybe you've put in some additional flexibility on the part of the owners or bookings and maybe you could just provide an update on that front?
Chris Nassetta: No. I mean we're not going to get any details on individual deal that we cut. We cut our commissions broadly across the Board from 10 to 7 with third-party group intermediaries which I assume what you're talking about. As we have always had that we have certain of our most important relationships where we have incentives systems built in. By the way that was the case back when we were at 10, that's the case the one we're at 7. So those continue on to make sure that we're driving share in the right way and incenting behavior to get disproportionate share. I have certain players where we think it's really incremental business that our sales team maybe has less access to. So I would say that that sort of business as usual as we've done it. I'm obviously not going to get into individual deals here whatever.
Smedes Rose: But you're not rolling back that initial…?
Chris Nassetta: No. Let me make perfectly clear, we are not rolling that back. We are 100% committed to the change we made.
Smedes Rose: I just wanted to ask you, so I mean it looks like the U.S., there's increasing evidence of the U.S. development cycle, it potentially peaks and starts to edge down. We talked about this before but it's always interesting to hear your thoughts on anything you're hearing from developers on terms of lending or access to capital or just lowered return expectations as overall cost - the cost environment continues to move up?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, there's nothing really new on that front. I mean I think that over the course of the past year or frankly in the financing cycle over the course of the past year so you've seen lenders on the margin get a little bit capital, get a little bit tighter and a little bit more expensive. Now that said you know for us the good news for us is we've got, we fight way above our weight in terms of the number of deals that we do. Good deals can - still plenty of capital in the world, good deals can still get financed and so we continue to fight above our fair share so that that hasn't been an issue. And of course construction costs have been going up particularly in the developed world a double-digit rates for a couple of years now and so you've seen broadly an overall slowdown in construction starts in the U.S. which is why you see the prognosticators predicting that supply growth is going to peak but for us we continue to you for high quality projects it's still - they're still readily financeable.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for joining us today. Good discussion. We'll look forward to talking after the first quarter. Obviously early in the year we'll have a lot more visibility on what's going on out there when we talk next. I appreciate the time today, and we'll catch up soon. Take care.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hilton Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, ma'am.
Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton's third quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our third quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jill. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter, driven by our resilient business model. Adjusted EBITDA was at the high-end of our guidance range and EPS exceeded expectations. We continue to increase our industry-leading market share premiums and to deliver strong net unit growth, all leading to increasing free cash flow. This setup coupled with a disciplined capital allocation strategy enables us to continue delivering long-term value for shareholders. Year-to-date, we have returned more than 8% of our market cap to shareholders or approximately $1.7 billion in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Turning to third quarter results, system-wide RevPAR grew 2%, driven entirely by rate gains. Broader industry fundamentals remain favorable with solid corporate transient RevPAR up 3% and continued strength in group business. Leisure transient was softer than forecasted, given weather-related disruptions and a meaningful impact from calendar shifts. Accounting for holidays and weather event impacts, we estimate second and third quarter RevPAR trends were essentially steady. For the fourth quarter, we expect fundamentals to remain favorable but comparability issues due to weather impacts to continue to affect RevPAR results. Our updated full-year RevPAR guidance range is 3% to 3.5%. Looking ahead to 2019, positive macro indicators suggest continued strength in lodging demand. This, together with decelerating supply growth in the U.S., should lead to fundamentals remaining positive, with regional GDP growth forecast indicating continued strength in international markets. Additionally, areas of the business, where we have better visibility, further support healthy dynamics going forward. Group position for next year remains up in the mid-to-high single digits, with nearly 70% of group business on the books. And early corporate rate negotiations show healthy year-over-year increases. As a result, we feel good about things heading into 2019 and expect RevPAR trends similar to this year, with growth of 2% to 4%. Our optimism also extends to our development outlook, where we continue to gain share of global activity. We ended the third quarter with more than 2,400 hotels, totaling roughly 371,000 rooms in our pipeline, up 11% year-over-year, driven by increases across both our U.S. and international pipelines. We remain on track to sign a record 110,000 rooms this year and deliver net unit growth of approximately 6.5% in 2018 and again in 2019. Highlighting our commitment to disciplined capital-light expansion across segments and geographies, we announced several notable transactions in the quarter. We expect to nearly double our all-inclusive portfolio over the next several years through our strategic alliance with Playa Hotels & Resorts, including adding two additional all-inclusive resorts by year-end. We also announced the signing of the Waldorf Astoria in Miami, which will feature private residences, retail and top restaurants. With Waldorf Astoria now having 30 properties globally, with recently added hotels in Las Vegas and Bangkok, we continue to gain traction among guests and owners alike. Additionally, we converted three properties in Dubai to luxury and full-service brands across our portfolio. This conversion significantly increases our presence in a unique and growing market, while further strengthening our partnership with the Al Habtoor Group. We continuously look for opportunities to broaden our demographic appeal and increase stay occasion among existing guests. With that in mind, yesterday, we launched our newest brand Motto by Hilton. Motto is an affordable brand that combines the best elements of micro hotels and urban lifestyle products. Properties will feature efficiently designed, adaptable rooms, innovative guest solutions and unique F&B offerings, local to each hotel's respective neighborhood. Deals in various stages of development span prime global locations, including New York City, London, Washington, D.C. and Tokyo. At full scale, we estimate Motto could total several hundred hotels across all major geographies. Our culture of innovation extends across brands and business areas, resulting in more loyalty members and growing market share premiums. In the third quarter, we added 3.7 million new Hilton Honors members, up more than 16% year-over-year. Our roughly 82 million Honors members now account for nearly 60% of system-wide occupancy. System-wide RevPAR index premiums rose approximately 100 basis points in the quarter, with all major regions and brand segments contributing to growth. Our web-direct platforms remain our fastest-growing booking channels, a trend we expect to further accelerate with the rollout of Expect Better. Expect Hilton, our largest portfolio of marketing campaign to-date, launched at the end of the third quarter. I'm very pleased we continue to be recognized for our ongoing commitment to our guests, team members, owners and communities. Most recently, Great Place to Work named Hilton number 2 on their list of the World's Best Workplaces. This is the third consecutive year we've been included on this prestigious list of global companies. Additionally, for the second year in a row, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. We're thrilled to be recognized as an industry leader for our Travel with Purpose commitments. Overall, the macro environment continues to drive favorable fundamentals. And as we look ahead into the balance of this year and into next year, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive strong top line and bottom line growth and to expand our global presence. As a result, we expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow to drive shareholder returns. Thank you. And now, with that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin to give a bit more detail on our results and the outlook going forward.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 2% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis. International RevPAR growth modestly exceeded expectations and continued to outpace U.S. growth. As Chris mentioned, weather and greater-than-expected disruption from calendar shifts led to modestly lower top line growth than we anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA of $557 million was near the high-end of our guidance range, increasing 9% year-over-year. Our performance was largely driven by better-than-expected license fees and greater cost discipline. In the quarter, management and franchise fees increased 10% to $544 million, at the high-end of our expected 8% to 10% range. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.77, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Turning to our regional performance and outlook, third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 1%. Corporate transient and group business remained solid. Performance was somewhat tempered by softer leisure transient occupancy, given weather and calendar-related disruption. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth of between 2% and 2.5%, given good fundamentals, partially offset by continued difficult comps from the storms last year. In the Americas outside of the U.S., third quarter RevPAR grew 5% versus the prior year, given a mix of strong leisure and corporate transient trends across Canada and broader market strength across the Caribbean. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region in the mid-single digit range. RevPAR in Europe grew 6.9% in the quarter, roughly 250 basis points ahead of our expectations. Strength in Turkey, coupled with increased demand in Russia related to the World Cup, largely drove our results. For the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single digit range, with strong trends across Continental Europe and an improved outlook for the UK and Ireland In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR grew 1.3% in the quarter, led by increased group volume and strong ADR across resort properties in Egypt. Performance was modestly offset by softer leisure business in the UAE and Dubai, given supply and demand imbalances. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to grow in the low single-digit range. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 5% in the quarter as typhoons and weather conditions slowed leisure growth. Trends in China remained robust with RevPAR up 8%, driven by strong industry dynamics and market share gains. For full year 2018, we continue to expect RevPAR growth for the Asia Pacific region in the high single-digit range, with RevPAR growth in China of around 11%, which accounts for weather-related impacts. Moving to guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of between 3% and 3.5% and adjusted EBITDA of $2.075 billion to $2.095 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. Guidance is in line with prior expectations, factoring for the third quarter beat, with some offset primarily from FX. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $2.67 to $2.72. For the fourth quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of between 2% and 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $518 million to $538 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.66 to $0.71. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the third quarter, bringing year-to-date dividends to $137 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect to return between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our third quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We'd like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up that is related to your original question. Denise, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Absolutely, Mr. Jacobs. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Chris, not so surprisingly, my first question or my question relates to your 2019 RevPAR growth commentary. I know it's early, but can you talk about how much of that is incorporated from some of ground up, either property level or regional inputs? And just broadly, can you talk about how you're seeing next year in terms of U.S., non-U.S. and then between corporate transient group and leisure? And then I have a quick follow-up for Kevin after that question.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Wow, this could take the rest of the call. I'm happy to do that. So, as you would imagine, this time of year, every year, we go through a process of looking, going top-down and bottom-up. I think, we start our budget process by sort of having a view of what's going on around the world broadly from a macro trend point of view, but also from a micro point of view in the various regions. We have lots of discussions with our teams in the regions and leadership and commercial teams. And then we go about a very granular bottoms-up budget process. While we're not complete with that process, I would say we are 90% complete with that process, which does give us a very much a hotel-by-hotel and region-by-region look at what we think we're going to produce next year. And so what we would typically do is aggregate that up and then give you, given that we're in October of 2018 and we're looking forward to 2019, give a fairly broad range that's the point up and point down around a midpoint, in this case of 3%, just based on the fact that it's early, as you pointed out. Important to note, so the range in outcome that we're giving, focusing on the midpoint, is very much the result of that process and very much the result of a buildup of a property-by-property and region-by-region analysis that takes a lot of time and effort by our teams. I think when you think about it, it is informed, from a macro point of view, by a few things. One, the current expectations are both for the U.S. and global GDP growth, that they will be relatively consistent with this year. When you look at non-residential fixed investment numbers broadly, particularly in the U.S., they have been very strong this year and reasonably strong last year, forecasted to be strong, again, next year. That has the highest correlation to demand in hotel rooms historically. In the U.S., looking at supply numbers, we think the supply numbers are going to tick down against that backdrop next year. Obviously, in the same way that we are experiencing difficult comps in the second half of this year related to both holidays and weather impacts, those comps, then, for the second half of next year, will become much easier, which will be helpful. And then getting to the segments, our view, and I said it in my comments, is that we're seeing very healthy growth across all the major segments. If you sort of neutralize for all the weather and holiday impacts and then what's happening right now, which, we think, best we can see, is going to continue into next year, you saw post tax reform, business transient pick up from anemic growth of like 0% to 1% to sort of in the 2% to 3% range. You've seen leisure transient remain relatively steady and strong, sort of in the 3%, 3-plus percent range. And then you've seen group ticking up into the 3% to 4% range. That's what you've been seeing this year. Again, when we neutralize for all the things that are going on with weather and everything else, we don't think that that changed in the third quarter. We don't think that's changing in the fourth quarter. We think those trends are broadly going to remain consistent and, I think, are supported by where we do have visibility, and I talked about it a little bit, are supported by the fact that we have a very strong group position, pace has been great, position going into next year is, frankly, as strong as I've seen it, and that supports it. When we think about our special corporate negotiations and the dialogue with our big corporate accounts around both volume and our ability to drive some incremental rate, those conversations have been quite positive and stronger than where we were at this time last year. So, when we put all of that together, again, those macro conditions that I just walked through and then we look at it property-by-property and aggregate it up, that's where we come out. And I've said this, I think, a bunch of times on the last call and otherwise publicly, next year, at the moment, it feels to us a lot like this year feels but both from the standpoint of our NUG growth but also our same store growth. And I do realize there is a negative sentiment out there. I read the papers, I watch the news, and so I appreciate that. The reality is, when we look at the business and what it's producing today and we look at the forward trends that we have, it does not reflect. What it reflects is, what we've suggested is that next year, it looks like, all things being equal, we should be delivering results very similar to this year. And so that's what we're trying – we're trying to give you the best perspective we have in looking at the business in as scientific a way as we can. In terms of, I think, the only question, Joe, I didn't get there was U.S. versus international. I think it's again common theme. I think next year is going to look a lot like this year. I believe the international will lead the U.S., it will be stronger than U.S. My guess is, particularly with the strong group base and tick down in supply, the U.S. will, probably – in our numbers, in our rollup will be modestly better, not materially, modestly better; and the international will be modestly lower. And they'll be modestly lower because, hard to replicate the year we're having in APAC and for that matter in Europe, so our expectation is, while it will outpace U.S. growth, it won't outpace it at quite the same rate, so a little bit more U.S., a little bit less international but I would say, I think, when the year is out next year, it looks a lot like this year and it's not going to be materially off of that. Did I miss any of your points?
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: No, you've hit them all, Chris, thank you. And then, Kevin, just quickly, you referenced FX as an offset or as the drag a couple of times in your prepared comments. What was the FX EBITDA impact in the 3Q? And what's incorporated in the 4Q relative to a quarter ago?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. In the fourth quarter, so in the third quarter, it was sort of mid-single-digit millions. In the fourth quarter, it's about the same. So, if you take, we beat by $7 million, it's the majority of that $7 million coming down – bringing the full year down to the midpoint is FX.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you so much.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hey, good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Just wanted to drill down a little bit more maybe into regional question. First of all, if we were to see any evidence of global economic slowing, probably be in Asia, what are you seeing there as far as pacing in price for the next, say, 6 to 12 months.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: We haven't seen, Harry, a whole lot of difference. You can look at our third quarter numbers, then I think rightfully say, well, it looks like it's cooled off a little bit. But I think they're – not to make excuses, I think, scientifically, they're just – there were things going on in Asia that drove that. You had a bunch of typhoons that affect – some affected in China, a meaningful effect in Japan, other sort of one-time events that affected Southeast Asia. So, those are the things, when we look at what happened in the third quarter, were driving it. The basic underlying trends, like much of the world, we think are relatively stable. Having said that, it does appear that China's economy is slowing down, sort of, as I said, we read the papers, I was just in China, we're around the world a lot. And so, when I said our expectation is maybe a tick higher in the U.S., a bit lower driven by Asia and Europe, maybe not being able to keep up quite the pace of growth, some of that – we have certainly built some of that into our thinking. In other words, we would expect China to finish this year sort of in the 11% range as an example. We are assuming something lower than that next year honestly. I think, it's 8% or 9% from a budgeting point of view, just to put it in context to be reflective of the fact that even though we haven't seen any meaningful trend other than sort of the impact I told you in third quarter, we haven't seen an underlying weakness. The reality is that the economy is going to slow in China, there should be some knock-on effects. So we've tried to reflect that in the numbers for Asia Pacific, largely driven by what I talked about in China. And same in Europe, Europe is having a really good year. And the expectation is it's just – to a degree, we're early but we have a great group position et cetera, but group is not nearly as much of the business over there. I think just to be a bit conservative, if you will, we've assumed that we won't have quite the growth rate. So, we've tried to reflect that in, but in terms of like have we seen real signs of like sort of global slowdown in the core parts of the business, we have not seen that. We are trying to be thoughtful and reasonably conservative about looking into next year to incorporate some of those views, but we have not real-time seen it.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Very good. And let's come back to the U.S. My question is as you've been having conversations with meeting planners and heads of corporate travel, what are they telling you about next year's demand needs? And is there any evidence of pushback? What I'm trying to get a sense of is you've been dealing with them for a long time, how reliable – how often are they right, is it a reliable forward indicator?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think that they're right until they're wrong. I know that's not the answer you want. I mean, here is the thing. When we're talking to our – the meeting planners and on the group side, you heard we have a lot of optimism because the numbers suggest we should. I said on the corporate side, special corporates, by the way that's only 10% of the business, so keep it in perspective. But it's a good sideline into the psychology of some of the biggest companies we deal with. All those are positive. I mean, not everybody is created equal but broadly people say they're going to travel more for business and for meetings and they know they're going to pay more and they're willing to pay more. And they're willing to pay more at an increasing rate as compared to what they would have said a year ago. So, again, I don't want to be Pollyanna, but I think all of that's positive and I think all of those judgments are based on the fact that people think that the global economy, the U.S. economy in the case of U.S.-centric companies are just going to hang in there and keep chugging along, which is, obviously, what is built into the assumptions of our guidance. But the conversations have been quite positive, I mean, not racing to the stars but incrementally more positive than when I was sitting here a year ago. It would be hard to say it in any other way.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Very good. Thanks Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Carlo.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You guys talked a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the demand side in China, et cetera, but on the pipeline side, has anything changed with respect to the cadence of your discussions and/or the kind of ongoing development that would give you guys any pause?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Not really. I mean, I think, why I talked about one of the supporting factors in the macro side on the fundamentals was supply is going down in the U.S., okay? So it stands to reason that it's getting – if that's happening, it's getting harder for everybody to get deals done in the U.S. Thankfully we fight it twice, we're 11-and-change of the market in the U.S. and we have 25% of the rooms under construction or something like that. So when we fight way over our weight, but I would say the trend line continues in the sense that it's getting – we're getting more than our fair share, but it's getting harder to get deals done. So, even though we will hit a record in signings in the world this year, another one off the record of last year, signings in the U.S. will go down a little bit, starts will go down a little bit, NUG will go down a little bit because it's getting harder to get deals done. So it's not getting – I mean, incrementally it's not getting – since the last quarter I don't think it's dramatically or materially different, but it's definitely harder, why? Inflation is picking up, cost of labor is going up, cost to build projects is going up. We think by the end of the year, it'll be sort of a 10% increase in the cost to build. While you're not seeing incredible turn of the wheel and tightening of credit, it's just a little bit tighter, a little bit harder to get things done. Interest rates are a little – are moving a little bit in the wrong direction. So, all of that adds up to – it makes it harder in the U.S. and that's why you see supply going down. And I think you'll keep seeing supply go down because it takes a long time for that cycle to reverse. I would be remiss in not making the following statement. The great news is the reason we're signing record deals and we're going to have a record delivery of NUG this year and it's going to go up, again, next year is because the world is a big place. And we've anticipated the ebbs and flows and allocated our resources appropriately around the world. And so while one market is slowing, in this case the U.S., other markets are picking up. So Asia Pacific continues to pick up. Frankly, all of our international markets continue to pick up. And we continue to get better and better at what we do at sort of building relationships and deploying our brands in intelligent ways to keep our growth going, so that's how we can add more net rooms next year and hit another record than we did this year, notwithstanding the fact that the U.S. market is slowing. And I think we'll continue to be in a slowing pattern until you have – until the whole sort of system resets itself.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then, if I could, Chris, you've always been kind of very firm in your views on M&A and your ability to kind of develop and grow from within. In the current environment, has anything changed in your perception of where and when possible, you would consider acquisitions?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, no, the short answer is no. The filters have always been – for the 11 years I've been here, the filters have literally remained the same. Does something really work well strategically in terms of brands and our brand portfolio versus what we can do on our own and does it – can we do it in a way that's really accretive to value? And as we filtered and I say it all the time, we look at almost everything, everything to-date that we have filtered through that, those lenses, really has not made sense versus what we're doing like launching Motto by Hilton just yesterday, where we think we can do it better than anything out there and we can do it exactly the way the customer wants it and create more organic growth without having to buy growth. So, we keep making that decision because I think it's been the right decision. I always end this M&A discussion with never say never. I'm not saying that something wouldn't pass through that filtration system. It hasn't to-date and our philosophy remains exactly what it has been.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you sir.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. Just, I guess, a couple of quick follow-ups to Carlo's questions. I guess, first, are you seeing any changes in the competitive dynamic as it relates to getting deals done, whether that's terms and/or the need for key money to incite deals? And would you anticipate that to change if the environment remains tight? And then second, given the current weakness in the stock and market more broadly, I guess, how is your approach to capital allocation evolving? And can you just remind us of your leverage thresholds? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'll take the first and give Kevin the second. The competitive environment, I'd say, did not change in any material way. I mean, in the U.S. when there is less getting done, deals get a little bit harder to do. Reality is, as I said, we fight way over our weight because we have the highest market share brands and the highest average market share. That doesn't mean we don't compete. On occasion – sometimes we don't but on occasion we do. So, I would say in a minor way, I'd say the deal terms in the U.S. have gotten incrementally tougher but not in any material way. Around the rest of the world, really no change, things sort of click along as usual, so I'd say not much to talk about there. Kevin, on capital allocation.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And then, Stephen, on capital allocation, nothing has really changed. I mean our stated leverage range is 3x to 3.5x. You saw us get kind of the top-ish, maybe a little bit higher on a trailing basis to that range when we did the HNA transaction earlier this year. So, we're still thinking about the same things the same way. We'll continue to distribute the lion's share of our free cash flow. You noticed from our prepared remarks that we're keeping the dividend the same, which means that as the EBITDA of the company grows, the amount available for share buybacks will increase accordingly, but nothing has really changed yet strategically.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, we like the stock at $88. Obviously, we'll like it even better at this price.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great, thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning, guys. Just wanted to ask, I think, in the press release this morning, you guys actually put in a comment on the unit growth side around conversion activity and how important that is or maybe becoming. So, could you just give us a little bit more color there? So, first off, is conversion activity accelerating at this point in the cycle? And then what are you seeing or hearing from your development organization on that front and how much of that is sort of factored into your net unit growth outlook for 2019?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, good question. I expect that conversion activity will accelerate more. I would say what we've seen technically so far is a minor acceleration, not much of a uptick. I think when we finish the year, we'll probably do in 2018 about 20% of our NUG will be conversions. I think, ultimately depending on what goes on, this is sort of countercyclical, when things gets tough, conversion activity picks up. We've seen a little bit of an uptick this year. We're not expecting, given our outlook for next year, to see a whole heck of a lot of uptick because we think next year is going to be another pretty good year. Eventually when a business cycle turns, I think you would see those numbers go up. But what's built into our expectations for our 6% to 7% is a comparable percentage of conversions, which is about 20%. We have almost never delivered less than that and we have more tools and more weapons in the arsenal in the sense that in the old days, we had really one conversion brand in DoubleTree. Now we have Tapestry, Curio, soon soft luxury brand that is coming in addition to DoubleTree and other brands, but those will be the brands where you find the bulk of it. So, we will eventually see the numbers tick up, I don't think real soon built into next year as a comparable level to this year. So, a lot of next year, when you boil it down with that gap having to, obviously, be filled, a lot of next year is in the bank in the sense that the 80% of it is under construction. I mean, it may move a month or two here or there, but it's in process.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Can you just give us a sense, Chris, like at a high level, where that number was or the conversion activity was kind of two to three years ago, just as a guidepost for that 20% number? Was it lower two or three years ago kind of and directionally, how much?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, we've been running like 19% to 25%. I mean, coming out of the Great Recession on a much smaller base and the Great Recession, obviously, was a very big countercyclical opportunity, where there was a lot of fear in the markets. I mean we maxed out in the high 30s. I think, I wouldn't expect that we would get to that level again but we've been sort of running around this level. So, I don't feel like this is certainly – it doesn't feel like it's a big pull to us. My development team, of course, knows they've got to do a lot of work, so if they're listening, I don't want them to think otherwise. But this is something we have typically been able to deliver with a fair amount of ease.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I wanted to see if you could put a little finer point on corporate rate negotiations. I know it's only 10% of the business, but the owners are saying it's critical for ADR growth for next year. At one point, you said you're seeing healthy rate increases, but then you kind of broke it down and you said something about occupancy or the demand side. Then you said you hope to see some incremental rate increases. So I'm just curious. Are we looking at kind of 0% to 1% on the rates, are we looking at 2% to 3%? What are you...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think we're looking at – last year we were looking at like 1-ish, you could argue 1% to 2%, but I think it really ended up in the low 1s. We thought 1% to 2%. It ended up closer to 1% than 2%. Right now, it looks like 2% to 3%. I mean, I talked to the teams yesterday to get the latest and greatest update. And it feels to them like 2% to 3%. Now, again, it's 10% of the business, but obviously a good indicator.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe for Kevin, on the capital return, obviously, you had the opportunity this year to buy back maybe more than you would have, but given, Chris, your commentary on the sameness of next year versus this year in different metrics, should we assume $1.5 billion to $2 billion of capital return?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think, Bill, the way to think about it is next – we did bring forward some leverage into this year around the HNA opportunity. So, the trade-off, obviously, is free cash flow. We've got to be careful we're not giving bottom line guidance, but free cash flow, if you just take what we're saying about RevPAR, net unit growth ought to be a little bit higher next year than this year. And then you will have the opportunity as EBITDA grows to re-leverage a little bit, but we brought leverage forward this year around the HNA deal. So, if we were to hit the midpoint of our leverage guidance for next year, it's logical to assume that the amount would be somewhat lower next year than it was this year.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay, that's it from me. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Could you provide us some more detail on your group position being up mid to high single digits, what markets are driving that, and is it more volume or rate?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: So it's broad-based. There's not like one industry group driving it or, frankly, one region, although the bulk of our group business ultimately is in the U.S. It is broad-based. It's up, I would say, in the close to 8% range. Now, we, being perfectly objective and as scientific as we can be, we believe some of that has to do with commission policies. We do believe that as we look into next year. Now, the business is going to show up, so it's going to be good for the business but we do believe, as a result of the change in the commission policies, that we advance some amount of bookings and we think that probably means that the real position is 8% to 9%, we think, when you sort of back out the commission effect, it's still very easily 5% to 6% up, which we feel good about. And it's basically split pretty evenly between – I was just looking at this yesterday as well, it's basically split pretty equally between volume and rate.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it, thanks. And on the other end of the scale, some of the limited service brands underperformed in the quarter and this year. Is that just due to higher supply growth or is that a bit of a demand component that is impacting relative RevPAR growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think that's what you're seeing kind of broadly across the industry and I think it's a combination of things. Yes, more of the supply growth. Even the supply growth is low and it's going down, you certainly have seen more of the supply growth in those segments, which, I think, is probably the largest contributor. We have some other specific things going on if you look at it. But, I mean, in terms of renovation work going on like in the Hampton brand, I think, 25% of the brand is under renovation at the moment and that has some impact. But even with that, the Hampton brand has grown market share. So, it is still outperforming the market. I think broadly in terms of why is that segment in the market is underperforming is to do with the incremental supply in that area, which will be diminishing.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Great, thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks. One, shorter-term question and one longer-term question. You were talking about some of the factors that led Q3 to come in a little bit lower in the U.S. than you had thought. When we look at just the weekly data so far, first half of October is also not off to a great start, so just wondering if you see sort of a clear – what you see in your sort of next 30 days in the U.S. looking different maybe than kind of – it looks like some of the same trends have continued in early October, so I hate to be so short term about it but I know that there's concern out there about kind of what happened in the short-term versus previous guidance and all of that. And then my other question is on group, I think, you said 3% to 4% is what the increase was in 2018. I don't know if you put numbers around and you said 70% of next year's group is on the books but where you're seeing rate and volume for group business for 2019 so far? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Robin. I think for the last few weeks, you're still seeing kind of residual – you're seeing continuation of the tougher comps from last year, where the storms and the other weather-related events, particularly in the United States, just generated a lot of business last year that we're still comping over. So, our outlook for the year incorporates a little bit better fourth quarter than third quarter. So, I think you're still seeing some of that show up in the weeklys. And then on the group side, I think, it's about the same, the picture is about the same, it's about half and half between – split pretty evenly between volume and rate in that 3% to 4%.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Yeah, but I was asking about your 2019 group, what you have on the books and rate and volume, what level of increases or not increases for 2019 versus what you saw a year ago for 2018?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's about the same, yeah, it's about the same.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: So, in other words, were the 3% to 4% where group is ending up for 2018, is exactly what you thought it would be a year ago?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's pretty comparable, yeah.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's pretty comparable. I think about a year ago, we were saying mid-single digits and it's coming in sort of 3% to 4%, pretty close as we expected, yeah, sorry I didn't understand the question, Robin.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Right, in other words, just thinking about where group came in versus your expectations for 2018 and then how that means for 2019?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: They came in consistent with our expectations.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Great. Good morning. Thank you. My first question relates to your management business. What are you seeing or forecasting for labor costs growing at next year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think next year, Patrick, probably about the same as this year on the labor side. Probably 3% to 4% all-in wages and benefits, which is, I think, about the same as this year.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay, Thank you. And secondly on the group number that you gave for 8% to 9% next year, and correct me if I'm wrong, that's not a same-store number. Do you have a same store number that you can give?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: So, that is the system-wide same-store. What I was trying to do is make sure that we're being honest about trying to filter out the impact of anything we thought that was a result of bookings being advanced because of our change in commission policy. Now admittedly, Pat, that's – I mean, we're trying to apply science to it, it isn't going to be perfect science, we look at what we're doing through intermediaries versus what we're doing in direct bookings to sort of arrive at an equation that tell us where we think we'd be. Mid-single digits, 5% or 6% is where we think we feel confident without any changes in commission policy we would've been, which is not too terribly – as Kevin point out, not too terribly different than where we were at this time last year. That's why we think delivering 3% to 4% next year when we finish the year in group growth is reasonable.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Makes sense.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you. That's it
Operator: The next question will be from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC: Hey, good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC: To quickly follow up on Pat's question there, just in the context of ongoing union negotiations around the country, I think it's been a little more impactful recently to Marriott then you guys but within that 3% to 4% labor cost assumption for next year, how much variability would you say is included within that range, again, given the ongoing nature of those sorts of discussions?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I don't think a lot of variability. Obviously, we're not going to comment on negotiations going on with the unions, which are ongoing. We have a good relationship with the unions and they've been sorting through market by market deals. I think that we will end up in those ranges regardless of where those deals turn out. Remember also that in our case, it's a little less than a third of our workforce is in organized format, so two thirds of it is outside of that. When you blend it together, we had, in Kevin's number, he's – in that range, he's...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's the whole system, yeah.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: ...it's the whole system and he is factoring for that.
Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC: Okay, that's helpful. And then another quick follow-up to the capital return forecast whether speaking of this year, next year, just, in general, how much – how quickly can you pivot if need be given a short-term dislocation in stock prices as we may or may not be seeing kind of in the current environment, against those longer-term capital return forecasts and also the leverage limits that you guys referred to?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, I think, if we want to, we have a significant amount of flexibility and we can pivot quite quickly.
Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Any more specifics around that or just as a general comment?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No.
Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. That's all from me. Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: All right thanks.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi Research. Please go ahead, sir
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you about this new brand rollout, Motto, when you did Tru, I think you...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Motto, come on Smedes, get it right.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Motto, Motto, sorry.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: You have a Motto. It's not MotoPhoto.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: When you did Tru, Chris, I think that it was initially offered to owners of Hampton Inns and then, obviously, you went on to a very successful rollout. I'm wondering is there anything that you're doing to kind of jump start this brand with your current owners, maybe sort of any feedback on initial sign-ups that you're receiving from developers that you can share with us?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I'm happy, thank you for the question. I'm glad we got a question on our new brand. It seems like people ask about our new brands every call and now we launch one and nobody wants to talk about it but happy to talk about it. We're very excited about Motto by Hilton. And we are, of course, as we would do with all our brands and you're right to point out, look, that we went to our most important Hampton owners largely and gave them the opportunity on Tru. Doing a very similar – we have a very similar approach with Motto always because our existing owner base has been very loyal to us and we want to be loyal to them. So, not only are we going to them as the first shot out of the blocks to, say, hey, do you want to work with us on this, but there has been a cadre of them that have been very involved in the development of the brand. Let me put it in (50:18). We're always talking to customers and doing focus groups as we design these brands and figure out how to make them tick the right way, so that they'll appeal to customers but we are also working very closely with owners to make sure that we're engineering the cost to build and the cost to operate in a way that they'll deliver returns that work for owners. Otherwise, we'll have a great thing for a customer, but we will have no hotels for the customer to stay in. So it's very much sort of a dual process. And so we brought a great cadre of owners that we worked with around the world and to be part of that process. And they are very excited about it and so not surprisingly the first deal, many of the first deals we're doing are with existing owners, not all but many of those deals are. We have essentially, I think, we have six deals I mean these are more complicated than Tru's given that they are urban and by the very nature of what it is, it's a little bit longer gestation period and higher degree of complexity. We have about a half a dozen deals done. I would say, based just on the conversations I've been having including yesterday where we've had a huge group of owners in for the launch here at our Innovation Gallery, we probably have another 20 deals sort of cooking, and ultimately, Tru will be thousands of hotels, okay. Tru will be the biggest brand we have just because of the price point it's at. Motto will be very big, but as I said in my prepared remarks, it's hundreds of hotels. So I think we're off to a great start. It's a wonderful way for us to better serve our existing customer base. Even more importantly, it's a great customer acquisition, so it's great product that we can attract customers that have heretofore not been able to stay with us that want to be in an urban environment and adventurous and they need a product at a price point they can afford whether they are young, in middle-aged or old that this is where they want to be and this is a product now that we are putting out there that we think will make it much more affordable for them to stay with us. And when they stay with us we have a pretty good track record of getting them to try other things with us. So we're very excited about it. Again, these are more complicated urban deals they take longer to sort of pull together. But I think you'll see that we'll very quickly get the pipeline into the dozens of hotels and I think we'll start bringing it to life and reality. Hopefully, next year you will be able to take on a tour of the first Motto.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. And then I just wanted to ask you mentioned you guys hit about 80 million Honors members at this point. Can you – have you seen any change in the percent of bookings going to direct versus OTAs or is that ratio still pretty constant.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, the ratio is good what we saw in the third quarter it generally tracks year-to-date, but third quarter number is, we were growing our direct channel share and the OTAs were flat. So that – and that's before we essentially started the latest big push on our campaign of direct book that started rolling at the end of the quarter. So the trends are what we want to see, which again is not that we're not going to or don't want to work with the OTAs, we do, we just want to work with them in the right times, in the right ways at the right price. And we want to more and more to have a direct relationship as much as we can and that's what we're seeing happen in our channel mix, more growth in direct, our direct channels particularly our web direct channels, and third quarter flat on OTAs.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me, just on the ownership assets, they performed pretty well in the third quarter from a RevPAR standpoint and year to date, I believe most of these are flagship Hiltons in Europe. Is this strong performance really just kind of a product of, Chris, what you were talking about a strong group traveler in Europe or is there anything else? And if your outlook, as you mentioned, for Europe is positive in 4Q and going forward, is there any reason why these assets should kind of come down below the M&F RevPAR? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Chad, I'll take this one, I mean, interesting that there are a bunch of flagship Hiltons in Europe that are part of that portfolio, there also are bunch of hotels in Asia that are part of the portfolio. And even though Japan has a little bit of disruption from a typhoon, the RevPAR growth was still quite strong in Japan and a couple of other places in Asia. So you're seeing some of that sort of filter through that portfolio, but Central Europe, of course, was quite strong in the quarter, which helped. And the trends ought to be really consistent in the fourth quarter. It's a very similar outlook.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay, thanks. That's all from me.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from David Beckel of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hey, thanks for the question. I think it's been a little bit of time since you've updated us on the Hampton Inn rollout in China. Can you just give us an update on signings and openings for the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Our Plateno deal is going really, really well. I think, at this point, Jill and Kevin can fact-check me, I think we've done 250 deals-ish. I think we have opened 50. I think we expect to open like 20 more by the end of the year. I think we're hoping that we have about 70 opened and I think we expect to open 100 next year. So it's moving at a great pace. It's having the impact that we want, which is building our network effect in China in secondary and tertiary cities with what is a great product, with a great partner. Importantly, because if we don't deliver results, people, as I say, stop building us hotels. The performance of the hotels is really, really strong in terms of the returns that our partners are getting on these deals. So we feel very good about it and think it's going to keep cranking. If you think about what's going on in China, I've said this many times, not dissimilar from other parts of the world, the mid-market is where you're going to see the bulk of the growth, just because the phenomenon of middle class growth at a very high rate, middle class can afford mid-market type brands. And that's why we were so interested to get in with Hampton with a partner to try and build that network as fast as we could and it's working.
David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And just a quick follow up, given some of the M&A that Jin Jiang has been involved with, has that affected your relationship with them or the development agreement in any way?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, it hasn't. We maintain a great relationship. We are in constant dialogue with them about a whole bunch of different things, including the Hampton relationship. I think it's the one that they are very positive about and, if anything, interested in speeding it up, as are we, not in any way changing it or slowing it down.
David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thanks so much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from David Katz of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
David Katz - Jefferies LLC: Hi. Good morning, all.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Morning.
David Katz - Jefferies LLC: Congrats. It all seems quite clear that we're two minutes away from the hour, but I wanted to just touch on one topic, which is your high-end strategy. The portfolio of brands is obviously very complete or nearly complete from top to bottom. How are you thinking about the highest end? I know you're adding Waldorfs and Conrads, et cetera in different places, but just go back to the make or buy discussion as it relates to that end of the business and the degree to which you can bolster through soft branding, let's say, but I'd love a little color just about that specific asset.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's a good and important question in the sense that we, if I think about how I allocate my time relative to the size of the business, I allocate disproportionate amount of time to luxury for a couple of reasons. One, it's hard. The deals are complicated and difficult, not many of them get done around the world. And it's important. It's important because, even though in the end I don't think luxury is going to be a whopping component of our bottom line EBITDA and free cash flow, it's important as a halo effect for our loyalty system and for our most loyal customer who want to be able to travel the road and be the road warrior and ultimately aspire to hit the Conrad in the Maldives or the Waldorf in the Maldives or the Waldorf in Bangkok, resorts and luxury hotels. Whether they use it or not, they want to dream about using it and so it is important and we spend a lot of time on it. We started standing still 11 years ago. We pretty much had nothing really going on in luxury, a handful of assets you would call luxury. If you fast forward to today, we've worked very diligently with great discipline over time grinding it out organically. And today, with Conrad and Waldorf alone, and I'll talk about other things we're going to do, we have over 100 hotels open or in the pipeline. And that's with having taken some properties out that really don't fit the bill. There is probably a few more of those that over time have to happen, but the net of that will be more adding. The net unit growth in luxury will be positive because we have so many good things going on. And if you think of about where we've been adding them in Beverly Hills, in Shanghai, in Beijing, in Amsterdam, our deal in London, just announced deal in Miami, another important one coming in the United States and I could go on and on. I think we're making a tremendous amount of progress. We've got 64 open. We've got 38 in the pipeline for both brands. And these are really word class luxury assets that are resonating unbelievably well with our customers. That's why we're having such great growth – part of the reason we are having great growth in Honors, more Honors occupancy. All of this is connected together. We have a couple other pistons that will start firing, one soon, the other probably in the next year or two. The one soon is soft luxury. Again, it's not going to be hundreds of hotels. I guess it could be over time. But it will certainly add to the luxury side of business. And then we will eventually do luxury lifestyle. We have chosen not to do it because of other opportunities. And we can only do so much at one time, but ultimately, we will have a luxury lifestyle brand as well. And those two incremental brands, I think, will take what is already a very good story with Waldorf and Conrad and growth and quality of the properties and size of the system and add to it. If you said to me like in a perfect word, you could just go out tomorrow and fix it, if I could have done that 11 years ago, it would have been a lot easier, but it's not. The practical reality is it's not really possible, because back to my comments on M&A, the things that you could make available don't really funnel through our filtration system. They either have their own problems as a brand or the economics of it would be such that you would destroy a lot of value and so, while we've looked at lots of things, honestly, none of them have made sense. And we are quite confident, I underline confident particularly today after 11 years of hard work and we have really good trajectory on luxury that we're going to a good place that we have enough scale and presence. It is not only not holding us back but look at the overall network effect we've created. We've got highest average market share across all of our brands of anybody in the industry. So here's the thing, it's working. We got to keep it working, which is what we get paid to do and we will but it's working. And so we will keep grinding it out. And five and 10, not even, over the next three or four years, you'll continue to see some really important hotels and advances in the upper end of the business for us.
David Katz - Jefferies LLC: Thank you. And if I can just follow-up on one other segment, obviously you think it's important enough to look at the all-inclusive segment as it is today based on what you've done, but is that a segment that you could envision broadening across different price levels over time? How big an opportunity do you think that particular segment is or is this just a good to have because it was available to you?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think it's a pretty important segment. I think it's big but it's not gargantuan in the sense that it's only really applicable at the moment in certain micro markets around the world. So I think it's important when we talked to our – the reason we did the deal with Playa because they're very good at it. And we've had a long relationship there and I've had a long relationship with Bruce. We did a lot of work with our customer base and they said this is something that we want. Again, it wasn't overwhelming like every customer – but there was enough of our customer base that said they wanted it and you can do it enough places with high quality product that we thought it was important to do. Whether you do it across a bunch of different price points, I think that's unclear, I mean, I think it's all resorts sort of in the upper upscale, could you go upscale. Possibly at the moment we are really focused more on the upper upscale. We do think there are a bunch of other markets that we are not in that we could do it and I do think it's a decent size opportunity but not, as I said, not a gargantuan opportunity. And we will look – currently, we are doing it with sort of as an extension of our core brand at the moment Hilton. We will look at whether as we get into it, if we think there is enough opportunity to sort of create effectively its own presence, create a independent or an extension of the Hilton with a real brand name to it as opposed to just being part of the Hilton system, but it's premature for us to judge that. We are very pleased with where we are. We think it makes, it adds to our growth, it adds to our profitability and it's one more weapon in our arsenal to please a certain segment of our customers who want to stay there and earn points. And importantly they want to redeem at certain types of resorts and the all-inclusive environment is an environment that enough of our customer says they want that we thought it was important that we were present.

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be able to report another strong quarter. RevPAR growth of 4% was at the high end of our guidance range, which drove bottom line growth ahead of our expectations. We continued to deliver across all major regions, segments, and areas of the business. Both U.S. and international markets contributed to great results. Leisure and corporate transient each grew roughly 3% in the quarter, and group RevPAR meaningfully outpaced expectations, increasing high single digits year-over-year in the quarter. Our performance continues to demonstrate the benefits of a simplified model as well as geographic and changed skill diversification. The result is a high quality fee stream that generates significant free cash flow and enables us to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $1.6 billion to shareholders, or roughly 6.5% of our market cap. This includes participation in both HNA and Blackstone's recent secondary offerings, during which both fully exited their positions in Hilton. For the full year, we now expect to return a total of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Turning to our outlook, group position remains up in the mid-single digits for the full year and into 2019, and booking pace in the quarter for all future periods was up in the low double digits. Positive macro trends continue to support favorable industry fundamentals with forecasts calling for economic growth in every major region of the world through 2019. In the U.S., economic indicators are modestly up versus prior expectations. Given synchronized global growth and particularly good trends in corporate spending, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% for the full year 2018, and bottom line results modestly ahead of prior expectations. Our ability to deliver growth ahead of the broader industry is the result of our disciplined development strategy. We're committed to putting the right brands in the right locations at the right time. Our disproportionate share of the global pipeline relative to our existing size continues to illustrate the success of this approach. In fact, signings for the full year are on track to hit our 110,000 rooms, surpassing our 2017 record levels and providing a solid base for continued long-term growth. This is up versus prior expectations, boosted in part by tremendous growth across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, where total signings are on pace to increase more than 40% year-over-year. Additionally, conversion signings are up more than 60% versus last year, meaning we'll be adding even more iconic properties to our portfolio, including the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas. Due to open in early September, this marks the brand's entry into another important and dynamic market. All of this is driving a record pipeline, which totaled over 360,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, representing 9% year-over-year growth and an industry-leading 41% of existing room base. Year-to-date, we've opened approximately 23,000 net rooms, up 8% versus the prior year, and remain on track to deliver roughly 6.5% net unit growth for the full year. We had several notable openings in the quarter, including the Hilton Santa Barbara Beachfront Resort and the Hilton Dalian Golden Pebble Beach Resort. With signature restaurants and each boasting nearly 20,000 square feet of meeting space, these stunning properties are fantastic additions to our resort portfolio. On the loyalty front, we added more than 3 million new Hilton Honors members in the quarter, bringing our total program to approximately 78 million members. With consistently strong growth, we are well-positioned to hit over 100 million member target by our 100-year anniversary next summer. Additionally, members are more active and engaged than ever before. Honors share of occupancy increased 120 basis points in the quarter to nearly 60%, and members have unlocked over 25 million doors to date using digital keys at more than 3,600 properties. To win on customer experience, we are incredibly focused on innovation. Technology, coupled with data and analytics, play an important role on our ability to truly personalize every step of the customer journey to drive more guest loyalty. From industry first launches, like Connected Room and our partnership with SHOWTIME to continuous Hilton Honors enhancements and offers, we're leveraging important tools to give our customers the choice and control they want from their travel experiences. We also look for ways to innovate across other areas of our business. In April, we announced new 2030 goals as part of our Travel with Purpose corporate responsibility strategy. Through this initiative, we committed to cut our environmental impact in half and double our investment in social impact. Our sustainability efforts have already saved $1 billion in operating efficiencies since 2008. Overall, we're very happy with our performance in the quarter and feel very good about the setup for the rest of the year. The macro environment continues to provide favorable industry dynamics and we continue to execute on an industry-leading development strategy while delivering unique guest experiences, all of which should continue to drive strong shareholder returns. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more details on our results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 4% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis, achieving the high end of our guidance range. Growth was driven by both occupancy and rate gains and benefited from the timing of Easter. As Chris mentioned, we saw solid performance across all major geographies and all business segments. Adjusted EBITDA of $555 million exceeded expectations, increasing 10% year-over-year. Outperformance was largely driven by better-than-expected fee growth. In the quarter, management and franchise fees increased 11% to $547 million ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range due to RevPAR gains, better-than-expected license fee growth, as well as some timing items that we expect to reverse later in the year. Diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.70, achieving the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our regional performance and outlook, second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 3.5%, led by strong group demand, particularly in company meetings and convention business, and better-than-expected results at our luxury resorts. Revenue from international inbound travel also helped results, growing over 8% in the quarter, due largely to increases from China, Europe, and Canada. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, given better-than-expected group business and corporate transient trends. In the Americas, outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR grew 6.5% versus the prior year, given a mix of strong convention and corporate transient demand trends across Canada and broader market strength across the Caribbean and South America. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region to grow in the mid-single-digit range. RevPAR in Europe grew 6.3% in the quarter, roughly 100 basis points ahead of our expectations. Broader strength in Turkey coupled with increased demand in Russia related to the World Cup helped drive results. For the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single-digit range as strong trends across Continental Europe are somewhat tempered by softer transient performance in the UK. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was roughly flat as softening leisure and group demand in the U.A.E. offset improving trends in Egypt. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be within our system-wide guidance range. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.3% in the quarter, partially driven by strong leisure demand across resort properties. RevPAR in Greater China grew more than 11% in the quarter with occupancy increasing over 8%. For full year 2018, we continue to expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the high single-digit range, with RevPAR growth in China of 12% to 13%. Moving to our guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 3% to 4% consistent with our last call, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.07 billion to $2.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. Guidance is modestly higher factoring for the second quarter beat with some offset from FX and timing. We forecast diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $2.64 to $2.71. For the third quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 2.5% to 3%, slightly lower than our full year range due to July 4 and Jewish holiday shifts. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $540 million to $560 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.71 to $0.76. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the second quarter, bringing year-to-date dividends to $92 million, and have returned a total of approximately $1.6 billion year-to-date. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the third quarter. For 2018, we now expect to return between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our second quarter results and our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up related to your question. Denise, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Certainly, Mr. Jacobs. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question this morning will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please, go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Harry.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hello, and first question just relates to the sequentially lower third quarter RevPAR outlook. To what degree is that entirely related to the holiday shifts or to some degree are you being cautious possibly because of potential weakness caused by the trade war?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It is the former, not the latter, but maybe worthy of a little bit of commentary to give a little bit more color to perspective on fundamentals, which I suspect will continue to come up. So, I'd say, by and large, we feel really good about the fundamentals, and it's driven by exactly what you would expect, and that is the basic setup of supply and demand. Demand is growing at a decent pace for whole a bunch of reasons around the world. Here in the U.S., I think still benefiting from post-Tax Reform world where a lot of cash is going back into the system, a lot more investment is occurring, corporate profitability is growing, and companies are spending more money. And so demand is growing. Supply, I think, if you look at all the data has sort of hit a point where it's diminishing. So, I think this year will be the peak in supply in the U.S. that 2% every expectation that it's going to go down. So, we're benefiting and so the statement of the obvious, we're benefiting from the laws of economics when demand is growing better than supply. I think that's going to continue for a period of time. How long? We don't know, but certainly we feel confident about this year. And honestly, we feel confident about the setup going into next year. On the last call, technically we gave guidance of 2% to 4%, I guess, in the written form. But on the call, we provided an overlay, which was I felt like we'd probably do more likely 3% to 4%, and that was on the basis of the beginning of some decent trends that we were starting to see in a couple of areas of the business, importantly business transient and the group side, and that we were optimistic in what we were seeing and hopeful that those would continue. The good news is they have, okay? So, when I look at the three big segments of our business, leisure transient has been strong over the last bunch of years, and it continues to hang in there nicely. If you look at business transient, last year, I've said it many times, it was, I would argue, very weak because of a lot of uncertainty in the broader economic environment. We, at the beginning of this year, started to pick up. In the second quarter, we clearly saw a continuation of that trend and we're seeing it now, and we expect to continue to see it throughout the rest of the year. And I think group somewhat speaks for itself in our prepared comments. Q2 is very strong. But we're seeing basically an improving trend in the group side. So, I think, there are lots of good reasons for optimism. I feel very good about the rest of the year, and frankly, I feel very good about the setup going to next year. So, then why Q3 and Q4, and why the second half of the year, which I've read a bunch of the analyst reports that seems where everybody's focused on? We're year-to-date 3.9%. We guided 3% to 4%. So, that implies some lower level of expectation for the second half of the year. I'll cover both, the third and the fourth quarter. Third quarter, Harry, I know this is more than you asked, but all this needed to be said. Third quarter is really holiday shift. I mean the 4th of July fell on the worst day of the week it can fall on. When it falls on a Wednesday, it blows the whole week apart. My guess is nobody on this call was traveling for business that week, nobody in this room was, and nobody on Earth it seems, well, nobody in the United States anyway was. So, you have a very weak start to the quarter. You end the quarter in a weak way in the sense that Jewish holidays are moving both day of week and within the month, moving up to a more impactful time, and that when we look at the math, that's all that's happening. If you sort of as best we can cleanse for those things, things are moving along just fine. All of the optimism that we had in my earlier commentary about the various segments holds true as we go into the second half of the year. Fourth quarter is just a matter of honestly – maybe a touch of conservatism honestly, that is based on the fact that the comps are harder, and those are partly driven by the weather comps. All the hurricane activity did create an updraft in results in the fourth quarter. You also were starting to get the early benefits from some of the passage of Tax Reform and clarity around tax policy in the United States, which gave a bit of a boost. And so, I will be the first to say, as we look at that, third quarter I think is reasonably, because it's upon us and we've already experienced 4th of July, I think that's reasonably easy to forecast. Fourth quarter is harder. Those things are little bit more difficult to pin down. So, there could be a touch of conservatism built into that. But I would not want to leave anybody with the impression that we somehow think things are weakening because of trade wars or anything else. We feel pretty darn good for the reasons I described about what's going on with the underlying business. I've actually sat here with our team, preparing for this, and as I do every Monday morning, and I'll stop on this, and asked are we seeing any impact of the sabre-rattling that's going on, on the trade wars in any of our markets? Are we seeing any patterns of bookings, either business transient, leisure, or group in particular? Are we seeing any impact in our China business on the development side, on the operating side? And so far the answer is we are not seeing anything that we can measure. And I think things are progressing as they have been and we feel good about the remainder of the year. And as I said, we feel pretty darn good about the setup, all things being equal, for next year.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Very good and quick one for Kevin. Can you just walk us through the sequential lift in G&A? My guess is that much of that is non-cash, but probably requires a little bit more detail.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Harry. As you point out, it is largely non-cash and largely below EBITDA. So, it's really three things. The implementation or the effect of the new accounting standard related to pension accounting moves some benefit from out of G&A and into another below the line item. There's some FX in there and then a little bit of stock comp, and that's it.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you for the exhaustive answers to the first question, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sorry about that. I answered now that everybody wanted to ask that, Joe. So now, I have answered everybody's question.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: So to add on that slightly, when you think about your three major buckets, leisure and corporate transient and group, which do you see as the relative outperformers in the second half, given the relative outperformance of group versus the other two in the 2Q?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think for the second half of the year and for the full year, you will ultimately see group outperform all segments. It will probably go group, leisure transient, business transient. So group will be the outperformer. It has been in the first half of the year. I think it will be in the second half of the year. I think leisure transient, business transient year-to-date, and best that we can forecast, will be pretty darn close, but I think leisure will eclipse it by a bit. The most important point in that though, and I covered it a bit in my soliloquy there a few minutes ago, is that business transient is much better than it'd been. Last year, you were talking about 1%, 1.5% if you were lucky. This year, I think for the full year we expect it to be more like 3%, so a material uptick from where we were. Leisure has been strong. So, leisure is going to be likely about where it's been the last couple years, and then group is going to be realistically 4%-plus. So, figure transient will be 3%-plus a little bit maybe, and group will be 4%-plus a little bit in the end.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And then, Kevin, a quick follow-up; what was the diluted share count at the end of the quarter, the absolute diluted share count, not the average?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, hold on one second, Joe. I just don't want to give you the wrong number; 303 million.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: That's the average or the absolute share count at the quarter end?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's weighted average. Oh, you want the absolute?
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah, what it was at June 30.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I don't have that in front of me, Joe. I'm sorry. We'll get it to you.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Okay. Thank you, both of you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hold on. We got it. What is it?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: 298 million.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: 298 million.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, guys, good morning, and thanks for taking my question.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Morning.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: You guys spoke and, Chris, you provided some helpful color around the build in the pipeline. If I recall earlier in the year, maybe the outlook on signings in the year was a little bit down from I believe the number was 108,000 last year. With the exception of some of the strength you've seen in Europe, and the strength in conversion activity that you referenced, is there anything else that you're seeing in the trajectory of your signings and development overall that has you more or less encouraged than maybe last time we spoke?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I think you covered the big ones. Europe and the Middle East were very helpful. Conversions obviously are a big focus in a tightening lending environment. So, we're pleased with that. I'd say the other thing that has outstripped expectations, particularly in an environment where construction costs have been going up at a very high rate. I think the number that I got last week was from our team is that year-to-date construction costs have gone up 7% or 8%, and that's off of a 10% increase last year. And so, you have cost going up in an environment where lending standards have tightened, and while RevPAR is growing, it's not growing enough to keep up with that. And so, you've seen, obviously, a decline in what's going on in the U.S. So, we started the year, all that being said, feeling like in the U.S. we would sign fewer deals. We would get more than our fair share given the strength of the brands and the market share of the brands, but that the whole market was going to go down. In reality, what looks like is going to happen based on our forecasting at this point is the whole market's going to go down in terms of signings so we're going to be relatively flat in the U.S. So, that's how we're doing better is we'll be probably down a little bit, but not as much. So, Europe, Middle East up, Asia Pacific doing fine, the U.S. maybe down, but very modestly, and down less than we would have thought.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, thank you. That's helpful. And then if I could just one follow-up on the same topic. As you look at the pipeline and you look at kind of your under construction right now, and you kind of extrapolate out to 2019, is there the potential then to see somewhat of an acceleration in your net unit growth in 2019 relative to the 6.5% you're guiding to for 2018?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. We get that question a lot. I think as we said at our Investor Day a couple of years ago, and I've said pretty consistently, we're really comfortable in the 6% to 7% range when we look at all factors. There are dynamics that have certainly changed over the last couple years, since we sort of gave that range in terms of what's going on in the U.S. As I just described what's going on in Europe, what's going on in Asia Pacific, it's a dynamic situation. But when we look at it overall, I think that we're in that zone for the next few years, and when we look at what's under construction, we look at the opportunities in the conversion world. And we look at building off a higher base because every year that goes by, we're getting bigger and it gets harder. That's sort of the range that we're comfortable with. I would not want to guide people to 7% or above. Having said it, it's not impossible, but I want to be clear in saying that is not where we would guide you. We're going to end up in the middle of the range this year and I think everything is sort of lining up in terms of what we think that's under construction that's going to deliver next year, and what we think we can drum up in conversion activity to put us in that same range. So, hopefully, obviously, we always want to be to the mid to the high point of that range. But I think it will be within that range.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thanks. This is I guess a follow-up to that line of questioning. So, you mentioned rising construction cost, tightening financing markets. At the same time, it seems like we keep hearing that the transaction environment for existing hotels has been heating up and perhaps valuation moving a little bit higher. What do you think is driving that dichotomy and what are the ramifications kind of going forward for your pipeline as you kind of put down your brand on that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think it's those things that are driving it combined with one other, which is that the debt markets for existing assets are incredibly fluid right now. So, debt markets for new construction are much more limited. Cost to build has gone up at a high rate. So, what do people do? They want to be active transactionally. They're looking at a cost to build going up and cost to buy that could potentially be lower than a cost to build, and it's very financeable. So, it's not at all surprising that you would see more transaction activity. We're seeing more change of controls. My expectation is in this environment you're going to continue to see more of that. Implications for our pipeline are, as you can see, this has been happening over the last couple of years. I think our expectations we're going to continue to grow the pipeline. We need to continue to grow the pipeline in order to deliver the 6% to 7% net unit growth, and I would say notwithstanding the fact that the U.S. will I think continue to be under pressure in the sense of development activity broadly slowing down. And even though we'll get more than our fair share of it, it will be hard to fight that trend. It's a big world and that's the whole point of being strategic about how we deploy resources around the world that things move in different rhythms around the world. And as much as things are slowing down here, there's still tremendous opportunity for us in other parts of the world, notably in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa and clearly in Asia Pacific. And so, this is in my now coming up on 11 years that I've been here looking at the stats, we've seen this cycle. This will be the third time we've effectively seen this cycle, where U.S. goes up, U.S. goes down. Things come up and down. And we I think then try to be very strategic and I think have demonstrated I think our ability to be successful in an environment that's dynamic by making sure that we're taking advantage of opportunities elsewhere. So, you're going to see the U.S., look at all the Smith Travel numbers and lodging kind of metrics and everybody's numbers, they all show that supply numbers are going down in the next couple of years. And I think they're all right for the reasons that we talked about. But good news is the world's a big place and I think we've set ourselves up very well to continue to be able to be quick on our feet and make sure that we're continuing to grow at a great pace.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful color. And I guess as an unrelated follow-up, I think it's been a little bit over a quarter maybe in two with the new credit card programs we launched, I guess what are you seeing from the consumer in terms of signups and usage following the introduction?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so far so good, Stephen. It's still, again, it's still early days, but the cards are being well received by consumers and they do drive, well, more hotel use and more spend in our system overall once people signup for the card. So, all good so far there.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey, good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Maybe to stick with the discussion around kind of pipeline, and what's going on there, you mentioned the conversion activity. I think you said, the numbers are quite strong in the quarter. Could you just help us break out a little bit more of like kind of the economics there? So, like how much shorter are these typically in the pipeline? And then, what's sort of driving the independents' decision to kind of affiliate right now, and just sort of what's the value proposition on their end?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Shaun, it's Kevin. Well, to start off with the easy one, on average, convergence end up being in the pipeline for around six months, so much shorter delivery time, and that's for obvious reasons because the hotel doesn't have to get built. I'd say, what's driving overall – the question from before around transaction activity tends to drive a better environment for conversions. You just have more contracts that become available on a sale, or more often than not, a new owner might have a different perspective on which brand they want to affiliate. So, it tends to drive – an active transaction environment tends to drive more conversion activity. And then the independent to branded trade is just around the power of the network effect and our ability to drive market share. And yes, you're adding on fees. But if we can drive higher net revenue – net of the incremental fees, then we tend to find owners that want to affiliate with us. And that's been going on, and will continue to go on. But in my opinion at least, a healthier transaction environment can drive more conversion.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean I think ultimately that we'll continue to see increases in volume, and the value proposition is our average market share in our systems are 114%, and most very rarely with independent hotels drive that kind of market share. And so, we have an ability to drive revenues. We also, even though almost all of these end up being franchise, not all of them, but the bulk of them, we have a very positive impact on their cost structures, notwithstanding the fact they got to pay us. They get it back in share and they get it back in distribution cost efficiencies, because the traditional independent hotel becomes very, not all, but most, very heavily reliant on OTA business, and they pay a lot higher exchange rate than we do. So, they get to not only come into the system and get the benefit of all of the direct relationships we have with customers, but for the much lower percentage of the business, they do depend on the OTAs for they pay a lot less for it. So, you get higher market share, top line, much greater efficiency in distribution cost, and they can afford to pay us and make a lot more money.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And just as a follow-up because I think this topic's relevant, just like as distribution costs are becoming just an ever more clear discussion, and obviously the large brands like yourself are doing I think a better job of breaking these out and helping owners themselves, kind of really think about the economics here. Does this discussion come up more as a bigger sticking point than it was three, five, 10 years ago in your experience around kind of the conversion conversation? How focused are potential signups and conversions on the distribution piece of the equation?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: By the way, I wouldn't say it didn't come up five or seven years ago. It did. But it is a significant part of the discussion in almost every case now in a really positive way for us, in the sense that we are delivering so much of the revenue centrally through our systems and we are not dependent in the same way as others or certainly independents on the intermediaries. And because of our scale, we have a good deal where we do depend on it. And so, this is clearly part of the equation. I'd say, Kevin's point is right. It generally starts with a market share. I'd say it's in the order that I talked about it. First and foremost is people are trying to drive top line, and then a very close second is the distribution cost discussion. Obviously, we compare generally quite favorably to their existing setup.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please, go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning, and thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. So, I just had a couple of questions related on your international business. First, you guys outperformed the STR data in Europe, and a lot of us were pretty focused on the slowdown we saw in Italy and Spain in the quarter, just in the industry data. So, I'm just wondering if you could help us understand what's going on there and talk about your outperformance in the market.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean of course the outperformance because we're better, kidding. Well, we hope we are better. We are driving...
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: (37:00).
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: The reality is that our outperformance, kidding aside, in the quarter was that we had massive share gains. Frankly, we had massive share gains. We had share gains across the board in every major region of the world. Our share gains in APAC and EMEA were outstanding. And so, our outperformance versus the market is because of our strength of the brands, market share, and commercial strategy. So, a big thanks to all of our teams that are helping drive these strategies. If you look at it, I know there's been a lot of discussion about international slowing down, I've sort of had people asking me that it's not really what we're seeing. If you sort of just like whenever – quarter-to-quarter, there's always things sort of moving around that affect things. But if you look at the whole year, which cleanses not all, but most stuff, the international business for us, everything outside the U.S. for the full year is going to be almost exactly where we ended up last year. They will be made up a little bit differently, region, geography by geography, but when you look at it, it will be within a tenth of a point of where we ended up last year. And so, what's really happening if you look at last year, we ended up at 2.5%, I need to take the midpoint of our guidance, we're saying we're going to be at 3.5%. Hopefully we do better. But that's what the midpoint of our guidance would be. It's basically the international performing almost identically last year, which of course was quite good, and the U.S. business is getting better, and that's the simple story of what's going on. I said it I think on our last call. I mean the thing that we are really pleased to see over these last few years, I don't have the exact data points in my head, Kevin may, but if you look at what we've been doing over the last couple of years and the last few quarters in APAC and EMEA, for the first time ever, our market share numbers have eclipsed our U.S. market shares. And so, this is really a testimonial of the fact that the network effect is being built out outside of the United States and it's working. Our U.S. market share is industry-leading on average. So, those are really good numbers. But in APAC and EMEA, our market share numbers are crushing it. And that is a wonderful testimonial to the work the teams are doing. But it's a great leading indicator when you talk about 40% – signings up 40% in EMEA. The reason it's happening is because the share numbers are growing like crazy and we're attracting more owner, attracting more capital by virtue of owners wanting to invest more in the system because they're seeing this and they want to invest to jump on the bandwagon, and invest with us to make more money. So, certainly, we've had reason to believe good outperformance in the sense of gaining share over the last few years, and then second quarter was really, really big share. But I have an expectation, we'll continue to gain share as we go forward in the international stage.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. But your outperformance aside, is there anything going on in those two markets, Italy and Spain, just in terms of the data we saw in the quarter, or like you said should we just look at it more holistically in terms of the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'll be honest. I haven't studied Italy and Spain for the quarter. When we met with our teams, which I did across the globe last week, there was nothing that was pointed out to me that was anomalous stick in those markets or that whatever happened that won't sort of clear itself up by the end of the year.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thanks. And then just my follow-up. So, you kind of just went through why you're outperforming. Just wondering and maybe getting a little bit greedy, how long do you think you can generate the RevPAR growth as mid to high single digits in Europe and Asia? And how far may you be from the prior peaks in terms of inflation adjusted pricing in some of those markets?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's of course really hard. I don't have that crystal ball. I think that those markets – let's take them one at a time. Europe is a big place, lots of different things going on. The UK has been a little bit weaker, being compensated for with strength in other parts of Europe, Germany in particular, Turkey coming off of easy comps and issues that have started to stabilize. My expectation is that both as a consequence of sort of things being reasonably steady other than the Brexit situation, but reasonably steady in our ability to continue to drive commercial performance that we're going to drive better performance there than honestly we can drive here, even though U.S. is getting better, and Asia Pacific clearly, I think that will be the case just because I think the dynamic of those economies is even though we can debate China is growing a little bit slower and there are issues in Japan and the like in Southeast Asia, you could debate. The reality is those as across the board, the Asian economy is going to be growing at a faster pace than most economies around the world for the foreseeable future, maybe slower than they have a little bit, but faster than the rest of the world. So, I think we're going to continue to see an ability to drive really good performance there. And if we do our job, we're going to outperform by continuing to have strategies that deliver incremental market share. So, I think for the next couple of years, I feel reasonably good barring unforeseen circumstances.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks so much.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, and, Felicia, I'd just add, and it's not that you can't see a slowdown in Asia or anywhere in Asia, but outside of mature markets like Japan, prior peak is probably not the right way to think about it. In a lot of cases, we're still – it's an emerging market story...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: In mature markets.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: ...and we're establishing these markets, especially in the middle market, where the business will continue to mature and rates will continue to grow, albeit within the context of economic cycles. But I'm not sure prior peak is the right way to think about it in Asia.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah, that's fair. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. You made some positive comments around group production in the quarter. Can you just talk about your 2019 group base, and how it makes you feel about 2019? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: 2019 feels pretty good. So, I think the comment we made, we were up in the high single digits, low double digits for all periods forward in the quarter, all bookings forward on the group side, and into 2019. So, I think – I don't have the numbers sitting in front of me, but we're mid-single digits this year. I think we're mid-single digits, maybe even a little bit better, for next year. So, the group feels pretty good. And frankly, if we look out, obviously, it's a diminishing percentage of bookings in terms of the overall bookings, ultimately that will occur in any year as you go forward to 2020, 2021, et cetera. But you look at the numbers in the next two or three years and they all look pretty good, and getting better.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please, go ahead.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks. I just had a question on your 2018 guidance. With the RevPAR increase the midpoint, would it seem like maybe a higher EBITDA increase? And I know your fee growth rate for the full year didn't go up. I think you said maybe there were some factors in Q2 that were timing that wouldn't. They were maybe sort of borrowing a little bit from future quarters. But I know your SG&A went up a little higher, but even just at the EBITDA line, can you talk about what else might be happening on a full year basis where maybe we would have thought the RevPAR increase would have meant a little more of an EBITDA raise?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Robin. It's Kevin. First of all, the G&A increase is, like I said, largely non-EBITDA. So, that's really not having an impact. So, roundly, it's a pretty simple story. Of the $15 million beat, about a third or so of it was timing. We've got about a $10 million lesser of a tailwind in the back half of the year from FX. So, that kind of gets you back to the same midpoint. And we increased the back part of the year by $5 million. So, that's really the story.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please, go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. I'm left with just a couple of small questions here (46:09). Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Any update on timing for the Waldorf? And are you collecting in New York and are you collecting any fees from that currently? And then the second question is whether you have any commentary on the negotiations on the union contracts.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: In New York, the Waldorf Anbang continues to move ahead. But, first of all, we are not collecting any fees, zero fees. So, only upside when the Waldorf reopens. They are moving forward with all of the demolition work that needs to be done. They are moving forward with the contract documents for all the renovation, and they have said to us that when they complete those things, which they're working away at, they intend to execute on a plan for the renovation. I think the expectation is that's probably likely possibly late this year, I think more likely early next year. I think it was reported publicly lately. So, it's consistent with what they've said to us. They are looking to sell a whole bunch of other U.S.-based assets, including, which was reported, the Strategic Hotels, but their intention was not to sell the Waldorf. That's what's been reported. That's what they've told us directly. So, they're moving ahead. No real comment on union negotiations. We work really hard to maintain what we think is a very good and productive relationship with the unions, and different markets come up at different times where it's basically in a constant discussion with them on a whole bunch of different things, not just when contracts are up. So, nothing really incremental to report relative to that.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Chris, if I could just follow up on the Waldorf, I assume that's a three or four-year build-out process once they do get started. Is there any thought to...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, once they get started, it should be three. I don't think it's four. I guess it could, but because there's a lot of work to be done, but the building's there. You can't touch the – you got to clean up and improve the exterior, but the base building is there. So, you do take some of the timeline out because of that. But I think right now the schedule looks like three years or less.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Is there any thought on your part to opening another Waldorf in New York, a different part of New York, maybe just to have that presence?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Not at this time. Obviously, we're going to be opening another Conrad in New York, in Midtown here in the not too distant future. So, we'll have two Conrads in New York. But I think the idea is in New York, the Waldorf should be – the Waldorf Astoria in New York should be the only Waldorf Astoria in New York. If at some point – I do not expect this to be the case, but if at some point, it is clear that Anbang is not moving forward or it's going to be a significantly extended timeframe, then that's something that we would have to be intelligent about and consider.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, guys. Chris, I'm just quite curious about your thoughts on the cycle, specifically what does the shift in your net unit growth towards conversions and maybe a little bit away from development tell you about the future of net unit growth or components of RevPAR growth? Does it foreshadow a shift in your mind?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I don't think so, Jeff. I mean I think if I look at the – again, even in the 11 years I've been here sort of the cycle of what's going on with the pipeline, obviously our net unit growth has grown throughout that time. And the complexion of it has changed and the pipeline has changed a lot. But the patterns have been relatively consistent. And so I don't think it really foreshadows much of anything. I think it's back to what I said. It's a big world and there are lots of ways for us to be able to grow in ways that are great for our customers and giving them more opportunities to stay with us and great for all of our shareholders because we drive more profitability as we do it. And so, conversions are one way we do that. It is largely a western experience. Although, there are some examples in other parts of the world where we – in the Middle East and Asia, where you will see us do some conversions. The bulk of it really will occur in the United States and Western Europe, and I think as a natural – it's a natural consequence of what's going on in the broader environment just in the U.S. as we've discussed, there's just less stuff getting built and I think independent hotels that have more I would argue more of an incentive in this environment to focus on trying to work with somebody like us and getting to the system to be able to drive greater profitability. So, no, it's a long winded rambling way of saying I don't think there's anything particularly unique about what we're seeing in conversions. Conversions as an overall percentage of our NUG actually are still towards the lower end of the range. I mean if you go back in 2009 and 2010, coming out of the Great Recession, where you find conversions pick up a bunch, it was over 40% of our NUG. You look at it last year, it was roughly 20%. I think when we finish the year this year, it will be probably mid-20%s, maybe not even quite, but somewhere around 25%. So, it's still not in a relative sense compared to where I've seen it. It's still not anywhere near the high watermarks. I think when you see – if and when, I mean I guess it's always when because business cycles eventually turn, although it doesn't certainly feel like that's happening anytime soon. When that happens, I think that's when you would see an incremental surge in activity and conversions because when times get much tougher, people look for shelter. And the fact that we have very high market share can drive more efficient distribution costs, works now really well and works even better when you're in a down cycle because people are even more focused on it.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think all of that said, it will be hard for us to get back into sort of the mid-40%s in terms of percentage of conversions just because we have a much more mature development strategy today than we did back...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean I don't think we'll ever get there. Yes, that's a good add-on because I didn't mean to imply we would. That was in a different era for this company, much lower NUG, number one, just a much lower number, and number two, yeah, they have a much less mature development strategy. But I think in a down cycle, we clearly go up to a 30%. We can easily get to 30%. I doubt it would go a whole heck of a lot higher than that.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: That's useful. And just maybe a second question on pricing power. I know customers never relish paying more. But just the occupancy in the U.S. is near a about 20, 30-year peak and the ingredients are certainly there for an outsized response and rate growth to incremental demand that we're seeing particularly in certain markets. I was curious if you have any kind of anecdotes or experience that you're seeing right now around what the response has been from group and corporate customers to stomach price increases. I mean do you think there's a little bit of a delayed response either this year or maybe it increases next year? Just feels like the things hold together, we can see accelerating rate driven growth RevPAR and just wondering what feedback or how you think your customers are expecting that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I think the answer is yeah, I do think you're going to continue to see as you did last year and as I think you will this year in the U.S., the bulk of our RevPAR growth is coming in rate. It may not be supercharged rate growth, but I think last year and I think it will end up this year about the same play like 70% of our RevPAR growth is coming in the form of rate. There's still weaker shoulder period weekends. We're getting occupancy even though it's at very high levels historically because I think we're a lot smarter about how to fill off peak times, which we want to keep doing. So in theory, if we get smarter and smarter, better at that, we're going to be able to drive some incremental occupancy all the time because we still have plenty of capacity in shoulder periods and particularly on weekends. No matter what we do, we still have capacity. So, you always want to see a little bit of occupancy growth because we should be trying to fill every room we can. Rate growth is the bulk of it. I think you'll continue to see that. And yeah, here's what I'd say that if trade, sabre-rattling aside, you started out this year – ended last year, started out this year with a much more positive psychology in the business environment, people have a easier regulatory goal that they've got a lot – they have clarity on tax policy at least for now, they have a lot more dollars in their pocket to spend, they're investing it, just the psychology is better, the confidence is better. And in that environment, people are willing to spend more money. They're less rigid about, it gives you more pricing power just because also the economics, but also the psychology that they're just willing to spend more. So, I do think if this momentum continues in the psychology and the business community is good as it has been, it will give you the ability to translate that into some incremental pricing power. You were starting to see it in a sense in – you could argue what we just described in the group space is the precursor to that, right, in the sense that you're seeing over the last two or three quarters a big uptick in the group space of people being willing to not only book in the moment for the moment groups, but out multiple years. What does that suggest? That suggests this has more positive view in the business community about what the future holds. And I think that is a decent precursor to the fact that their confidence is going to translate into more spending, broader uptick in economic growth. And I think what goes with that is an expectation that you got to pay more for some products and services, including ours. So, I don't want to get ahead of myself and saying it's going to be a bonanza, but I think, if this momentum continues, I do think it allows you to build incrementally just because of the laws of supply and demand a little bit of incremental pricing power. How much, it will depend on how much momentum, how much strength in the economy and for how long.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please, go ahead.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. You had gone over in length your thoughts of the no impact so far on bookings from the fears around trade war. How about the recent uptick in gas prices? Are you seeing any impact at all perhaps on your midscale brands for the summer leisure travel?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, we're really not, Pat. The U.S. consumer still feels pretty strong and I think everything is just fine on that front.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. That's it. Quick question. Thanks.
Operator: And the next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please, go ahead.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about reaching 100 million Honors members, I guess, I think by next year. And you recently – a property in Jamaica changed hands and will move to an all-inclusive model. And just how are you thinking about expanding into that space particularly as you have more customers who presumably are going to want to use their points and the all-inclusive space seems to be gaining traction with consumers and are you just sort of seeing that you make as kind of a test case? Or what are your thoughts around that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, it's a good question. We like the AI space in the sense we've been in it for a very long time in a fairly modest way in the sense that a number of our existing hotels largely centered on the Hilton brand, a little bit within the DoubleTree brand have had an all-inclusive sort of approach and pricing structure, including in Jamaica, but also in other parts of the world, in parts of Europe, in parts of the Middle East, Egypt resorts being one notable geography. And so, we like it. We've been doing a bunch of work to figure it out, and I think the expectation is that we will – that is something that in certain locations, not broadly across the world, but in certain geographies, that is something that customers want. We do think it is a benefit from an Honors' point of view, because it's a place that Honors' numbers can redeem in too and a bunch of – enough of them want to do it. So, I'm not going to make a big announcement on we're going to create an AI brand today. It's something we spend a lot of time on. I think you should expect to see us do more in that space. We are now figuring out exactly how we're going to do that. Exactly how we're going to do, it means how we're going to do it as we've been doing it with existing brands, and do it at a sort of higher volume, or would we create sub-brands within those brands that are purely focused on AI. And we don't, I'm being perfectly transparent, we don't have any answer to that yet, but you will certainly see us for I think all the right reasons those that you described, which is some customers want it. You'll see it doing more in that space, and more to come there over the next few months.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned some of the group booking patterns into next year. Have you seen any change, just given the way that group commissions are going to change through third-party bookings? Has that do you think accelerated any bookings or is that not really that meaningful overall?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, I mean that's very hard for us to track. I've asked that very question of my teams many, many times. As far as we can track and the best data I have, we don't think that there's been any material impact from the change in commission structure. My guess is there's a little bit of impact, just because naturally there should be and it's sort of hard to discern scientifically, so it's more atmospherically. But our folks think that the momentum is being driven by sort of the core underlying fundamentals of more positive psychology, just people feeling better, being willing to make decisions on bookings, because they're more confident about the future and not much to do about commission structures.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. All right, thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. As always, we appreciate you spending an hour of your morning with us. Pleased with our second quarter, as I said, feeling good about the setup for the rest of the year, and frankly going into next year. We'll look forward to talking to you after the third quarter, the report on all matters. And I hope everybody enjoy the end of your summer. Take care. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good day and welcome to the Hilton First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Nicole. Welcome to Hilton's first quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will then review our first quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Jill, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We're happy to report a great start to the year. Results were better than expected with RevPAR, adjusted EBITDA and EPS all exceeding the high end of our guidance. Out-performance across all major segments and geographies contributed to the strong quarter and our results continued to demonstrate the strength of our simplified fee-based business model. With the solid top-line performance and a model that requires low levels of capital to grow, we continued to generate strong free cash flow, allowing us to execute on our capital return strategy. Earlier this month, we repurchased 16.5 million shares from HNA Group in connection with their secondary offering. With this offering, they have now fully exited their investment in Hilton. Year-to-date, we have returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. This morning, we raised our full year capital return guidance range to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, or approximately 7% of our market cap. Turning to results, in the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.9%, nearly 200 basis points above the midpoint of guidance. Upside was driven by U.S. and international markets, with out-performance across all three major segments: corporate transient, leisure transient, and group. Trends generally accelerated versus last quarter, boosted by improving economic growth and increasing international inbound travel to the U.S., which was up 9% in the quarter. Group bookings, which provide some visibility into forward-looking trends, also suggest the positive momentum from the fourth quarter of last year is continuing into 2018 with new demand and improved conversions driving a 20% increase in first quarter bookings for all future periods. In the quarter, food and beverage revenue growth of roughly 6% exceeded RevPAR growth and outpaced expectations given better group business and increased spend. Booking windows continue to lengthen and group position remains up in the mid-single digits for the year. Recent forecasts for U.S. GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment have accelerated versus prior estimates, which should provide further favorable fundamentals. Given this set up, we're raising our full year RevPAR guidance a 100 basis points to 2% to 4%, with the likely result more in the 3% to 4% range. We are also seeing continued positive momentum with development. We ended the first quarter with 355,000 rooms in our pipeline, representing 41% of our existing base, the largest percentage in the industry. When completed, we estimate our pipeline will generate more than $700 million of stabilized, annual adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of approximately 6.5%. With nearly 45% of estimated openings located in international markets, we expect to increase our international room supply more than 10% by year-end, led by the Asia Pacific region where we estimate portfolio growth in the high teens. China continues to be an important driver of our success in the region. On average, we sign a new hotel in China every three days, and Hampton has the fastest growing pipeline across all international hospitality brands in the country. The market represents approximately 4% of our existing supply, but 24% of our pipeline, with a large majority already under construction. Elsewhere in the region, we also expanded our partnerships with leading local developers. In India, we continue to grow our pipeline, which will more than double our presence in this critical market over the next few years. In the quarter, we opened the Conrad Bengaluru in India. The 285-room luxury hotel is conveniently located in the central business district and offers world-class dining options and the largest meeting and event spaces in the city. In the Middle East and Africa region, our pipeline stands at 130 hotels, totaling approximately 34,000 rooms. During the quarter, we celebrated notable openings from Saudi Arabia to Sub-Saharan Africa to Egypt where we raised the Hilton flag over the Hilton Cairo Heliopolis and converted the hotel's luxury tower to Africa's first Waldorf Astoria. We look forward to celebrating additional openings throughout the year, including welcoming our first Hampton to the Middle East, an important milestone as we work towards our goal of tripling our footprint in the Middle East in the next several years. Our pipeline in Europe composes nearly 200 hotels and 31,000 rooms, and we continue to identify opportunities across both new and existing brands. In the first quarter, we opened the Hilton Lake Como, marking our first property in the area and demonstrating our commitment to expanding an iconic and exciting resort destination. We also began development on our first Canopy in continental Europe, which is scheduled to open in Croatia's capital, Zagreb, later this year. We recently welcomed our newest addition to the Canopy Brand, a little closer to home. The Canopy Washington, D.C. Bethesda North opened in March to tremendous support from the local community and exceptionally positive feedback from guests. In U.S., more broadly, Tru and Home2 continue to lead our development story, accounting for more than a third of our expected U.S. room openings this year. In the quarter, Tru expanded its footprint to include eight more properties in six new states, with more than 500 hotels open and in various stages of development. Home2 added nearly a dozen new properties to its portfolio in the quarter for a total of 215 trading hotels and a pipeline that will double its size in just the next few years. In the first quarter, we added more than 3 million new Honors members, up 26% year-over-year. This brings our total program to 74 million members who now drive 59% of system-wide occupancy, up 220 basis points in the quarter. We're always exploring new ways to serve our guests through enhanced technology and customer experiences. Scaling Digital Key continues to be an important part of that effort. More than 3,100 properties and 512,000 rooms, or approximately 60% of our global system, are now enabled with the technology to allow guests to open their doors using their smartphones. Our guests have unlocked 6.7 million doors using Digital Key. We also recently rolled out customer-centric pricing in the U.S., a new pricing structure that provides added flexibility for those who want it and cost savings for those who don't. We anticipate this new pricing model will reduce the number of last minute cancellations and maximize the number of guest rooms available. Customer-centric pricing will be available at all properties globally later this summer. Overall, we're very pleased with the strong start to the year and optimistic on the set-up going forward, as solid economic growth, combined with our industry-leading brands, robust development pipeline, and capital-light model should continue driving strong operational performance and shareholder returns. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to thank all of our team members for their continued hard work and dedication in making us one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For, marking our third consecutive year we've been included on the list. We were also named one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere Institute, highlighting our commitment to leading with integrity. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give a little bit more details on our results in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.9% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Both rate and occupancy drove performance with particularly strong demand at our international hotels. We estimate weather related benefits partially offset an 80-basis-point drag from the Easter calendar shift. Adjusted EBITDA of $445 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 9% year-over-year. We estimate that roughly one-third of the beat versus the midpoint of guidance came from timing items that will reverse later in the year, with the balance primarily driven by our RevPAR outperformance. As a result, our diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.55 also exceeded expectations. In the quarter, management and franchise fees grew 12% to $463 million, outperforming our 8% to 10% guidance range. RevPAR gains and license fee growth largely drove better than expected results. Our owned and leased portfolio performed in line with expectations, as softness at certain European properties muted the benefits of strength in Japan. Turning to our regional performance and outlook, first quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 2.8%, boosted primarily by solid leisure and corporate transient demand. Growth also benefited from prolonged hurricane-related business. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the lower half of our 2% to 4% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew a solid 7.3% versus the prior year, exceeding expectations given strong leisure trends across Canada. Continued hurricane-related business also aided performance in Puerto Rico. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR in the region to grow in the mid-single-digit range. RevPAR in Europe grew 7.1% in the quarter, roughly 100 basis points higher than our expectations, driven largely by broad strength in group business and continued recovery in Turkey, but tempered by weak leisure and corporate demand in London. We expect full year 2018 RevPAR in Europe to grow in the mid-single digits. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR growth was up 5.3%, given rebounding demand in Egypt and better oil-related business in Kuwait. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be near the high end of our guidance range. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 11% in the quarter, driven by strong transient and group performance, particularly across key cities like Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo, as well as a ramping hotels, which we estimate contributed nearly 300 basis points to growth in the region. The shift in Chinese New Year to earlier in the quarter also boosted results. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the high-single-digit range with RevPAR growth in China of 10% to 11%. Moving to guidance, for full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 4%, and adjusted EBITDA of $2.06 billion to $2.1 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 9% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $2.62 to $2.71. For the second quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 3% to 4%, including an 80 basis point benefit from the Easter calendar shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $530 million to $550 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.66 to $0.70. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Moving on to capital return, we paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the first quarter, for a total of $47 million in dividends and more than $1.3 billion in total capital return year-to-date. As Chris mentioned, this includes our nearly $1.2 billion share repurchase from HNA. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the second quarter. For 2018, we expect to return between $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion to shareholders in the form of buybacks and dividends. Further details on our first quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up related to your question. Nicole, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Chris, going back to your commentary and certainly your guidance, it seems to have – your confidence in 2018 seems to improve. And I'm just wondering if this is just a follow through from fourth quarter, when we saw some better activity, or was there something that was really tangible that you saw in both transient and group business that has driven this confidence?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Bill, good question. I think that's the $64,000 question. Probably we'll get it multiple different ways. Yeah, if you go back to our last call, I think I was reasonably optimistic there, and that was based on the fact that during the fourth quarter, we were starting to see trends that were picking up, both – you had seen leisure transient trends remain strong. While it was choppy, we were starting to see business transient trends showing signs of life in our group pace and position for the year before it started to pick up. I'd say my increasing optimism, which I think you're reading right, is based on the fact that the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter continued into the first quarter, and I would say strengthened. So, breaking the business down into the three major components, leisure transient continue to be strong. Some of it due to the Easter shift and the like, but frankly it was incredibly strong. Business transient, we saw it pick up and stabilize at a higher level. So, while it was choppy in the fourth quarter, it was less choppy, more consistently better. And group continued both, what we're seeing, in pace and position to be strong. So, I think there what we were starting to see and hoped would solidify from fourth to first quarter, we did see. And I think there are a lot of reasons behind it. I think the key reason is what we talked about then, and what we're seeing now, is I think broader macro strength. If you look at all of the data out there, consumer confidence is at very high levels. Business confidence has been increasing and is at reasonably high levels. In a post-tax reform world, you have more money in consumer's pockets, a lot more money in business's pockets. You have a regulatory environment that is more stable. I'd say both in tax and regulatory policy areas, people have a little bit more visibility, a little bit less uncertainty, and that's, in part, what's driving the confidence. And, as a result, you're seeing both consumers on a leisure basis and businesses on a business basis, hire more, spend more, which is driving more demand in our business. So, the question is, for how long and what trajectory it takes, it's early in the year. So, obviously, our optimism is showing up in our increase in guidance at 2% to 4%, but really, if you listen to my comments carefully, I said 3% to 4%, which is a pretty good improvement. So, I think it's showing up there. And we're pretty optimistic that these trends that we see short of something significant that's unanticipated, will continue for a period of time.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful, Chris. And my follow-up question, hopefully it's a quick one, is that your performance in the first quarter was weaker than the U.S. overall results. And I think it is probably a weighting issue between luxury and economy within your portfolio. Correct me if I'm wrong, but does it...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes. I will correct. I think you're wrong.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Does it change the way you think about your presence in the luxury space and maybe the resort space? Is there more urgency to increase your presence there?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, we've always – let me answer the first and the second. I think your assumption is right. It is weighting. If you weighted for our portfolio, we actually beat by, I think, 70 basis points. We were higher on a weighted basis, not lower. The answer to the question on do we have an urgency on increasing our presence in luxury and resorts, of course we do. We have had that urgency for the better part of the last decade and I think we're making tremendous progress both in luxury and in our resort portfolio. But that's an effort that will continue for many, many years to come. Recognizing that quarter to quarter and year to year, by the way, all of the data-shifts has between segments, sometimes the high end is driving it, sometimes it is not. But the reason that we have a very heavy focus on luxury and resorts is just longer term, from the standpoint of having aspirational products in our system for Honors members. We think that it's beneficial. We're in a really good place now. We're open and in the pipeline between Waldorf and Conrad, we have 100 properties and representing almost every major urban and resort destination we want to be in. There are a few gaps that we've been working on. But we have made, I think, tremendous progress in those areas over the last bunch of years.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. I appreciate the time.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yep.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Dobson of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hey, good morning. It's Harry Curtis. Some technical issues here.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Brian.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Yeah, hey Brian. Chris, could you maybe a little bit of more color on Bill's question. As you talk to the CEOs of your customers, what are they saying about how they've loosened their travel budgets? And have you – and they seen – you've seen several cycles. So, how does this differ versus ones that you've seen over the last 20 years?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'll take it in that order. Definitely, and I've been talking with a lot of our customers lately, just because we've had a bunch of different customer events, large and small, and some of our most important largest customers have been quite willing to share their views. I would say, I think that their overarching – I sort of described it in the prior answer, their overarching view is that they're more optimistic. They ultimately are spending more, they're ultimately hiring more and they're feeling better. And I think they feel like they have more visibility in some very important areas that were hanging out there, regulatory and tax, there was a serious lack of clarity on where those things were going over the last bunch of years. So, I think they're feeling good and they are definitely both traveling more in a transient and a group context, and they're spending more. It's at the food and beverage numbers I gave in the prepared comments because I think that's an important note. It's only one quarter, obviously the trends have to start somewhere. But I think it is reflective and as I talked to our teams and I talked to CEOs of – that run a bunch of the companies that are big customers of ours, clearly that confidence is translating in them letting sort of the loosening up on the purse strings. If you talk to the folks in the hotels as the big groups are coming through, people are just spending more on individual events, they're doing more individual events, they're doing coffee breaks that they might have cut out, lots of examples. But, again, it's the quarter, but it's what I think is the beginning of a good trend of the confidence in the business community, translating into higher spend. One of the things that I look at, as I've talked about many times, is non-residential fixed investment. And I mentioned it in the comments. If you look at what's going on with those numbers, those numbers are – year-over-year growth rate is estimated to be up pretty materially, close to 6%. Again, reflective of the fact that corporate America and for that businesses, small, large, medium, are making more investments in plant, equipment, technology, and the like, all of which is great for our business, because it's a very high correlation to demand growth for hotel rooms. So, I don't want to be too much of a Pollyanna, but I'd say, vis-à-vis, if I were talking to these customers a year ago, it was a very different conversation. I mean, they weren't jumping out of buildings, I mean, but they clearly were not as confident as they are today. I mean, it was a fairly stark contrast in conversations today versus a year ago. In terms of the cycle, I mean, I think this has all been pretty well chronicled, but there are some differences. I mean, obviously this cycle has been a lot longer, which I know sort of worries everybody. I'm not sure that it should necessarily. I mean what's happened is it's been a longer cycle, but a much lower growth cycle. If you've look at the RevPAR growth that we've had, and even in our best years and particularly after coming out of one of the greatest recessions, one of the biggest dips in the history or the biggest dip in the history of the business, you would argue it was sort of anemic annual growth. So it was longer, but lower growth. I think that was driven, as has been well chronicled, by just more modest macro growth. You never had big GDP growth years coming out of the great recession. So the economy never really got overly juiced. The financial markets were incredibly disrupted in the great recession, historically so. So they did not provide coming into the recovery a lot of capital for growth of new units. So even though you've had reasonably tepid macro growth, you've had historically low levels of supply that are now, I would argue, 2018 is the peak year in the U.S. for supply, which will peak at the long-term average, which is lower than any peak I can remember in my history. And I think when you look at like 2019 numbers actually you're going to see most forecasts and ours agree with this, suggest that for the full year 2019, supply is going to go down back below the long-term average. So I think that's been helpful. You've had multiple re-accelerations, two or three depending on how you look at it. In terms of RevPAR growth. Again, a little bit different. We've had re-acceleration in prior cycles, but I think sort of the anemic nature of this recovery has created a little bit higher beta experience when you're at lower levels of RevPAR growth and things are moving around in the economy, it's created slowdowns and slower periods and acceleration periods. I do believe that in the end, the laws of supply and demand are alive and well. And what we're seeing right now is an acceleration that I think is reasonably sustainable just based on the underlying macro trends that I've covered in a couple of different ways already on the call. And how long that goes on is hard for me to say. I don't have that crystal ball. But as I said, it feels reasonably sustainable, meaning you do not have a supply issue and demand which will follow. Macro growth indicators feels like it is picking up, both in the U.S. and around the world, not like a rocket ship but picking up, and it feels like we have a decent sort of foundation for a reasonable period of time of sustained economic growth, which will support the business. So I think you could have a period of at least a couple of years of good same-store results. I think beyond that, I don't know. It's not that we couldn't. It's just hard to prognosticate that far out.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Chris, thanks. That does it for me.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. I guess following up on the answer to that last question, looks like you have about $150 million to $350 million of remaining buyback left in the total distribution over the remainder of the year. I guess, in a backdrop where you feel like you might get a little of an extension, how are you thinking about deploying that outstanding buyback? And as a follow-up, if the market does strengthen further, does that change how you think about either the deployment near-term or your target leverage ratio? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Stephen, it's Kevin. I'll take this one. So, I'd say, yeah, you're thinking about it the right way. We've done $1.2 billion of buybacks so far. So if you go $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, less the $200 million dividend, that gets you to $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. So $200 million to $400 million left to deploy for the rest of the year. And, look, that could vary a little bit based on market conditions, but I would say, generally speaking, we would expect that to be pretty even over the balance of the year. And as we told a lot of the folks that we talk to around the HNA offering, we expect to be in the market kind of always, right. And so, in answer to the second part of your question, the way we think about capital return is consistent, and nothing that happens opportunistically is going to change the way we think about capital return more broadly. And, on leverage, I think you asked about leverage. The range of leverage that it would have us at on the guidance range is 3.25 to 3.35 times, and that's by the end of the year. At spot today, we're a little bit over the range we've given in the past of 3 to 3.5 times. But, by the end of the year, we'll be comfortably within the range, given the range of buybacks we've given you.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody. I don't think you answered this question specifically the way I'm asking it, hopefully. Good morning, everybody. Good quarter. But, Kevin, you mentioned before, the U.S. you would expect RevPAR growth of 2% to 3% for the full year. And within that band, how do you see business transient growth relative to group and leisure transient?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. So good question. I think we said lower half, right, which implies 2% to 3%, as you're right. And I would say, business transient was a little bit better in this quarter than it had been in prior quarters, and we expect that to continue. You heard Chris say in his prepared remarks that we see group positioned in the mid-single digits. So that probably realizes at the end of the day to the middle or upper end of the range. We expect leisure to be sort of middle or upper end of the range continued. So that, mathematically, would suggest that business transient would be sort of in the lower half of the range, kind of consistent with our overall U.S. guidance. And it does drive a half or more of the results in the U.S. So that already...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Recognizing there is potential if things continue on the current path for upside in that 1% and 2%. If you really cleanse last year 2017 of all the noise of holidays and the hurricanes and the like, business transient was pretty much flat to up 0.5 point. So pretty materially better in business transient than what we've been experiencing.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And then so the 100 basis points of RevPAR growth guidance change versus three months ago, is it even across the three segments or is it more group and leisure versus business transient?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think it's even. I think if you look at the numbers on the beat in the first quarter, if we look at expectation in our forecasting, which we do hotel by hotel all around the world to aggregate it to our new forecast, I think it's across the board. We think leisure is going to be better than we thought a quarter ago. Business transient is going to be better than we thought. Maybe group a little bit. Maybe we were pretty optimistic on group, honestly, because the position was pretty darn good. So we still feel good, even a little bit better about group. Probably the upside in there is less because we were already factoring for that, but upside definitely in business transient from where we were and leisure transient.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Anthony Powell of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I know it's early, but your new credit cards have been in the market for a few months and they have been well received by the travel community. Have you seen more spending on the cards? And do you think you may be able to get higher fee growth from those cards than you originally forecasted?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, Anthony, it's Kevin again. Yeah, look, your assessment of both, the fact that it's a little early and that the cards have been well received, is accurate. I mean, we've been getting great traction on social media and otherwise in terms of customer feedback about the cards. But it is early days, right. So we expect those cards to be successful and to drive customer engagement and better performance in the hotels and ultimately market share, but it's a little bit too early to say whether the trajectory of what we thought on license fees will be higher than what we've said in the past.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And could you go into more detail about the customer-centric pricing? How that differs from some of the things you tried in the past with longer cancellation fees and member discounts, and what impact do you think that could have on your ADR growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean the idea behind – we've talked about it on a bunch of calls now, we're rolling it out, and by the summer it will be globally rolled out. I think the idea, not unlike other industries, including the airline industry, being a decent model in this regard, is to give customers choice. And instead of having it be a stick, have it be more of a carrot that if you want more flexibility, you're going to pay a little bit more for it, but we'll give you that option. And if you don't need as much, which a lot of customers don't, we'll give you a little bit of an incentive to let us know, so that we can manage our inventory better. So, essentially, what we did was, in a grossly simplified way, is we took what used to be BAR, Best Available Rate, we got rid of that, and we created a fully flexible rate that's higher than the old BAR by a few percentage points. So still, we can tweak these things in lots of different ways and we will continue to tweak these. And then we created a semi-flex product that gives you two to three days generally, where we get two to three days incremental notice on a cancellation beyond our new cancellation policy. And you get circa one or maybe a little bit better discount for allowing us to have that information. We expect that it will materially, based on the testing and we tested this at gobs of hotels, not a few here and there, but hundreds of hotels, that it will reduce cancellations, and we do think that the behavior that we saw in the test will give us a little bit higher ADR, that it will give you a little bit of RevPAR boost. I don't want to get ahead of us. Let us get it rolled out. But it's not the underlying reason that we've done it. We've done it to give customers more choice and to be able to manage inventory better and further reduce cancellations beyond extending our typical cancellation policies. But we do believe it will give us a bit of a ADR and RevPAR boost. I would say modest, but let's see how it goes and we'll report out as it happens.
Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Just wanted to ask two things about the guidance. One is that the fee growth rate is a bit lower in Q2 versus full year, and I don't know if that's just timing of some one-offs that you're comping from last year. And then also you're guiding to a RevPAR growth in Q2 similar to the rate in Q1, although in theory you'd have the benefit of the Easter holiday shift. So perhaps you're just being conservative. But also wondering if maybe you're thinking that there's going to be less of that hurricane demand in Q2. Is that offsetting the Easter benefit and sort of leaving your growth rate similar to Q1 for that reason? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Robin. On the fee growth, it's as you thought. It's timing. I mean last year when we signed – it's timing on a couple of different fronts. But one of the big drivers is last year we signed the Amex credit card deal in the second quarter, and there was a catch-up on the remuneration because the pricing was retroactive to the full year, so just a little bit of a year-over-year headwind there. So nothing much else going on there. On RevPAR, yeah, I mean, basically, we gave the guidance of 3% to 4% in our official guidance, which by definition is higher than our 2% to 4% range. I think you're responding to the fact that Chris is guiding us to the top end of the range, which probably suggests that you take the over on the full year a little bit if you had to, right. So the Easter benefit does flip over, which is why we gave 3% to 4% as the stated guidance. And there probably is a little bit of slow down as the hurricane-related business dissipates. But generally speaking, as we've said, it's not that much different. Group is a little bit stronger in the quarter, which is helping as well. But generally speaking, there's no different trends from second quarter versus the balance of the year.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: With the positive trends you've been seeing both on the RevPAR and in the economic indicators, does this change at all about how you think about delivering net unit growth over the next few years? How you think about delivering net unit growth over the next few years? And I had my notes last quarter, you were talking about 6% to 7%. Any changes in that thought?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I hate to make it too short, but I think we're still comfortable, very comfortable for the next two or three years in the 6% to 7% zone. I mean, could that change? Of course. I mean, what would need to change? Probably the re-acceleration of fundamentals in the U.S., ultimately trickle through to the financing markets which open up to more development, which ends up allowing us to continue the strength that we're seeing overseas and the U.S. sort of turns around and picks up. That certainly could happen, Pat. We haven't seen it yet. If you look at what's going on in the lending community, it's been generally in the U.S. sort of tightening. I'd say it, throughout most of last year, there was a tightening. Now it's fairly stable. If the fundamentals stay strong for long enough, I suspect that will flip around. But there's a long gestation period associated with that. Which is why I said in earlier comments, I think the peak in the supply cycle in the U.S. is probably this year, when you look at it statistically. So, again, it's – not to be too long-winded, it sort of depends how long this re-acceleration lasts. It could naturally trickle through, but it will take some time. But we're pretty confident in the 6% to 7%, and we think those are good numbers.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yep.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Chris, just to follow-up on that last point. I think, you gave some color in the prepared remarks about Asia Pacific and China, in particular, being a part of your pipeline. Any more color you could sort of share with us a little bit on how your – specifically your franchising initiative with Hampton is going? Or how much of that pipeline is coming from, let's call it four and five star managed versus franchised over there, since it's such a big part of the growth that you're seeing?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we're – I mentioned, as you said, in some of the prepared comments that we've got a big chunk of our pipeline is in that market. 24%, I think, with a bulk of it under construction. It's a mix, but increasingly the mix is going towards the mid market. I've been pretty well chronicled in saying that that is a major trend there and pretty much every other part of the world, just as you have middle classes continuing to emerge around the world, that the mid market is what they can afford. And so you incrementally are seeing more demand growth in that segment. And obviously we want to be able to serve all customers, wherever they want to be, for whatever need they have. And that is increasingly one of the major areas where we can serve customers. So we went from, if you look at it five years ago, and I think fairly consistently with the industry. But I think we've been ahead of the curve, honestly, on the mid market in Asia Pacific, and particularly China. We were probably doing 90% upper upscale and above in China five years ago. If you look at it today, I would say it is probably 75%/25%, something like that. 75% meaning mid-scale versus upper upscale and above. I think that is absolutely reflective of what is going on in the market with demand. And China, like everywhere else, is reverting to the mean in that – in the sense of what's getting developed is what makes economic sense. Where if you go back five and ten years ago a lot of what was getting developed was, in effect, part of an infrastructure spend, where the economics didn't really support it. So, the good news is we're growing across the board. We've got great luxury stuff opening in China, tons of Hiltons, DoubleTrees, we've got Embassy coming. But when you wake up in five and ten years, Hampton particularly and Garden Inn, and ultimately other of our focused service brands will be where we have the massive sort of – where we've been able to create the network effect. We're well over 200 deals done with our master franchise relationship with Plateno. We're talking to them in lots of different ways about expanding that relationship. More to come on that. But I think it, given that Hampton with Plateno is the fastest growing of the international brands in pipeline in China, I think that alone sort of supports the success we're having. And if you went and saw the properties, which, of course, I've done, and I recommend doing, they're fantastic properties. They're doing a wonderful job in terms of what the product is, in terms of delivering service, and helping us build our network out in China. So, we have had great success. We have really – we're very optimistic about where things are going with Plateno and Jin Jiang.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: That's great. And I guess, just as a follow-up, maybe to stay with the same theme. I mean, in terms of those deals, are they – we do know that a lot of three-star hotel build out in China is conversion activity from other types of real estate. They tend to be these sort of structured lease deals. Is the stuff that you're doing, is it more purpose built? Is it kind of that four-star working its way down, right? But – or is it – are these conversions, things you're able to cycle through the pipeline more quickly?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's a mix. But I don't have the stats, to be honest. But if I had to guess at it, Shaun, I'd say it's at least 50%/50% adaptive reuse. I can – maybe I'll follow-up, we'll follow-up directly. But it's a big – a bunch of the ones I've seen and I know in the 200 plus deals we've done a significant percentage are adaptive reuse. Now, they're typically, there are a few cases where they were hotels that never really got off the ground and got gutted and turned into a Hampton. So effectively purpose built as a Hampton because we're not letting them not follow the standards. But the bulk of those have been like other uses, like office buildings and other things that literally got built and essentially never used, they were built and there was really no demand. And so they're changing their change of use. But the product, if you went and saw it, again I – which I have is terrific. I mean, these are – when they're adaptive reuse of existing hotels or an office building, they are gutted and built to our exact standards for Hampton. And they've done a really very, very good job with the product.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. So, in terms of the U.S. RevPAR growth and your outlook for it, how are you thinking about the variance between kind of the high end and low end properties, and then maybe different regions, I'm thinking more in terms of cities versus suburbs. I noticed that in the first quarter the STR data suggested you saw an acceleration in top 25 markets where it actually beat the rest of the country, when that was definitely the under-performer, historically. So how are you thinking about that? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Thomas. I mean, I'd say in terms of segment performance, top end luxury versus bottom end, our experience has not been that much different in the U.S. than overall. Although, as Chris pointed out, on a chain scale adjusted basis, we outperformed in the first quarter. So we took market share. And overall, most of the cities in the U.S., are starting to absorb – as I'm sure you know, are starting to absorb their supply and do a little bit better. In New York, you're absorbing supply. In San Francisco, you're coming through the Moscone Center renovations and things like that. And the hurricane-affected markets are obviously doing quite well. Florida is doing really well because they're not only getting some hurricane demand, but lapping over Zika and things like that. So, I'd say generally we're performing in the same overall way. What you see in terms of our under-performance in the first quarter versus the broader STR result is simply weighting. So I'd say nothing, no anomalies in terms of the way we're performing in the U.S. versus overall, other than we took some share in the first quarter.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks, Kevin. I guess my question was more on the outlook. I mean, are you thinking that – one thing that stood out to me in your prepared remarks was just inbound U.S. travel was up 9% in the quarter. I mean do you think that that's going to drive strength in U.S. cities versus suburbs? And how are you thinking about chain scales in the same way?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I'd say – sorry, the answer on the outlook, we don't have any reason to believe it'll be different than the first quarter. So, apologies for focusing on the first quarter. International inbound clearly is going to help. But keep in mind that it's 5% of our overall business. And in the cities, as you point out, is 20%. So it's clearly going to help New York, I think, international inbound revenue was up in the first quarter for the first time in two years. So, that's clearly helping the New York recovery and will with some of the other cities.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: The other thing, Thomas, that's helping in a bunch of suburban markets is oil and gas. So we're now finally starting to see everybody knows energy business has been picking up a lot of steam. Huge amounts of capital investments going in. Lots of energy, gas coming out. Oil and gas coming out of the ground and that's starting to flow through into the business. So we're now starting to see oil and gas markets are outperforming the broader markets. So, I think you have some good things going on in cities, with international. You have some good things going on in some of the suburban – outer suburban markets that are energy related. So fairly good news sort of across the board, I think.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yep.
Operator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. It looks like you reduced commissions on group bookings through third-party intermediaries. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the strategy around that a little more? Is that a relatively small piece of your overall group bookings? And does it signal that you're more confident in just, I guess, direct bookings through your own sales force?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's not an insignificant part of our overall group bookings. I think, Thomas (sic) [Smedes], as you might imagine, it's a delicate balance of trying to maintain – drive the business results, maintain great relationships with intermediaries that we want to have a good relationship with. But to serve our owner community well in terms of driving share and performance, but doing – driving it with distribution strategies that are cost-efficient. And so I think in part, yes, there's a confidence that we have in our ability to continue to drive group business. We obviously have great relationships with intermediaries. We want to continue to have a great relationship with them. But we also realize, representing our owner community that we need to continue – that you've seen huge increases in the percentage of group business that has an intermediary over the last decade. And that, in order to be responsible for the whole system, and to deliver profitability to owners, we need to drive efficiencies and this is a means to being able to continue to drive efficiencies and distribution costs.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just speaking – sticking with OTAs for – or commissions for a moment, I was just wondering, could you remind us when your next OTA contracts come up and what you're seeing in terms of overall bookings through the OTAs...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I don't think we actually disclose those things. But I will say, we are not in the middle of one, right now. We don't have any this year. So, assume maybe next year. I think, the strategy remains the same, which is we have a healthy relationship with the OTAs. When we negotiate our deals, sometimes they get a little dicey. But we have generally a healthy relationship, our focus with all the OTAs and there are a bunch of them that we work with, obviously, the two largest is about driving incremental business. And so, we've really tried to be intelligent in partnering with them and in structuring our deals with them to focus on the parts broadly. Every hotel, every region is different, but broadly focusing on distribution with them, where they can really add incrementality to the business in a reasonably cost-efficient way. And that is fairly typically with infrequent leisure travelers on weekends. Not always, but mostly. And so all of the structure of how we're doing things is to try and bifurcate the business into pieces. Obviously, try and drive the best distribution cost outcome that we can, again, to represent our owner community and the system. But there are plenty of opportunities where we can work with OTAs and other intermediaries where we can drive incremental profitable business, and that's what we want to do. We have had a huge effort, as you know, and you're only going to see more investment and activity in the area of building – continuing to build more direct relationships with our customers. You can see that we continue to push hard on making sure that our customers get the best value proposition by being members of Hilton Honors, and that means they get the best price. That means that all the other things they get as a consequence of being a member of Honors, in terms of the experience and the like, is driving a value proposition. And you'll continue to see us market very heavily to people so that they know those things that they are getting at a better value and a better experience by dealing directly with us. And ultimately, trying to drive as many people as we can in through our direct channels and, particularly, our app. And so, I've said many, many times, it's not that we don't want to have relationships with the OTAs, we do. We want those relationships focused in the areas of incrementality for us. And we want to have direct relationships everywhere else. And so, you will see from now until the cows come home that we're going to have an intense focus in both the value proposition and the marketing ends of building the direct relationships with customers.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay of RBC. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hi, everyone. Just going back to China, the RevPAR there has been quite strong for a while. I'm just curious, how much of it is due to building the brand, signing up more corporates and using less OTAs, and is there a lot of runway to do the up-mixing?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think, RevPAR performance in China has been good because China's economy is good. And both inbound business to China is strong. Travel within China is very strong. Chinese travelers make up the bulk of our business now in China, which is very different than a decade ago, and they want to see their country. They're traveling on business. Economic activity continues to be – GDP growth continues to be very strong in China. So, it feels good now. All indications, as we look at our business, suggest that it's going to stay strong. We clearly have a big new portfolio of hotels that are ramping up, and ramping up strong that is adding to it. But even if you take those hotels out, overall, RevPAR performance in China leads the world. So, things are very strong there. Our market share in China, as a result of the relationships we have across the board with intermediaries, but most importantly, with our direct relationship having built out a terrific sales force ahead of sort of the curve of our size in China, our index there, our market share is very strong. Frankly, if you look at the first quarter, our market share in the major regions of the world are equal to what we see in the U.S., which has never been the case. So, the brands are performing around the world really well. Our commercial teams are performing exceptionally well. And the network effect that we talk about that for so long we've had here in the U.S. that we've been building elsewhere will continue to build. But if you look at it on a simple metric of market share, we have very comparable market share now in all the major regions of the world, which is wonderful to see, and obviously indicative of the strength, but also indicative of what's to come in growth. Because, in the end, owners are investing in our system for a very simple reason, that's to make money. The higher our market share in all parts of the world, the more people are going to sign up to build us hotels. So, we're very excited to see the performance of the brands and commercial efforts in China, and around the world. They're going to help stimulate more NUG in the years to come.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then a quick follow-up on the 59% of occupancy coming from the Hilton Honors members. Is that a North America stat or is that a global stat?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Global stat.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Some peers have broadened their reach to other travel platforms or experiences. Maybe kind of two-part question for you. One, why hasn't Hilton gone that route yet? And then, two, how do you think about the hotel business, kind of high level, more evolving to top to bottom offerings for travelers today?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'm guessing that the real question is home sharing? Is that the way I should interpret that?
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: That's one of the components. Just kind of more of travel-related platforms, and just in the context of increased customer loyalty and the brands going after a greater share of everyone's wallet.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, good question, obviously, topical this week. You can imagine that we are always looking at options in terms of what we can offer our customers. That's why we've launched five new brands in as many years, and we've got four new brands that will come out over the next year or so. And we've looked at other areas in the travel space to judge whether we should do it. We obviously, in the home-sharing space, have spent a huge amount of time over the last few years, looking into the space, looking at it from a competitive point of view, looking at it from the standpoint of this is something we want to do. And at least at this point, obviously, if we had done something, you'd know it. We have decided not to do it. That's not to say that we wouldn't consider that in the future at some point. At the moment, we believe, as you've heard in my description of Airbnb in the past, at the moment, we believe it is enough of a different business that it is not something that we need to or should focus on. That delivering for our customers the core experience of a very high quality, consistent, differentiated product, with amenities associated with it, and with very high quality consistent service delivery, is what they come to us for. And that we believe, at least at the moment, the best way to deliver that is in the way that we're doing it. Where we have the controls in place, in terms of the product, amenities, service delivery, to be able to consistently give them something they want, and frankly, something that they will pay a premium for. That's why we have the highest average market share of anybody in the space. Again, I'm not saying that at some point, depending on how customers' demands change that we wouldn't do it. It's something we've thought about, considered, but at the moment, it is not something we're pursuing. And other things that are sort of outside the – obviously we're looking at other brands, other segments within the more traditional lodging space, other ideas. Again, we look at them, we try and be thoughtful about them. We're always considering options, but have not chosen to follow the path on any of those yet. And if we do, you guys will be the first to know.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Understood. Thanks for that.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'd just thank you, guys, for the time today. I know it was a busy day. Lots of people reporting. So we appreciate you spending a little time with us. Particularly given we had already pre-announced. But a few incremental tidbits of information hopefully you got out of this. Look forward to talking to you after the second quarter is done. Take care. Have a great day.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to Hilton’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release and on our website at ir.hilton.com. Unless otherwise noted, comparisons to the company’s fourth quarter and full year 2016 results assume that the spin-off transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide an update on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We’re happy to report fourth quarter results with top line and bottom line performance exceeding the high end of our guidance. As a result, our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS also beat expectations and we returned nearly $1.1 billion or more than 5% of our average market cap to shareholders. Specifically in the quarter, RevPAR grew 3.8% with all brand segments exceeding our expectations. U.S. RevPAR increased 3.2% largely driven by strong group and corporate transient business. Holiday shifts and weather impacts further help results. We expect this momentum, positive momentum to continue and are optimistic about the year ahead. Looking at macro indicators, forecast call for accelerating growth in GDP, nonresidential fixed investment and corporate profits, which all bode well for continued demand growth. Forward group booking trends also support continued optimism. For the full year 2018, group position is up in the mid-single digits with particular strength in company meetings and nearly 80% of group business is already on the books. Booking pace in the quarter for all future periods was up in the mid-teens, given increased demand and improved conversion. On the supply side, we think growth in 2018 will likely be at or below the long-term average. As a result, we’re maintaining our full year RevPAR guidance of 1% to 3%, but would expect results end up between the midpoint and the high end of the range. Additionally, we should continue to benefit from great traction on the development side of the business as we continue to outperform on share of global supply growth. For the full year, we expect to sign again more than 100,000 rooms and deliver net unit growth of approximately 6.5%. The strength of our brand portfolio and commercial engines are evident in our industry leading and growing RevPAR index premiums, which continue to help us drive strong unit growth. Meanwhile, the broad diversification of our pipeline helps mitigate the impacts of development cycles around the world. In 2017, we opened more than a hotel a day. We also reached record approvals of roughly 108,000 rooms and record construction starts, both of which exceeded expectations. In fact, we finished 2017 with the most rooms under construction in the industry, which account for 21% of rooms under construction globally. At year-end, our pipeline totaled nearly 2,300 hotels and 345,000 rooms, representing an increase of 8% in our U.S. pipeline and 15% internationally. We estimate our pipeline will generate nearly $700 million of stabilized annual adjusted EBITDA. Internationally, we’re actively pursuing additional growth opportunities by expanding into new markets and introducing new brands to existing markets. As a percentage of our total pipeline, the Asia Pacific region accounts for nearly 30%, EMEA accounts for roughly 20%, and Americas non-U.S. about 5%. In total, we have a strong international pipeline of 900 hotels and more than 180,000 rooms, including our recently signed 200th Hampton Hotel in China. For 2018, we estimate roughly 40% of our net unit growth will be located in international markets. Assuming the buildout of our entire pipeline, our international exposure increases from roughly 25% of rooms today to nearly 35%. We also a great development story in the U.S. led by conversion opportunities in our recently launched Tru brand. Curio, and our newest brand, Tapestry, which launched just last year, are particularly well positioned for conversion. Combined, these two brands have more than 50 hotels opened and 80 in the pipeline with each brand expected to double its presence within the next two years. Following the addition of several world-class Curios, including the Hotel del Coronado and The Statler Dallas, we look forward to converting other impressive properties in the coming year with anticipated openings in cities like Washington, D.C. and Paris and resort destinations in Japan and Costa Rica. We’re also benefiting from the fantastic traction with our Tru brand following the brand’s debut in Oklahoma City last April, we opened eight more properties in 2017, spanning the U.S. from Las Vegas, Nevada to Portland, Maine. We now have over 500 hotels opened and in various stages of development, including sign deals for three hotels in Canada with the first expected to open this year, marking an exciting milestone as the first international Tru by Hilton. In 2017, we added over 11 million members to our loyalty program for a total of over 71 million members at year-end, up nearly 20%, including a record number of enrollments in Asia Pacific, which doubled our membership in the region. To kick off 2018, we’re enhancing our Hilton Honors program to give our members even more value when they stay with us. Soon we’ll start rolling out new perks, especially for members of our highest tiers. These benefits include gifting elite status to another member, receiving bonus points for nights beyond a certain milestone, enrolling overnight to jumpstart earning status for the next year, all increasing the value and flexibility of our program. We’re also excited to share that our new portfolio of Hilton Honors American Express cobrand cards are available to our members and cardholders. The new card portfolio will give our customers and small businesses even greater choices and more benefits, making these the most rewarding Honors credit cards to date. We expect these cards to drive meaningful increases in loyalty and overall card spend not only benefiting customers, but also our total system. Moving on to technology. We now have digital key available in more than 350,000 hotel rooms and more than 2,500 hotels worldwide with hundreds more coming this year. In December, we officially debuted connected room, a first of its kind high-tech room that enables guests to personalize and control every aspect of their stay from the Hilton Honors app. Trends like digital globalization, automation are, of course, changing how all of us do business. With all of this change, we see tremendous opportunity for us to help redefine the future of hospitality. Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I want to touch briefly on the recent tax policy changes. Overall, we think this will be good for the broader economy, be good for the lodging industry and it will be good for Hilton and believe it will ultimately drive incremental demand and free cash flow. Consistent with our previously articulated capital allocation strategy, the bulk of our tax reform benefits will be returned to shareholders. To finish up, we’re really pleased with our performance in 2017 where we continue to lead in organic net unit growth, we delivered game-changing innovations and strong financial performance and generated significant returns for shareholders. I’d be remiss and not recognizing and thanking our 380,000 team members around the world who deliver the exceptional experiences that drive this continued success. With that, I’m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results and the outlook.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 3.8% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis, exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Our results were driven by better-than-expected group and corporate transient demand, and we estimate that holiday shifts and hurricane displacement also benefited system-wide RevPAR by roughly 100 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA of $498 million also exceeded the high end of our guidance range, increasing 10% year-over-year. Results benefited from better-than-expected performance across the board with solid RevPAR flow-through and greater corporate cost control. We estimate roughly $15 million of the beat versus the midpoint of guidance came from onetime items that we do not expect to repeat this year. In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 13% to $486 million, well ahead of our 8% to 10% guidance range. In addition to strong RevPAR, growth in license and application fees outpaced our expectations. Our owned and leased portfolio also posted better-than-expected performance, given increase transient business across Europe and healthy group demand in Japan. As a result, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items of $0.54 also beat expectations. Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Fourth quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 3.2%, meaningfully higher than our expectations given solid corporate transient group performance coupled with the benefits from holiday shifts and weather, which boosted U.S. RevPAR growth by an estimated 140 basis points in the quarter. For full year 2018, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth around the midpoint of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew a solid 2.2% versus the prior year due to strong leisure demand in Canada and hurricane-related business in Puerto Rico. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the high end of our guidance range. RevPAR growth in Europe grew 3.9% in the quarter driven by a rebounding demand in Turkey partially offset by softness in London. We expect full year 2018 RevPAR growth in Europe to be at to slightly above the high end of our range. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR growth was up 6.1%, in line with our expectations as continued strength in Egypt offset softer demand in Saudi Arabia given political instability and Visa restrictions. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.6% in the quarter, led by China where RevPAR grew 9% helped by ramping hotels. We expect the country to continue benefiting from occupancy upticks as both transient and group segments improved. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR for the Asia Pacific region to grow in the mid-single digits with RevPAR growth in China of 6% to 7%. Moving on to guidance. For full year 2018, we expect RevPAR growth of 1% to 3% and assume international markets will continue to outperform in the U.S. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.03 billion to $2.08 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 8% at the midpoint. We forecast diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $2.49 to $2.60. For the first quarter, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth of 1% to 3%, including a 100 basis point drag from the Easter calendar shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $410 million to $430 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items, of $0.43 to $0.47. Please note that our guidance ranges do not incorporate incremental share repurchases and include our adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards. The new standard will affect the way we recognize revenues. There will be changes to several line items across the P&L, but the most meaningful will be the deferral of upfront fees. Going forward, we will recognize upfront fees over the life of the contract instead of at the time we execute the contract. Importantly, the accounting changes do not affect cash flow or cash available for capital return, but we estimate that it would lower 2017 reported adjusted EBITDA by $55 million to $60 million and expect a similar reduction to our 2018 adjusted EBITDA. Moving on to capital return. We paid a cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the fourth quarter for a total of $195 million in dividends and $1.1 billion in total capital return during 2017. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the first quarter. For 2018, inclusive of cash tax savings of $125 million to $150 million, we expect to return between $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion to shareholders or roughly 5% to 6% of our market cap in the form of buybacks and dividends. We expect quarterly dividends to remain at the same level as 2017. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please.
Operator: Certainly Mr. Jacobs. [Operator Instructions] Your first question this morning will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys, thanks and good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Carlo Santarelli: I have a two part question, both aspects of it I would say are related to tax reform to an extent. But if you guys could comment on kind of post tax reform, what you’ve seen with respect to the business transient corporate negotiated rate discussions as well as any impact on your discussions with developers for the implications that would have for them on future developments.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, Carlo, I’ll take that. And Kevin, you can jump in whatever you might want to add. I’d say, obviously, got done at the very end of last year, so it’s still reasonably early to begin to judge it. But I’d say sort of anecdotally, having talked to a bunch of our customers and been at a bunch of different events where we host large numbers of them, it’s viewed as very positive. Most of the – if I think about where we are this year and the conversations I was having versus where we were last year, I would say it is a very, very different tone, much more positive. I think that’s being driven – to your question by tax reform, I think it’s also being driven certainly in the U.S. by the regulatory environment being easier on companies. So I’d say broadly as it relates to business transient, I would say there’s reasons to be optimistic. We started to see that show up in numbers at the end of last year. I think we’ve seen that continue into this year. I would say it’s still early days in the sense that it’s not consistently better. It’s been a bit choppy, but my expectation is if forecasts are right that this is going to help move GDP growth up a little bit. And given the optimism that I’m sensing from a lot of our big customers and broadly across a bunch of different industries, that it’s going to help drive better corporate transient growth than we had last year, which as you will recall looking at the numbers, was very anemic. So I think tax reform – I think everything going on right now globally in terms of global growth, picking up a little bit of steam and certainly in U.S. with the expectations of growth picking up as a result of tax reform and regulatory change are going to be good. In terms of our development community, I think, again, it’s early days. I’d say it’s hard to find somebody that’s not – that is in business that’s not more optimistic right now than they might have been a year ago or even, for that matter, six months ago. And given that our development community are eternal optimist, they were reasonably optimistic before, they’re even more optimistic now. So I’d say that all bodes well for what’s going on, on the development side. Having said that, what’s going on in the lending environment is I’d say that’s stable. You had a lot of tightening going on in the development environment throughout last year. If you look at the fourth quarter, that started to really stabilize. Whether more financing availability comes to the market as a consequence of a rebound in the economy, I think time will tell. We haven’t seen that yet, but time will tell. But I’d say broadly, the business community, including our development community, are more optimistic because I think, they think the changes that have been going on over the last few quarters are going to ultimately drive broader growth in the economy – growth will pickup in the economy and it’s going to translate into more demand growth for hotel rooms, which I think stands to reason.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, thank you. That’s very helpful. And Kevin, just a clarification. You said the cash tax impact $125 million to $150 million, correct?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. That’s right, Carlo.
Carlo Santarelli: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi, good morning. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi. So Chris, following tax reform, a pickup in corporate transient travel, which you’ve talked about, possibly supported by your prepared remarks, there’s been optimism by some in the investment community that U.S. RevPAR growth could exceed 3% this year, again, – for the industry. You’re guiding to about 2% for Hilton. So just maybe wondering, first, if you agree with this bullish view. So if you had to put out like a bull case on U.S. RevPAR growth for the industry for 2018, what would it be and why? And maybe you could just talk a little bit about the implied U.S. RevPAR guidance that’s out there now.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, great question. I think it’s the good question. First of all, I think technically, Felicia, if you go back and listen to my comments we really guided to 2.5%, in the sense that we’re not moving the 1% to 3%, but I said the likely outcome would be from the mid to the high, so I would sort of view that as 2.5%. And that is consistent, pretty much identical to what we delivered in 2017. And so if you take the bull case and remember, everybody that knows me knows I’m an optimist by nature, but I think there are reasons to be optimistic right now. I think if you take the bull case, it would sort of be the following: you delivered 2.5% last year in an environment where group was sort of relatively weak. Leisure transient, relatively strong. Business transient, sort of relatively weak. And you had a big – a bunch of help from the international markets, which were very strong, that delivered 2.5%. You fast forward to 2018, I think international markets, by the way, is sort of, take that off the table, are going to be strong again. Our estimation is there – between Europe and APAC, well, they will be both better than what we think the U.S. will deliver. They won’t be quite as robust. They’re still going to be really good. Won’t be quite as robust as last year, so maybe that creates a teeny bit of drag. But then more – I think potentially more than offsetting that for the bull case would be leisure transient looks to be sort of good again, right? You have consumer confidence, if anything, picking up, not declining. So you would argue that that’s a good leading indicator of what’s going to happen with leisure transient. We talked about business transient. While it’s early and it’s a bit choppy, if the economy really is doing what we think and most people think it is doing, that will lead to, I think, a little bit better result in business transient than we got last year. And group, if it plays out as sort of set up for the year where we’re at a mid-single- digit system-wide position with pretty good momentum, it should be better than what was a relatively weak year in group last year. You aggregate that altogether and I think you could certainly conclude that we should do better than last year, which was 2.5%. And so that would be the bull case. And you would say, legitimately, so why aren’t you giving us the bull case in your outlook? And the reason that we’re not is real simple. It’s February. There’s a lot of year to play out and we want to sort of see these things. We want to make sure we’re very optimistic, confident about group, but we want to see it play out. I mean as we said, 80% of it’s on the books, but we want to see it play out. And importantly, we want to continue to see firming up on the business transient side. If those things happen throughout the year, I think you’ll see us sort of adjustment our expectations. But given it’s our first call, it’s early in the year. We thought being sort of down the middle at this point was the right place to be.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning everybody. Chris, you started off the call by talking about particular strength in company group meetings or corporate group meetings. Can you talk about how much of a leading or maybe coincident indicator that is for individual corporate transient travel, at least in the past?
Chris Nassetta: In the past, Joe, I would say that the group is typically a lagging indicator. And so it is a little bit of an anomaly that you’re seeing it pickup. Well, I would say that’s the way it usually works. We did see a pickup, at the same time we saw our corporate group pickup. We saw corporate transient pickup. And so in that way, they’re happening at the same time. But I’d say corporate group is a bit ahead of it and more – the pickup is more stable. Corporate transient pickup has been a little choppier. But nonetheless, I think the trend line is headed in a good direction. And I can’t honestly – now look, again, I can’t explain why it’s a little bit different this time other than the fact that I think in corporate, I still think in corporate group, the industry is running at such high occupancy levels overall that people – the corporate procurement offices are figuring out if they don’t get ahead of it a little bit, they’re not going to be able to have their meetings, where on the transient side, I think there’s still a belief that it can be a little bit more last minute. I think that’s probably the – what’s driving what I would say is not a major anomaly, but a little bit of an anomaly where they’re either a coincident or they flipped around a little bit in terms of what’s leading and what’s lagging.
Joe Greff: Helpful. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yup.
Operator: The next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry Curtis: Good morning. 
Chris Nassetta: Good morning Harry.
Harry Curtis: Good morning. if you could touch on what your leverage ratio ended the year at, your net debt leverage ratio and the math that you were using to get to the $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion and basically ending up at kind of the middle of the 3x to 3.5x leverage ratio target? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Harry. We ended the year at about 3.1, the very low 3s. And our $1.2 billion to $1.6 total capital return assumes, call it 3 to 3.25x leverage in that range.
Harry Curtis: Okay. So that was such a short question and answer. I think I get part b.
Chris Nassetta: Breaking the rule, Harry.
Harry Curtis: I know, I’m sorry. Can you just talk about the impact of higher interest rates or the potential impact on higher rates on your construction or development pipeline? And whether or not it’s been locked in for the next couple of years?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. It’s a good question, Harry. You sort of partially answered it yourself. I mean, the next couple of years is – the way this construction cycle plays out, the next couple of years is pretty well locked in. And then in terms of longer term than that, if rates continue to go up, that’s probably going to mean the economy is getting better. And as Chris said, our developers are an optimistic bunch. And so even though the capital might get a little bit expensive, what their underwriting gets looks a little bit better on paper. So probably definitely not a big short-term impact and probably doesn’t really have that big of a long-term impact either.
Harry Curtis: Perfect. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling: You mentioned the addition of 11 million members to total, I think it was $71 million at year-end for the loyalty program. Can you talk to how engagement within your loyalty base is potentially changing? And maybe provide an update on your direct booking efforts and how that may be growing and changing consumer behavior? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I’d say engagement is up pretty materially. I don’t have the percentage sitting in front of me. But clearly, we have the percentage of active members is up pretty materially year-over-year. And not surprising, related to the second part of your question, we’ve been working very hard on to strategies that have more direct relationships with customers, which I know sometimes can get interpreted as like a marketing campaign like Stop Clicking Around or whatever. But it has – obviously, it is a much more complex and holistic approach, which has to do with making sure what we’re doing with product, what we’re doing with service, importantly, what we’re doing with technology, what we’re doing with very specific parts of the Honors program to drive more – not only deeper engagement, but more frequent engagement with customers is all, I would say, working in getting more people in the program, higher percentage of them engaged and more of them booking directly with us. We know that once they come into the program, the vast majority, 90-plus – I think it’s 95%, close to 95% of customers, when they become an Honors member, start booking directly through us, which is obviously a much more efficient channel. And so I think we’re having really good success. But as I’ve said on lots of prior calls, this is going to be something we’ll be talking about forever and instead, it’s a very comprehensive approach to having deeper, more frequent engagement with customers.
Stephen Grambling: Maybe as a quick follow-up. What percentage of bookings are going through your mobile app at this point?
Chris Nassetta: It’s about 10% and growing.
Stephen Grambling: All right. I’ll jump back in a queue.
Chris Nassetta: 10%, and that’s about third – close to a third or either Web Direct or mobile. So make sure we add that, you’ve got to add the web in that.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hi, good morning everyone. Chris, I think you alluded to this a little bit in your answer to Harry’s question, but just kind of – just going back to the supply growth side. One change that we’re noticing as we move through 2017 is that supply growth for the industry overall is starting to peak out. And so my question is just how long do you guys think you can maintain sort of where you’re at on that very significant 6.5% kind of net unit growth? And is there, maybe over the next two to three years or we’re going to see some shift where you’re going to move from a little bit of the majority of that or the slight majority of that coming from domestic that’s going to shift to international? What are some of the puts and takes as we get out in 2019, 2020 to maintain the growth rates that you’re seeing?
Chris Nassetta: I mean, clearly, to your comment or question, Shaun, the U.S. is sort of past its peak. Now we’ve extended it, the peak in the U.S. because of the success we’re having with conversions in particularly Tru. But I think either in 2016 or 2017, that’s where you saw the peak in deal signings in the U.S. for the industry. Having said that, for us, we extended it. And in terms of delivering 6% to 7% NUG over the next few years, I would say I feel really good about it. I mean, not only is it a big world where we have lots of opportunities around the world. And clearly, as the has U.S. slowed down a bit, you’ve seen the international side pickup. We were in the low 30s in terms of representation and international in NUG in 2017, we’re going to be probably in the low 40s, 40 or low 40s in 2018, I would tell you that trend line will continue both because of not just what’s going on in the U.S. but the success we’re having in the opportunities we have offshore are only growing. So it’s a big world. It doesn’t all move in lockstep. And I think if we do our job, which I think we’ve proven we’ve been able to do for a decade and being thoughtful about how we layer existing brands in various markets, add new brands to some of our existing markets like Tru that we’re going to be able to keep that growth growing. Now here’s the other thing over – when you look four, five, six years, a lot of things can happen in the world. I mean, if we do our job, we’re going to keep growing at a better pace. As you look at the next two or three, I’m not going to say nothing fully in the bag, but half of our pipeline is under construction, okay? So that’s 160,000, 170,000 rooms are under construction right now. If you add up what we’re going to deliver over the next two or three years, right, those numbers aren’t that far off. And you add a spattering of 20% to 30% conversions into that number, which we think we have consistently delivered at that level or above. And I think I would say to you, we feel confident that what we laid out at our Analyst Day over a year ago of being in that six to seven range over the next few years is readily achievable. And I would argue sort of a lot of it is already in gestation.
Shaun Kelley: Great. Maybe just one clarification, Chris. The 20% to 30% conversion, is that the annual rate? So they’re kind of the annual number that you’re – of the deliveries that you’re receiving? Or is it that much actually coming out of conversion rate?
Chris Nassetta: If you average it, every year is a little different. Just things cycle through depending on deals and things we’re working on. But if you look at it over the last five or six years, it’s averaged in that range. My guess is – so yes, I’m confident we’ll continue to deliver in that range, particularly with having newer brands, Curio being newer, Tapestry being very new. We’re – we’ve talked a bunch about what we’re thinking about doing in the development of our third soft brand, which is in the luxury space. That’s not too far off, so that will be another conversion brand opportunity. And then Doubletree continues to be a fantastic brand for conversion opportunities and we’ve had great success there. So I think we can definitely deliver in that 20% to 30% range. You add that to what is already under construction around the world. And again, it takes a lot. I don’t want to minimize the hard work as our team listens to these calls and they’re thinking, we got three years of really hard work, boss, to do all this stuff, and they do. But the reality is we’ve got good momentum. And if we do our jobs, we can deliver that growth.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Hey, good morning. It’s been about, I think, it’s around six months since you announce in your credit card agreements. What has kind of been the biggest surprises to date? And how are you thinking about it going forward? Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Thomas. I don’t think – it’s funny, I don’t think there have been too many surprises today in terms of – we’ve laid out what we thought the incremental economics were going to be. And so far, those have been, frankly, maybe even a little bit better, but generally inconsistent with what we’ve seen. The new cards just launched, and so it’s early days. And in terms of economic outcomes, it’s probably too early to opine. But so far, consumers are receiving the cards really well and we’re getting great feedback. So we’re excited about the program, but so far, I wouldn’t say there have been any surprises.
Thomas Allen: Okay. And if I could ask a quick clarification question. What was the group RevPAR in 2017? You’re talking about kind of mid-single-digit for 2018?
Chris Nassetta: In 2017, it was up 1.6%. System-wide it was just was up 1.6%, right now system-wide positions mid-single digits, five and change.
Thomas Allen: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you. Maybe I’ll pretend my two questions are also just one question.
Chris Nassetta: People are doing really good at this.
Robin Farley: First, just on your fee growth guidance of 8% to 10%. It seems like you can get there just from the unit growth you’ve talked about and from your RevPAR guidance. So wouldn’t – can it potentially be a higher growth rate given your non-RevPAR fees in there as well? And then my other question is on a different topic is, just if you’ve had any conversations or just have any thoughts about one of your large shareholders that has been talked about maybe revisiting some of their investments and whether you have any color from them or thoughts on what they might do with their stake.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Thanks Robin. I’ll take your two questions one at a time. The fee – as to the fee growth guidance, I think what you’re alluding to is our algorithm of RevPAR plus NUG if you think about what Chris has said about RevPAR at 2.5% and NUG at 6.5%. That gets you to 9%, which is the midpoint of our fee guidance. As we’ve talked about, license fees are growing ahead of that algorithm rate, but you also have some of the fees in there, the non-RevPAR driven fees like change of ownership and app fees that are growing a little bit below the algorithm rate. So that’s sort of – 8% to 10% is a wide range and that sort of plays out. The other thing that’s going on is we had a good year this year in IMF with growth of about 10% in incentive fees, and so we’re creating a little bit, and some of that was due to some onetime and timing items. And so we’ve created a little bit of a headwind there in IMF. And even though that’s only 10% of the fee segment, but it’s sort of all averaging up to about 9%. And of course, we ended up higher this year than our guidance range and we’d like to think we can get to the high end of the range or better this year. But given it’s early in the year, we felt like 8% to 10% was the right guidance. And then on the next one, I assume you’re alluding to HNA who’s been in the press with your second question. And I’d say like we don’t comment on the dealings of any of our individual shareholders, we’re not going to comment on what HNA might or might not do with their shares and what might or might not be going on with their company. As you know, we have a shareholder agreement with them that contains protections for shareholders, and that’s probably all I will say for now.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Great. Good morning. Chris, you’ve talked about some of the gives and takes and fundamentals 2017 versus 2018. You didn’t touch at all on inbound international travel and I think the U.S. lost significant market share last year. Dollar has come down. I’m wondering if you’re seeing any rebound in inbound travel or you feel like you’re making any headway in D.C. and kind of changing the message and maybe some of the barriers to inbound travel?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I didn’t. That’s a good question, Bill. I didn’t mean to exclude it. It isn’t a huge part of our business system-wide. It’s circa 5% of the business. So I don’t tend to think of it as a segment unto itself, I kind of break it down into three mega segments. But it’s a good question. International inbound revenues were down for us circa – and I think the industry maybe have been a little bit worst, circa 4% last year. I think our expectation for this year is while it’ll be on a little bit of lag with what’s going on with the dollar, that isn’t an immediate impact as people have planning time for travel. But our expectation is and certainly what the early signs that we’re seeing and talking to our teams around the world is that it’s going to be better this year than last meeting we don’t think – we think it will be flat to modestly up is sort of what our worst case is. I think that has to do with the dollar, and I hope it has to do with some of the work that we’re doing as an industry to work with the administration to sort of soften the edges of some of what’s being said, not in any way to diminish the profile of security being sort of a top priority, but to make sure that we soften the rhetoric, so that those that are interested in coming to United States, the vast majority want to do no harm to United States feel a bit more welcome. And so we’ve been having – the industry through our trade associations and a bunch of us individually have been having lots of conversations. And yes, I’d like to think we’re making some progress there. We’ll keep working on that. And the dollar, I think, will help us and give us a little bit of a tailwind as well.
Bill Crow: Thanks. Chris, if I could just ask, I think I missed the answer to this. But the Tru brand, how many do you actually expect to open in 2018?
Chris Nassetta: I think we can open about 40 to 50 this year. And then based on what’s happening, that should be double that in 2019. We would – we’re hoping to get, let’s say, 50 this year open and 100 next year.
Bill Crow: That’s it for me. Thank you for your help.
Chris Nassetta: Great Bill, thanks.
Operator: The Next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: I’ll try and squeak in maybe a two-parter here as well. Just first one, Chris…
Chris Nassetta: We got new system.
Jeff Donnelly: Chris, you mentioned in your remarks just some of the, I guess, benefits that you’re giving to some of your best loyalty members, it’s just that it feels like we’re at a point where net room demand is beginning to improve and frankly, the competitive field is becoming more like an oligopoly. So I guess, first question is why increase loyalty concessions at this point? And second question, a different topic, I guess, relates to consolidation. I’m just curious how do you respond to investor views that you could use your premium evaluation to acquire another platform and maybe make Hilton an even more lucrative enterprise to use that greater scale to access revenue and expense synergies that maybe you can’t access today even though you are already a very significant platform?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. We do. I’ll take them as you gave them. In terms of loyalty, I don’t view what we’re doing in loyalty as in any way as sort of a space race. Like, I mean, we’re not out there looking at what everybody else is doing and saying, if they do this, we got to one up it and do that. I mean, obviously, our teams are cognizant of what’s going on in the competitive marketplace. That’s not at all what’s driving it. What’s driving it is talking to our customers and figuring out what I said earlier, how do we get them to have – how do we create a deeper connection with them and get them more frequently engaged with us so that in the end, they’re more loyal to us and they buy more of our products. And so the response that you’re seeing in some of these things that I highlighted, which are not big money items, are things that our customers are saying would make a difference. They don’t cost our system much, but it would create greater engagement, greater loyalty, more frequent engagement, which we think ultimately will drive share. So everything we’re doing is not about space race, spend more money. Many of these things that we’re doing don’ t cost much of anything. I mean, giving them more utility on points and things. There’s a theoretical cost to some of these, but a whole bunch of them are not particularly costly. It’s not like owners are bearing the burden of cost – incremental cost. It doesn’t work that way. They’re paying it and we’re – we may allocate the cost in a different way. And part of this has also been about taking other things away. So we had – I’ll give you a great example that we’ve had historically where you earn points and miles, right? And we were one of the few that did of the few that did it. There’s a long history to it long before my time. Super expensive program. Well, we’ve sort of weaned our customers off of that and then reallocated that into a whole bunch of other things that we think will drive more engagement with our customers. So it’s not just sort of add – an incremental add. It is always about what do we need to do to get people more engage, wanting to come directly to us because that will drive more loyalty, more share and more profitable share in the sense of lowering distribution costs. On consolidation, yes, I mean, I probably answered this maybe thousand or maybe more times. Here’s the thing, I think from our point of view, you’re right. We do have a good platform. I think if you look at the numbers that we just reported for last year on growth and across the board, I would say we’re pretty proud of those results. If you look at what we’re giving you and expectations for this year on unit growth and the next few years as I described in my earlier comments, we feel really good about that. So yes, we have been very focused on an organic growth strategy because ultimately, we think it helps us deliver better products that resonate more with customers and delivers better returns for you guys. And so that has been the approach, and we think that it’s working. And now if we didn’t have scale or if we were missing segments and we had big strategic gaps, I would understand the argument. But we don’t, meaning we have plenty of scale. We have great representation across the globe in the most important geographies. And we have all of the major segments covered. So we don’t have strategic gaps. We have the ability to grow both our existing brands, add new brands and do it in organic way where it’s effectively an infinite yield because there’s really no cost or meaningful cost associated with that growth. So the math is pretty easy and that’s why the focus and I think the numbers speak for themselves in terms of success. Now having said that, I’ve said this a thousand times, too. We would never say never. That is a dumb thing for any CEO to say. We’ve looked at tons of things over the years, you guys know that, pretty much everything has been out there. When we were private, when we were – since we’ve been public, we looked at it. We have a team that works with us to analyze these things. To date, we have not found things that really met the standard, which is that it’s something that is very strategically important and a good fit strategically and economically advances the ball in terms of creating material value for shareholders. And so – but having said it doesn’t mean that we would never find something that would meet that criteria. We just haven’t to date, and we – so we’ve been very focused on organic growth and I think we’ll continue to do so and continue to deliver what I think are great results with that focus. And if something ever presents itself that meets the test, then we’d consider.
Jeff Donnelly: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Good morning. Just a question on your G&A guidance. And I want to, guess, ask if I’m looking at this apples-to-apples. It calls for a deceleration in cost in 2018 versus 2017. Is that looking at it apples-to-apples? And secondly, what may be driving that?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Patrick. You are looking at it apples-to-apples. Our guidance does call for G&A to go down and it’s pretty simple. It’s the transaction expenses for the most part that we incurred last year in doing the spend.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. If I may ask a quick second question here, regarding…
Chris Nassetta: It’s hard to stop the second question. So, I guess, we got a problem.
Patrick Scholes: Blame Harry Curtis here for that one. Thanks. On your corporate rate negotiations, I had heard there had been some pushback on the sort of the extended cancellation policies. How did that end up for you as far as rate negotiations?
Chris Nassetta: It ended up in the low twos, which is consistent with what we expected. And remember, that was all done pretax reform and sort of before the economy started to get a little bit of this incremental momentum. So that’s what we thought. That’s where it ended up. We did have a little kickback on that, but not material. I mean, I talked to a lot of customers. I’ll put this, not one of them raised it with me. I mean, I know when I talked to our sales teams, they said that it came up, a few people groused about it. But when you explain why we were doing it, I think people understood it and dealt with it.
Patrick Scholes: Okay, thank you. That’s it.
Operator: The next question will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask you, you talked about around a 2% RevPAR growth for the U.S. this year. And how do you think that – how do you think about your owner’s margins in that environment, given there are a lot of cost coming through the system? And does that have any impact on your kind of incentive fees? And they’re most maybe are driven by U.S. results but any kind of thoughts around that.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Smedes. I mean, you’re right. You sort of touched on a dynamic that has been existing frankly for both our owners in the U.S. and for us and our ownership portfolio, which is at those levels of RevPAR growth given the way the cost base is growing, it gets difficult to grow margins and so margins have been pretty stable. I mean, overall, owned and operated margins for us actually for 2017 were up, but most of that was driven by results outside the U.S. And for us, in terms of IMF is it shouldn’t be a meaningful impact. I mean, you’ve recognized and frankly, most of our IMF comes from outside the U.S. and over 85% or 90% of those, of the IMF does not stand behind owner’s priority return and participates at the house profit level, which, of course, that is – margins effect house profit as well, but it’s just not – it’s not a meaningful driver of IMF for us.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And just too often made a mockery of your one-question policy. I did want to ask your Blackstone has been – linked in the media it’s a potential buyer of the Waldorf, I mean, just curious since that’s such a flagship property for you, would you look to get involved with whomever would potentially buy that asset? Could you make any kind of economic investment? How do you think about the timing and sort of the scope of that project, which seems to have sort of not really moved from the time that Anbang initially purchased it?
Chris Nassetta: Well, that’s a complicated one, but I’ll take it on. The – first of all, there is activity going on at the Waldorf. If you were to walk in that building, you would see that heavy demolition is going on and on. Anbang has been moving forward. We’ve had…
Smedes Rose: So is it on schedule with what you had initially thought though or it seems like…
Chris Nassetta: Generally, yes. The planning of it is all done and they’re in heavy demolition. And as far as what they’re telling us, they intend to move forward with that. They are – it is rumored out there that they’re going to sell a bunch of stuff. My understanding is that it’s accurate, I do not, at least at this moment when things can change, believe that that does include the Waldorf Astoria. At least as they have said it to us. I can’t comment on what Blackstone is doing. They’re – we’re not affiliated with them. If you have a question for what they’re going to do, you can ask them. But my understanding from Anbang, notwithstanding them trying to sell a bunch of different assets around the world. At the moment, the Waldorf is not one of those and they tell us that they’re moving forward and, in fact, as I’ve said, work is going on. We are in a very well protected position there for the record in the sense of the agreements that we have with whoever, if it’s Anbang, that’ll be with them. If it ends up with somebody else, we have very strong agreements that will run with the property.
Smedes Rose: Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael Bellisario: Good morning, everyone. Chris, just want to go back to kind of size and scale topic and maybe how you think about balancing that net unit growth, which obviously is a big driver for you and investors are focused on. But also being cognizant of existing owners, kind of their profitability and not diluting them with new supply in today’s tough operating environment, kind of how you think about that balancing act?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, it’s one that we take awfully seriously as you might imagine, given that particularly in a capital-light world, but no real estate timeshare, pretty much 100% of our growth is coming from the ownership community around the world. So we work – I’m not going to say we’re perfect, okay? Nobody is, but we work really hard and are really thoughtful about each individual project in whatever market it is in and making sure that we don’t think it’s going to create any sort of meaningful lasting impact to an existing owner. And we have a whole process that we work with owners on where we are adding product in markets where they are there. Thankfully in many of those markets, we have owners that are very present in that market. And if we’re doing incremental work, it’s with them. And so they’re adding to their own inventory in that market. But where it is in conflict in different owners, we do a whole bunch of work to really analyze and understand theoretical impact. And if we think that it’s not going to be good for them and it’s going to have a lasting detrimental impact, then we walk away from deals and we do it all the time. I mean, we have debates around this very table I’m sitting at with our development teams, we do a whole bunch of analysis and we do walk away from deals on a regular basis.
Michael Bellisario: That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
Vince Ciepiel: Great, thanks. So last year, domestic RevPAR benefited from inauguration, hurricane and a couple other big events. I think on prior calls, you maybe had mentioned that you didn’t see as much lift as maybe the industry as a whole from those one-time events due to exposures. So I guess, my question is in your 1.5% last year, can you take a stab at maybe quantifying those tailwinds? And then as you move into 2018, I mean, do you think that you’ll have a lingering benefit from the hurricane? And then, I guess, early in January based on what you saw, how was lapping the inauguration?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Vince, I’ll take this. It’s Kevin. I mean, last year in the U.S., I think I mentioned in my prepared remarks that there was 140 basis points in the quarter related to events. I think for the overall year, it was 100 basis points or maybe even a little bit less of a tailwind. Early in the inauguration over January last year will certainly affect D.C., but on a macro basis, it’s not going to have that big of an impact overall. And that’s all baked into our guidance. And so we do have – we did mention that some of our brands are not able to drive occupancy as much when these events go on because they’re already full, right? So that has an effect of causing us to underperform on a RevPAR growth basis a little bit versus the industry versus STR. So that’s all baked into our guidance for this year.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, everybody, for the time today. Look forward to catching up with you after the first quarter to give you an update on how we think about the rest of the year. Take care.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. At this time, you may disconnect your lines.

This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company’s outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we’ll be happy to take your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. Before I get to the specifics on the quarter, I’d like to briefly recognize all of those around the world who have been impacted by recent natural disasters it’s something that was brought into vivid reality as I recently visited our teams down in Puerto Rico and in Houston. It’s been an incredibly challenging time for these communities and for our team members that serve them. At the same time it’s been really inspiring to see our teams come together to support one another and their communities, and I want to thank them for all of their extraordinary efforts. Now turning to the quarter in our performance, the third quarter as the new simplified Hilton in our strong performance continued. We delivered bottom line results above our guided ranges and are raising our outlook for the year our performance continues to demonstrate the resiliency of our fee based business that can drive adjusted EBITDA well ahead of RevPAR growth with minimal use of our capital and generate meaningful free cash flow for shareholders. The fundamentals we discussed last quarter are largely unchanged. Excluding the impact of holiday they shifts and whether overall RevPAR trends had been generally in line with our expectations this quarter and consistent with what we’ve seen all year. We continue to see steady business transient and group growth at the low-to-mid point of our guidance range and leisure transient at the high end. Group pace in the quarter was up improving position for the balance of the year. Strength in international markets particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific continues to boost system-wide results. Assuming a similar cadence for the remainder of the year we expect system-wide RevPAR to come in at or slightly above the midpoint of our 1% to 3% guidance range. So far in October, which contributes approximately 40% of the quarter system-wide RevPAR is slightly ahead of expectations. As we look to 2018, we feel good about the set up and even better about our ability to continue delivering value beyond what broader fundamentals give us. Economic indicators point to a macro environment slightly better than this year with growth in U.S. GDP and nonresidential fixed investment forecasted to increase year-over-year. In the roughly 30% of our business where we have decent sightlines, we see 2018 group position ahead of this year and we expect corporate negotiated rate increases of between 2% and 3%. Supply remains modest and with U.S. supply growth forecasted at around it’s 30 year average. Given that set up we should have a similar level of pricing power next year leading to 2018 system-wide RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%. Turning to the development side. Year-to-date we’ve opened nearly 300 hotels with roughly 40,000 rooms and we remain on track to deliver net unit of approximately 6.5% for the full year. With over half our pipeline already under construction, we have very good visibility into our unit growth, and as a result, would expect net unit growth of around 6.5% again next year. We are committed to thoughtful and intentional organic growth that allows us to strategically expand our global footprint. We believe this approach will continue to enhance our network effect and ultimately grow our share of global development. This is evident in our growing pipeline, which reached a record 335,000 rooms in the quarter, up roughly 13% year-over-year and representing a market leading 40% of our existing supply. With year-to-date pace ahead of expectations, we now forecast full year 2017 approvals to exceed our record of 106,000 rooms that was achieved last year. In the U.S. we continue to gain traction with conversions. We recently welcomed the London and New York City to our portfolio. We will oversee a full renovation of this property. After which, the property will be reflagged as the Conrad New York Midtown. This prestigious 562 key hotel become the Conrad brand second property in New York City and will set a new standard of smart luxury with a spacious all-suite product. Speaking of London, I’m pleased to announce today that we are announcing the Waldorf Astoria brand is set to make its London debut in one of the capital’s best known monuments. The Admiralty Arch Waldorf Astoria will be one of London’s most prestigious addresses, literally at the entrance to the mall and facing Buckingham Palace. Following an extensive refurbishment program, which will restore and protect this iconic landmark, the hotel plans to open with 96 luxurious hotel rooms and suites and three world class restaurants. The Asia-Pacific region represents our largest growth opportunity with roughly 400 hotels totaling over 90,000 rooms, the region accounts for a quarter of our pipeline and we’re opening more than one hotel per week there. In the third quarter, we opened the Waldorf Astoria Chengdu in China, our 200th hotel in the region and the latest in a fast growing luxury portfolio. We also celebrated the arrival of our first Curio in China, our ninth brand in the country. Located on Hainan island, the 266 room resort demonstrates our ability to attract unique asset to our soft brands given the favorable value proposition that our system offers. Over all our global growth is driving increased loyalty from our guests, increasing our overall market share, and delivering strong returns for owners. A couple of weeks ago, we hosted nearly 3000 attendees at our global owners’ conference in Dallas at the Hilton Manetobe. The theme of the conference was the power of our network effect. This is created by bringing our industry leading brands with global scale and change scale diversity together with a highly relevant loyalty program and the best commercial engines in the business to deliver increasing customer preference and ultimately leading returns for our owners. Innovation is a critical driver of our network effect, and our app is the key platform for that innovation. In addition to being our fastest growing and lowest cost distribution channel our app also enables the deep integration of the on-property experience into the mobile devices of our guests allowing a direct differentiated customer experience. Our app currently enables digital check in with room selection globally, as well as digital key for Hilton Honors members. Our most recent enhancements and enable members to upgrade a check-in much like airlines upsell preferred seats. Through a recently launched live chat function members can also engage on property team members directly for any requests they may have. Coming soon is connected room, the first truly mobile-centric hotel room through the app members will be able to seamlessly control their rooms lighting, HVAC and entertainment options including preloaded and streaming content. Owners who also benefit from room and energy use that will support environmental and operational improvements. We’re in beta testing in select hotels now and expect to formally launch connected room next year. In summary, we’re pleased with our performance this quarter and feel really good about the set up as we head into 2018, in which modest RevPAR growth can drive meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth and capital returns for shareholders. Our teams around the world and our purpose-led culture they bring to life each and every day are critical to this ongoing success. I’m pleased to announce that just this morning, we were once again selected as one of the world’s best multinational workplaces by a great place to work, placing in the top 10 and joining a group of 25 elite global companies recognized for high trust, high performing workplace cultures in 2017. With that, I’m going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.3% versus the prior year on a currency-neutral basis due to strong leisure demand and international results. Calendar shifts displaced business travel and group demand in the quarter with the July 4th and Jewish holiday timing shifts weighing on July and September. System-wide we estimate the RevPAR benefits from hurricanes Harvey and Irma largely offset these major calendar shifts. Adjusted EBITDA of $524 million was above the high end of our guidance range and exceeded the midpoint by $24 million. Indeed, it was largely driven by better hotel performance and non-RevPAR driven fees, and some benefit from FX and onetime items. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 37% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 11% versus the prior year to $512 million, well ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range. Hotel performance and greater license fees drove outperformance in the fee segment, while continued strength in the UK and Japan led to better than expected results in our owned and leased portfolio. Turning to our regional performance and outlook. Comparable RevPAR in the U.S. was roughly flat with calendar driven group under performance particularly in convention business offset by continued strength in leisure. We estimate that the two major calendar shifts negatively weighed on U.S. RevPAR by approximately 70 basis points in the quarter partially offset by a lift in business from the aftermath of the hurricanes. We estimate that our hurricane-related benefit was less than the overall U.S. industry due to our meaningful occupancy share premiums in those markets. For full year 2017, we continue to forecast the U.S. RevPAR growth towards the lower half of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S. third quarter RevPAR grew 3.4% versus the prior year due to strength in Mexico, which was driven by strong transient demand. Leisure transient in particular saw high single digit room night growth for the quarter. For full 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range. RevPAR in Europe grew a solid 8% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in the UK, Turkey, and Spain. Additionally, international inbound to Europe was up nearly 11% in the quarter. We continue to expect full year 2017 RevPAR growth in the region to be in the mid-to-high single digits. In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR growth was up 20 basis points and significantly ahead of our expectations, as the reversal of the holiday shifts that benefited the second quarter were less of a drag than we anticipated. We saw strong group performance in Saudi Arabia, and improving leisure business in Egypt. For full year 2017, we now expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range. In the Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 8.3% in the quarter, led by strength in Greater China, which was up over 13%. RevPAR in China showed continued transient strength at both established and maturing assets. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be mid-to-high single digits with RevPAR in China up in the 9% of range. Moving on to capital return. We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 during the quarter, for a total of $147 million in dividends paid year-to-date. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share in the fourth quarter. We expect to return between $1 billion and $1.1 billion to shareholders or about 5% of our market cap through buybacks and dividends this year. Since initiating buybacks in March, we have purchased $693 million of shares at an average price per share of $63.17. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth between 1% and 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $453 million to $473 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.41 to $0.45. We’re maintaining our full year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%. As Chris mentioned, we expect full year growth at or slightly above the midpoint of the range. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $30 million at the midpoint to $1.93 billion an increase of more than 9% year-over-year. We’re also raising diluted EPS adjusted for special items to $1.87 to $1.91. Please note that our full year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Further details on our third quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning. So please limit yourself to one question and one related follow-up. Denise, can we have our first question please.
Operator: Absolutely Mr. Jacob. [Operator Instructions] And your first question this morning will come from Joe Greff of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Greff: Good morning everybody.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff: I know it’s early days here, Chris, so we appreciate your comments on the early read for 2018. But can you just talk about the same store RevPAR guidance for 2018, and how much of it is rolled up a corporate versus from the region, and then how do you think about it from a geographic and from a segmentation perspective relative to 2017?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, good question, and I know Joe, probably the number one question on people’s mind, is sort of what’s in front of us. So as we do every year, we go we’re sort of in the middle of budgets season now. We are to be honest, not complete with that, but towards the later stages of it. Certainly, we have a very good sense on the topline, which is why we’re happy to give some level of guidance there. And so, what I would describe it as is the case every year, we do it on a very granular basis. Every hotel in every region of the world has worked on a budget and those are all rolled up to aggregate to a global budget, regional and then a global budget. So this is not in any way top down. I mean we certainly have used top down, but this all happens bottoms up. In the guidance you would typically get from us is about what you’d expect, which is we’re aggregating it up. We have a budget and we’re trying to create an upside and a downside to that. So said another way, the expectations should be we are generally going to have budget. So they’re somewhere sort of the midpoint of that guidance range. And that the basis for that is, as I described in my introductory comments, which is a demand growth environment that we think is going to be steady to a little bit better. I mean the optimistic side of me says everybody still things GDP growth around the world and in the U.S. is going to tick up. Everybody still believe that we’re seeing it in our nonresidential fixed investment numbers are going to generally picking up, particularly here in the U.S. and that should lead to some incremental demand growth. The supply side, as I covered, is fairly stable. I mean various numbers are out there, but it’s generally somewhere at two or a little bit below, which is not too terribly different than what we’re seeing this year. So you put those two things together, I think our best assessment is that we’re going to have a year next year, at least as we look at it right now. We look at budgets, and we look at all regions of the world. We’re going to have a year – next year much like we’re seeing this year. In terms of the geographic representation, again I think it’s similar to this year. I would sort of at a high level say that topline growth is going to be here in the U.S. probably at the low to the midpoint of the range, and we would expect international growth to be greater, so probably at the midpoint to the high end of the range.
Joe Greff: Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from a Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. So Chris, as you kind of expanded on your thoughts on 2018. When you think about the one to three and you think about the – obviously a lot of proposals currently being thrown around right now, but if you were to get some form of tax reform. A, kind of how long do you think you start to see that show up in the operating results, and B, what kind of impact do you guys kind of foresee that having from at least a business transient perspective.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, another good question. I wish I knew the answer to that. I’m spending here – given that I’m inside the Beltway, we get a heavy dose of politics here when you live inside the Beltway in Washington. We obviously care a lot about tax reform for a whole bunch of reasons, so I definitely personally as well as others in our organization been very engaged with our industry and very directly with Congress is there, and the administration is there trying to figure out what path it will take. There are different forms of tax reform that is sort of coming together, there are some general themes that I think are now becoming pretty consistent rather than get in those individually. And those will, I think become clearer over the next week or two, because the things are moving quite rapidly, particularly in the house and then will flow over into the Senate. I think in the next week or so you’re going to start to see tax reform with much more specificity than the high level dialogue. And I would say very good into details, that I think generally it’s headed in a good direction, I would say just my personal opinion that there is a real opportunity that this gets done. I think that, that is time will tell. But I’d say you asked me last quarter versus this quarter, I would say, I’m much more optimistic this quarter that something will get done just based on the state of play, knowing exactly what gets done is the trick and I’d say we’re slightly premature on that. But from the standpoint of the industry, and then I’ll talk about Hilton in a very high level way. Again, it depends what happens. But I think generally for the industry, I think it’s good, I think like anything there’s a lag effect to good things happening, and those flowing through the business. I can’t tell you what that lag would be, I know there is a lag, but I think it happens in two forms honestly. One is psychology, which matters and that is the business community and others feeling better about where the economy is going. I think that can happen if tax reform gets done. I think that starts to flow through pretty quickly. And then the second form of benefit to the industry is just all of what tax reform means, which means businesses have more free cash flow to play with that means that they hire more people, they invest more in plant and equipment, nonresidential fixed investment, investments should go up, it means if it’s done. The way that I’m hearing it’s going to get done, you’re going to have huge amounts of repatriation of money that’s been trapped overseas coming home, some portion of that is obviously going to get put to use in those same ways. And those things may take a little bit of time to trickle through because it takes time for those benefits to flow through to businesses. But clearly those are benefits, and clearly, I think for the industry incrementally that helps drive positive demand. So I think, if they get it done, and as I say, I think there’s a reasonable probability that something gets done, I think net-net it’s good for the industry. I think for us, again just depends on the nuance of thousands of moving parts. We’ve looked at all of the various proposals, it could change, so I want to – full disclosure, I don’t – we don’t know exactly where it will come out. We’re in deep in the dialogue and have a reasonable sense. I think, the things that we’re hearing being talked about, I would say the net effect should be beneficial to us. Now trying to scale how good it is for us, I won’t do, just because it’s too early, too many moving parts, but certainly nothing that I’ve seen that’s on the table right now. Let me put it the positive. Everything I’ve seen this on the table right now would be beneficial to us like a lot of other businesses, because the whole point of this is the stimulus economic growth and get more hands, more cash in the hands of businesses to make more investments and hire more people, and I think we would be a net beneficiary of it.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, Chris, thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Hey, good morning everyone. Just wanted to talk a little bit about the select service brands again this quarter, I mean, I think we all expected the U.S. was going to be a little light, given all of the calendar shifts that were going on for the quarter. But we sort of look into decomposition, your select service brands were underperformed – some of the broader portfolio as we look at a particularly some of the big flagships like HCI and Hampton. So I guess the question is, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks a little bit about occupancy premiums there, and is there a place in as we progress through the balance to this year into 2018 where we might be able to get some price at those brands or what’s the competitive landscape look and outlook for that side of the portfolio as we head out to year?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, Shaun, obviously, good question, and those brands are an absolute RevPAR growth basis were at the lower end of our spectrum of brand this quarter. I think, I’ll hit the occupancy premium – I guess rate part of it. Second, but the first part those brands are very high RevPAR index brands, right, they perform really well. They start out ahead of the competition right, so there absolute RevPAR growth in the quarter is still higher than their competitors, but the other competitors are coming up partially because they do have such high occupancy premiums. You also had the effect in the quarter of a benefit from the storms, didn’t endure to those brands as much because they already, so far, had not seen, so the other hotels were filling up more quickly, or I guess, more incrementally more than they were. In terms of the rate side, what you’re seeing in those brands, I think is what you’re seeing overall which is that their recovery has not been as strong in GDP growth has not been as strong, and as a result, their inflationary environment has been quite low, so you haven’t seen as much rate growth. You should see – continue to see rate contribute more to RevPAR growth in the U.S. this year it’s almost one 100% of our RevPAR growth is from rate, less so outside the U.S. So it’s a bit of a mixed bag with those brands, but the end of the day those brands are really strong brands. They’re still preference by owners and lenders in a big way and they should continue to perform really well for us.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill Crow: Hi, good morning folks.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning Bill.
Bill Crow: Good morning. We’re not that far away from hitting kind of a three year anniversary of the time at which we identified weaker corporate demand. And we’re also still trying to figure out exactly why. And I know economic growth hasn’t been that good, but confidence is up. Corporate profit is up. You’ve highlighted many of those things. So I’m just wondering in your discussions with your clients, in your special corporate negotiated rates, is there anything you’re uncovering that helps to explain this weakness at this point in the cycle? And maybe growth is coming from small companies, not big companies or something like that, but anything that you can give us?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean it’s a really good question, right, in terms of going forward what it’s going to change to get the business transient moving at a faster pace. And we’ve studied it like crazy. I’ve talked personally as with our teams to all our corporate clients, big, small, medium everything. So I don’t have any – I’d love to tell you I have some brilliant new insight, but I don’t. I think it’s really a consequence of even though you see broader economic indicators and nonresidential fixed investment in those things sort of improving. I think it’s just been – I’ve used this before, I think, on prior calls certainly as I’ve talked to folks, it still been a little bit of a cautionary flag out there. So whether you’re big, small or medium sized business even though there is some optimism out there and maybe certainly tax reform within as I said improve that psychology, there’s enough stuff going on politically and globally that we’re all reading about and we all know about that. I think it just it’s holding people back from that incremental decision to spend and that includes incremental spending in travel. As we’ve talked to our corporate clients, it’s been interesting not particularly new, and I’ve talked to a bunch of them, I think what they’re saying, and you heard it in our prepared comments that we think we’ll have sort of 2% to 3% growth with them. That’s all rate. Okay, you wanted – somebody asked where is the rate? Well there it is. That’s all rate, sort of a quasi inflationary increase, simply because I think when you talk to them they say, hey we’re reasonably optimistic about our business in the world, but my gosh, a lot of things going on. We need to see things stabilize a little bit. I think people’s expectation at this moment as we’re talking to him pretax reform, et cetera, is I’m willing to accept the rate increase not a big one, but sort of inflationary and my expectation is and I’m aggregating a whole bunch of different people and a bunch of different categories, obviously, but I think volumes will be relatively constant. And so that’s sort of what we’ve built in as I described a bit earlier in my answer to the prior question. That’s sort of what we’ve built into our expectations for next year. To get them moving a little bit faster, I think, one, having – continuing to see an uptick in the broader economic environment. I think, getting – posting some wins on the board, I think honestly, I don’t want to put anything on the shoulders of tax reform, but I think that is the one we get the highest probability and where you’re going to have the most significant impact to sort of change the psychology a little bit to make people feel like we’re getting some things done, it’s going to be really good for me. My business is going to benefit from it, and so I can loosen the purse strings a little bit. I think having said that, we’re growing. I mean, special corporates are growing. You see business transient this year sort of growing over all in the 1% to 2% range. So it’s not flat going backwards, it’s still positive. But not nearly what we would like or what you would typically see at this stage of the cycle. But I think this is different just because of the noise that’s in the system and the overall caution. And I’m an optimist by nature, everybody on the call knows that. But I am optimistic that particularly tax reform and other, you start to see things settle down and I think it will be helpful to the business. But we haven’t really – I can’t say that I can look at data – I mean, I can look out if I wanted to sort of be super optimistic, I can look at certain weeks and a little bit of a trend that it’s getting a little bit better. But I would say I’m getting ahead of myself to say that I’d say that the bulk of the data, which has been somewhat choppy, still suggest it’s been positive, but relatively stable. We haven’t really seen any kind of material uptick.
Operator: The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi, good morning and thank you. Chris, in an industry that doesn’t have a lot of visibility, we rely on metrics like GDP and corporate demand to kind of try to form the forecast, and you talked about those a lot. And I’m just curious because it seems like the corporate demand – I’m sorry, I meant, not to say nonresidential fixed income. And it seems like corporate demand this year has led nonresidential fixed investment. So I’m just wondering why you think it wasn’t as correlated this year? Is there a lag or is that maybe not the best metric to look at?
Chris Nassetta: It’s a really good question, and I’ve been pushing our teams on that. And we’ve studied – the best analysis that we’ve come up with is the correlation is still very, very strong but it’s a longer lag in a low inflationary environment, and that’s the environment that we have been in and we can likely will be in for a while. So I do think it will flow through. Correlation in a low inflationary environment will probably mean a lower correlation and a longer lag. So if you keep seeing growth in nonresidential fixed investment, eventually you’re going to see some benefit flowing through the hotel demand.
Felicia Hendrix: Looks like a good basis, and then combined with GDP that’s…
Chris Nassetta: It’s still the best – I mean, when you do the math and look at the RF squares, It’s not to be too nerdy about it, but that’s how our guys look at it. It’s still – those are still the best ways we can find. You’re right, it has detached a bit and so I was – Kevin and I were pushing the teams. And when you do the analysis, it really has a lot to do – if you look at it over 30 or 40 years against different inflationary environments, that’s as best we can tell, where it starts to break apart at least in terms of creating greater lags.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay, helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from question will come from Brian Dobson of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead,
Brian Dobson: Hi, good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Brian Dobson: So when you’re looking at supply growth, is there any sign that, that might be slowing in urban markets where supply has been high and pricing has been weak? And then in terms of your own growth out over the next two years, which of your brands are driving that growth? And how developers received your new brands?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, thanks Brian. So the first one is I think you are seeing indications that, well, certainly, new projects getting signed up in urban environments are more difficult to finance and you had a bunch s market where supply has become a little bit of a problem. So obviously, developers are looking else where. You’re still seeing deliveries in some of those markets, right? New York, Chicago, the oil patch, you’re still delivering some of that. So on a lag, you’re still going to see actual supply deliveries, continue a little bit, but I think if you look at projections more broadly outside of Urban, you’re starting to see the forecasters or the forecast are starting to level off. So I think what the industry consultants would predict is that 2019 is going to be the peak year. And we probably – I’d probably personally take the under on that a little bit, meaning I think 2018 and 2019 will be about the same and then you’ll sort of see them be collective, peak going forward. For us, in terms of our brands, you still have the core Hilton brand and Hampton that are the largest part of the pipeline and this will be the largest deliveries. But of course, we have new brands that are ramping quickly with Tru and Home2 and some of our conversion brands, so I think you’ll continue to see our work supply growth in our deliveries be more of the same. The trends will continue.
Brian Dobson: All right, great. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling: Hey, thanks, good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling: This is somewhat a bigger picture question, but given all the efforts and the connected room and that, how do you think about the right amount or even general benchmarking of technology spend? And could provide any additional details on kind of major CapEx markets of this year and how back is the ball going forward?
Chris Nassetta: Sure. I mean, technology makes up a huge component of how we want to differentiate ourselves broadly. I mean, I think it’s a combination, obviously, of making sure our physical products existing and you are exactly what customers want. And we’re either launching or adapting to their needs. That the physicals combined with service that is differentiated and very consistent and very high quality that our loyalty as we continue to evolve, Honors becomes – much increasingly more relevant. They were interacting with customers in a deeper, more frequent way. And last but not least, using technology as a differentiator, recognizing that we can use technology in ways we talked about today in our prepared comments in the on-property experience to make it more seamless, better, more fun, more efficient. But also, we have unique opportunities to talk to our customers in ways we never have been able to before, before and after they’re with us and technology obviously offers us a way not only to talk to them, but to engage them in different ways on a more frequent basis. So we’re front of mind. Obviously, all with an objective of being able to continue drive more market share, more profitability for owners and in so doing, attracting more capital into our system to accelerate our growth. So you’re going to continue to see us make very large investments in technology. The bulk of those investments in terms of the dollars are really coming out of our all of our programs and technology funds that come from contributions that are made by all of our owners on a global basis and not as much as what you see the pure CapEx numbers that you see in the $150 million to $200 million CapEx number that you’re seeing than when we talk about our CapEx fees, the amount in technology there is probably $20 million to $40 million. I’m looking at Kevin, something like that. And that’s really more corporate systems of all sorts. HR, financial systems, et cetera, that are really Hilton investments. I think you’ll continue to see that level of investment there. The big investments, which honestly are10 times to 15 times or more of that number that we’re making in terms of the innovation and what we’re doing with technology in the hotels is happening in the funded side of the business. And I think you’re going to continue to – we have a huge amount of resources to play with. I think, you’re going to continue to see us increased spending there is somewhat. But really just make sure that how we’re allocating dollars and what we spend it on and how we prioritize it is done – is appropriate for what we’re trying to get done to deliver great experiences for customers. We got plenty of money in that bucket to do the right things. It really is making sure we just focus on the right things and prioritize properly.
Operator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: Hi good morning and congrats on another strong quarter. So two more So two more questions on 2018. First, Chris, you had the conference recently and you talked about some potential new brand launches. Can you just tell us your expectations for 2018 and potential size of new brands? And can you talk about capital returns for 2018, just the gives and takes of all the driving capital return side.
Chris Nassetta: I’ll take the first, maybe ask Kevin to talk about the second. New brands. Nothing new from what we talked about in prior calls. We’re always working on lots of different ideas. I’d say we have four new brand ideas that are sort of in the skunk works and under heavy development. We talked about those. We affectionately call our Hilton Plus – sort of Hilton Plus brand, an urban micro brand, what I did talked about get, the luxury collection brand and I think that’s all – sorry, luxury lifestyle, I was saying. I have three or four, luxury lifestyle. I’d say three of the four of those, the first three the luxury lifestyle being the fourth, we’re way down the development path of luxury lifestyle. We’re not rushing as much because we have a number of different things going and other three that are keeping us busy. I would expect and I don’t want to – it’s not a high commitment but I would expect probably the launch of two or three of those four during 2018. And it sort of depends. It’s hard to put a hard date on it because we just launched really Tru and I mean we launched it a couple of years ago, we had the first opening that are going on this year and just launched Tapestry this year at our first opening. We’re still cranking up with Curio and even Home2, which is doing incredibly well. We’ve had five new brands over a relatively short period of time, to effectively this year. So we want to make sure, I say pretty consistently, that we give them a proper birth. They’re all doing well, but we want to give them a little bit more room, finish the development on these others. So I would say two or three of the four, I think, are highly likely at some point next year. And as we get into the beginning of next year, I think we’ll give you a little bit more specificity around that.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. And then Thomas, on capital return, as Chris mentioned earlier, we haven’t finished our budgeting process. So it’s a little bit premature and we’re certainly not giving guidance. But I think if you look at what we’re saying about RevPAR growth and those combined for next year, I think it’s safe to say that EBITDA will grow next year based on our outlook and thus, free cash flow will grow. We expect our return on capital next year to be directionally comparable with this year. And I think the thing to a number about that and the reason that it will probably be directionally comparable even with growth is we had some excess cash at the beginning of this year left over from the spend that is part of our capital return for this year.
Thomas Allen: Helpful, thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Thomas.
Operator: The next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I was just wondering if you can update us on the bookings channels, given all the efforts you’ve made around loyalty programs and the apps and the technology that you touched on earlier. Are you seeing a movement to more customers booking direct through your Hilton.com and away from, say, OTAs or other channels? And if you can, could you quantify the move?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I don’t have all the most recent data in front of me. But I would say directionally, things are going really well with our book direct campaign. We continue to see tremendous growth coming in through Honors, which is the way to get started. We’ve been doing more than 1 million new members a month. We’re up to about 70 million numbers. We’re almost up 30, I think it’s 26% to 27% year-to-date growth in Honors. And that obviously, as we get people onto the system, gives us an opportunity to talk to them and engage with them in a very different way, which we are, including them and making sure they understand that they get the best value with discounts with points, with all the technological advantages that we talked about in terms of digital check-in, room selection, digital key all of those things that are offered to Honors members. And I think it’s going really well. If you look at the channel shift over the last couple of years, it continues to pay the highest growth that we’re seeing on a year-to-date basis continues to be in our direct channels. And I think we’ll continue to see that if we do our job. As I’ve said lots of different times over the last couple of years, this is not going to be – we’re happy to talk about at quarter-to-quarter until it’s appropriate to get the question and answer it. But we’ll be talking about this for years and years to come. This will never end. It wasn’t sort of a onetime surge. It’s about making sure that we’re always offering our customers the best value and delivering the best experience. And as much as we can, as I said, engaging in a deeper, more frequent way with them to have a very direct relationship. We think that’s important. That doesn’t mean we don’t want to have relationships with distribution partners. We do. We have literally hundreds of them around the world and we have good relationships with them, and there is a certain segment of our business where it’s very helpful to us to work with them as long as we have reasonable economic terms and we’ll continue to do so. But the more that we can add those direct relationships, the better, not just because of the cost of distribution. That’s obviously an element of it, but just experience for our customers that we can have much more control over the experience. So you’re going to see us – you’re going to see lots of new things coming from us and our marketing campaigns on what you’re doing with the digital side, overall technology. We talked about some of them today. Things that we’re doing with Honors like connecting the Amazon and points building. All of these things are really of part of that equation of giving our customers or reasons to want to engage more often, more deeply with us and to have all the more reason to have a direct relationship with us. And we think it will ultimately drive distribution cost down and is driving distribution cost. Down to be clear, it is, but it will also ultimately drive share up because it will drive more loyalty.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning, guys. Hilton and other brands certainly have a few initiatives in progress such as revamping cancellation policies, I guess, you call it nonrefundable reservations. And I’ve heard that you and maybe other folks are revamping like the rewards redemption programs out there to make it little more favorable to orders. I’m just curious for Hilton, do you expect these programs will be adopted system-wide actually at some point in 2018? And, I guess, which of them do you think ultimately could be the most beneficial to room rates or RevPAR?
Kevin Jacobs: Jeff, I’ll take the cancellation policy first. We did instituted a new cancellation policy this year. We’re actually in the third quarter where we’re now at a combination of 48 and 72 hours depending on the market. And earlier, it’s early days, but the early returns are that those are working, those are helping stem the tide of really short-term cancellation. So you’re seeing sort of one-day out cancellations down a few points as we get into that. We’re also working on – I’m not exactly sure what you’re referring to or you’re hearing, but we’re working on and testing, I think Chris has spoken about this before on calls testing, a new way to price where maybe the customer’s paying a little bit more or a little bit less in advance for different levels of flexibility. And then on the Honors side, we made changes in recent years on the redemption formula to make it more fair to all owners whether they’re in high occupancy markets or otherwise. But I don’t know if you want to elaborate more on that.
Chris Nassetta: No, I don’t think there’s any major changes in the redemption side of Honors to speak at about at this point. I think Kevin covered others. Is there anything else, Jeff, that you were trying to get at?
Jeff Donnelly: No, I think that’s a large part of it. I was curious, I know it’s early, but I’m meaning the cancellation policy has been successful and kind of lengthening booking window? I mean, how do you guys kind of think about it with a desired goal?
Chris Nassetta: It’s really early days, okay, but meaning months in. But it’s definitely working. And I think that, as Kevin said in concert, we’re rolling out next year, changes in sort of how we price all our products, sort of taking it from the 48 or 72 hours to seven days and then seven days and beyond with a flexible or semi-flexible product pricing approach, I think, is going to help accelerate – help benefit us and deal with this issue in a more meaningful way. And ultimately, in a way that I think drives higher growth just because as we look at the behavior of customers as we are testing it, as we’re doing it at a fairly large scale throughout different pockets of the portfolio, we like what we see. And I think net-net, it has an opportunity to incrementally make customers happier by giving them choice and drive better RevPAR growth. Now you’re going to say give me more details, but I’m going to say I’m not yet, because we’re deep into the testing, I think we’re going to complete it the next 30 or 45 days and if all goes well, it’s something we’ll describe and in far greater detail, because we’ll be rolling it out next year.
Jeff Donnelly: Thanks for answering my third question. Thanks guys.
Operator: The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin Farley: Great. Two things. One, just wanted to understand the group pace a little bit better, I know you said its up during the quarter. I’m wondering how much that may just be benefiting from the holiday shift that makes Q4 better quarter than last year. Can you talk about what bookings that came in during Q3 for 2018 versus last year in Q3 for the forward year?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, Robin, I don’t have the exact breakdown in front of me, but booking – pace was up in the quarter both into the fourth quarter and for all future periods and as far as 2018 how is looking right now, it’s actually, 2018 position is up more so then 2017 position is going to end – we think is going to end up on the whole, so up sort of low single digits, but up better than it is this year.
Robin Farley: Okay, that’s great. And lastly, so much upside in your guidance rate since your RevPAR range changed to sort of non-RevPAR related fees. Is that – should we think about that as recurring? Or is that just sort of onetime benefit to the upside in your guidance today?
Chris Nassetta: The overall there were – there were a little bit of unique items, a little bit of FX and a little bit of timing. But largely as I think I said in my prepared remarks, largely performance driven. And then the reference to the non-RevPAR driven fees we have a bunch of non-RevPAR driven fees including franchise sales and license fees and you saw a little bit of benefit in the quarter particularly from license fees.
Robin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian: Hey, good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Jared Shojaian: So we’ve seen the industry pipeline the growth rate start to decelerate a bit year-to-date and then your number today is sort of in line with that. What do you make of this trend, and how should we think about your unit growth beyond next year?
Chris Nassetta: I mean, if I look at our numbers, we didn’t really see any meaningful deceleration. I think, we were – pipeline growth 13% and I think last quarter maybe fifteen, so I guess technically that’s a decel, but I don’t really – I think that just quarter-to-quarter nuance of things going on. I don’t think that’s happening. My expectation is that you will continue to see our pipeline grow overtime obviously has a lot to do with what’s going on in the various regions of the world, but I think you’ll continue to see us add to the pipeline at a rate that is somewhere in that zone. In terms of our net unit growth, as I talked about in the prepared comments, we have pretty good sightlines just because if you think about it everything that we’re going to deliver next year and a whole bunch of stuff that we’re going to deliver into 2019 is either under construction or financed and getting ready to go under construction with the meaningful piece – meaningful gap being conversions. We’ve been doing roughly 20% to 25% conversions a year. We’ve done that four or more reliably. We have new conversion brands that we’re working with Curio, with Tapestry, with soon a luxury collection conversion brands. So I’m pretty confident based on our track record, based on the sort of weapons in our arsenal, will be able to get the conversions that we need. So I think looking in 2018, 2019, I think looking as we said in our Analyst Day this time last year, I think we have pretty good sightlines. I think being in that 6% to 7% zone for the next few years, I think is readily achievable.
Jared Shojaian: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered, but I do have one on you. On the Waldorf Astoria in New York City, I wonder if you have any idea when that might be reopening, I walk by it every day, and I don’t see a lot of activity going on any rough idea?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean a lot of work is going on, not in the hotel, but behind the scenes on all of the planning. And I – bunch of us have been deeply involved on buying and figuring out the programming and I think we’re sort of at the very final stages of that. They’ve done a bit of demolition sort of what I’d say is demolition to figure out what’s behind all those walls in a building that whatever 100 years old, it gets tricky and what they have said is their expectation is to open in the very late part of this year, very early part of next year that they’re going to be prepared to start heavy demolition elements which obviously are the beginning of real construction. So I’m hopeful that the next three to six months that we’re starting to get underway. The program that we’ve worked on with them is, I think spectacular. I mean, I personally spent a bunch of time on it has tons of people on our team. And I think the direction it’s going will make us proud to have the Waldorf Astoria, New York back to its former glory.
Patrick Scholes: Well said. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks everybody for the time today, obviously I’m pleased with our third quarter. I think – rest of the year, I think we’re in really good shape and going into next as we talked about. Steady as she goes. We’ll keep churn in the numbers out and appreciate everybody spending their time with us and look forward to talking to you after our next quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen the conference has concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. At this time you may disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Jill Slattery, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you. Denise. Welcome to Hilton's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the risk factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at IR.Hilton.com. Unless otherwise noted comparisons to the company's second quarter 2016 results assume that the spinoff transactions had occurred on January 1, 2016. Please see our earnings release for additional details. This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our second quarter results and provide an update on our expectations for the year. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our second quarter as the new Hilton, and I think our results continue to demonstrate the strength of our fee-driven business model. It starts with the best performing portfolio of brands in the business, which are driving record organic unit growth with minimal investment. Add to that, solid same-store growth driven by positive industry fundamentals, and you end up with significant and growing free cash flow, all of which we intend to return to shareholders. Turning specifically to results, we reported adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS above the high end of our guidance for the second quarter, and we're also raising our expectations for the full year including our outlook for capital return. We now expect to return $1 billion to $1.1 billion to shareholders this year, or over 5% of our market cap. Our RevPAR index premium increased 60 basis points in the quarter with positive growth in every brand segment and in every region. Top-line results in the quarter were generally as expected with system-wide RevPAR growth of 1.8%. Netting the benefit of July 4th and the downward pressure from Easter, calendar shifts weighed on results by approximately 70 basis points. When you boil it all down, system-wide year-to-date transient and group growth have generally been consistent with our expectations with business transient and group towards the midpoint of our guidance range, and leisure transient a bit above the high end. Looking forward, expectations for macro indicators such as GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment growth suggest continued improvement. But so far, we have not seen that translate into increased demand. As a result, our forecast would suggest the midpoint of our RevPAR range for the full year. On unit growth, we continue to drive a disproportionate share of global development to our system. Nearly one in every four rooms under construction around the world are slated to be added to our system, and we continue to have more rooms under construction in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia Pacific than anyone. In the second quarter, we opened more than 13,000 net managed and franchised rooms, and remain on track to deliver roughly 6.5% net unit growth for the full year. We also approved over 27,000 rooms in the quarter, well on our way to achieving more than 100,000 rooms approved for the full year. Our pipeline totals over 330,000 rooms, up roughly 15% year-over-year, and represents more than 40% of our existing supply. With over half of our pipeline under construction, we have good visibility into unit growth over the next several years. We continue to make great progress on our luxury development strategy. We had a very positive response to the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills opening just last month. This opening marks Waldorf Astoria's West Coast expansion, offering global travelers a new standard of luxury in one of California's most prestigious ZIP Codes. We expect this spectacular property, along with other recent openings, like the Conrad Osaka, the Conrad Guangzhou, the Conrad San Luis Potosi, and upcoming openings like the Conrad Fort Lauderdale, the Waldorf Astoria Chengdu, and a soon to be announced luxury hotel in Midtown Manhattan to drive a nearly 15% increase in our luxury distribution in this year alone. And we expect to continue seeing double digit luxury growth for the next several years. Our newest brands also continue to perform very well. Home2 Suites celebrated its 150th opening in the second quarter, with its 200th opening expected by year-end. With nearly 400 hotels in the pipeline, Home2 continues to have the largest pipeline of any suites brand. Guests love Home2's product and service offering, and owners love its performance. In the quarter, the brand increased its RevPAR index by over 500 basis points, and Home2, barely six years since launch, already runs RevPAR premiums well above our system average. Tru by Hilton opened its first three hotels in the second quarter, with the first marking our 5,000th hotel. By year-end, we expect to have ten Tru hotels opened, with construction starts on an incremental 5,000 Tru rooms. We believe that Tru will attract new customers into our system and enable us to enter new markets. To-date, nearly one in five of our signed Tru deals are in cities where our current brands are not present. In the quarter Tapestry Collection opened its first property, the Hotel Skyler. This unique eco-friendly hotel is a former temple located in the heart of Syracuse, New York, and is only one of 11 LEED Platinum certified hotels in the world. The property perfectly illustrates the spirit of our Collection brands, which allows hotels to maintain their unique identity while benefiting from the strength of our commercial engines. Both of our Collection brands, Curio and now Tapestry, continue to gain momentum across the U.S. and globally. With nearly 150 hotels opened and in development, we are quickly growing our system without increasing overall industry supply. Curio celebrated some important developments over the last few months, including debuting properties in China, France, and Italy. We also welcomed the world renowned Hotel del Coronado to our Curio Collection. This iconic 130-year-old property is a great addition to our growing portfolio of unique hotels and resorts. We look forward to unveiling additional Collection properties in Costa Rica, the Florida Keys, Paris, and London later this year. On the innovation front, we've begun deploying our industry-leading digital key outside the United States, and remain on track to have over 2,500 hotels, or nearly half our system, equipped with this guest-centric capability by year-end. Hilton Honors members continue to set new records for usage and engagement through our app, with over 3.5 million digital check-ins and nearly 1 million room keys downloaded in the quarter alone. Guests love the choice and control that the Honors app enables, as seen in guest satisfaction scores that increase on average 400 basis points when guests use our digital key. Innovations like the Hilton Honors app continue to drive growth in Honors. Year-to-date, 5.5 million people have joined the club, a 20% increase year-over-year, and we had our first month with over 1 million enrollments in the quarter. Hilton Honors occupancy increased 170 basis points versus the prior year, while paid member folio rose 9% year-over-year to $5 billion in the quarter, a system record. With the most guest-centric loyalty program and the efficiency of our web direct channels, guests benefit from greater personalization and more choice and control and best value. At the same time, owners benefit from lower distribution costs and continued increases in system RevPAR premiums. To further Hilton Honors' ability to drive demand to our system, we recently announced our partnership with American Express, which we believe is a big win for both companies, and for all stakeholders. Effective January next year, Amex will launch and aggressively market a refreshed portfolio of Hilton Honors credit cards in the United States that will help grow our Hilton Honors membership and deepen member engagement. We will also have the opportunity to grow transient and group market share at favorable economics through American Express and its travel assets, as well as provide owners a meaningful reduction in merchant fees. For Hilton, the growth of card spend in this partnership should benefit license fee growth. We expect all license fees, including co-brand and HGV, as a percentage of total fees to be around 11% this year and would expect for that to go up around 200 basis points in 2018 and grow in line to above core fee growth going forward. Lastly, I'd like to share some recent news that we're very proud of, and to thank many of our team members whose efforts led to these achievements. Hilton was named the number one military friendly company for 2017 by both GI Jobs and Military Spouse magazines. We owe this honor in large part to our commitment to Operation: Opportunity. Through this initiative, we've hired more than 10,000 veterans and spouses over the last four years, and we just recently have committed to hiring another 20,000 by the end of 2020. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the results and our outlook. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 1.8% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis due to strong leisure demand and international results. Year-to date, which largely neutralizes for holiday shifts, RevPAR growth is up 2.4% versus the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA of $519 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $9 million, largely driven by better than expected fee growth and out-performance in owned and leased hotels. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.52, exceeding the high end of our guidance range and increasing 30% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. In the quarter, management franchise fees grew nearly 11% versus the prior year to $513 million, well ahead of our 7% to 9% guidance range. In addition to timing related items, greater license and incentive management fees drove outperformance in the fee segment, while transient occupancy gains in London and rate gains in Japan led to solid results in our owned and leased portfolio. Turning to our regional performance and outlook, we believe our broad geographic diversity continues to lower the effects of volatility in individual markets. In the U.S. comparable RevPAR increased 50 basis points driven by good leisure transient trends and somewhat offset by softer group performance due to the Easter shift. Additionally, weakness in oil and gas markets pressured results in the quarter. For full year 2017, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the lower half of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR grew a solid 6.5% versus the prior year due to strength in Mexico and Canada, which was driven by strong transient demand in both regions. Leisure transient in particular saw double digit RevPAR growth across the region. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range. RevPAR in Europe also grew 6.5% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in London and Continental Europe, namely the Netherlands, Germany and Spain. Additionally, international inbound to the UK was up nearly 14% in the second quarter, helped by favorable exchange rates. Given the beat coupled with raised expectations for the balance of the year, we expect full year 2017 RevPAR growth in the region to be in the mid-single digits. In Middle East and Africa, robust second quarter RevPAR growth of 10% benefited from stronger leisure volume largely due to holiday shifts which should reverse in the third quarter. We saw good group performance in Saudi Arabia, transient strength in the UAE and improving leisure business in Egypt. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region of flat to slightly positive. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7% in the quarter led by strength in Japan and China. RevPAR in China was boosted by stronger transient volume at both established and maturing assets. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth for the region to be mid-single digits with RevPAR in China up in the 8% to 9% range. Moving on to capital return, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the quarter for a total of $98 million in dividends paid year-to-date. Our Board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the third quarter. As Chris mentioned, we now expect to return between $1 billion and $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends this year. Since initiating buybacks in March, we have bought $425 million of shares through July and expect to buy a similar incremental amount by year-end. With the resiliency of our business model, a point of RevPAR growth is about a point of adjusted EBITDA growth, making it largely immaterial to our capital return potential. For the third quarter of 2017, as expected, an unfavorable calendar shift in the days of week for July 4th and the timing of the Jewish holidays which fell in the fourth quarter last year should result in system-wide RevPAR growth of 0% to 2%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $490 million to $510 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.47 to $0.51. We are maintaining our full year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%. As Chris mentioned, we expect full year growth towards the midpoint of the range. We are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook by $20 million to $1.9 billion at the midpoint. Even with relatively modest same-store RevPAR growth, we expect to grow 2017 adjusted EBITDA by 7% to 9%, or roughly 4 times the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance, demonstrating the strength of our fee-based business model. We are raising diluted EPS adjusted for special items to $1.78 to $1.85. Please do note that our full year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Further details on our second quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. Lastly, we were recently added to the S&P 500, an index widely regarded as the best gauge for high quality large cap U.S. equities. We view this as a great milestone for our company and are proud to be part of this prestigious group of companies. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Jacobs. And your first question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Harry.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Chris, good morning. Chris, based on your relationships at the highest levels with your key customers, what are the economic and political tea leaves that they need to see before dialing up spending on transient travel?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's the $64,000 question. A good one. I'd say – I've been talking to a lot of our corporate customers actually in the last couple of months, and I would say people are, sort of, cautiously optimistic in the sense that they see the economy as continuing to show decent resiliency, obviously positive growth. I think, everybody would like to see a little bit more clarity on public policy on some of the things that they care about the most to unleash a little bit more optimism in the hiring, spending and consequently demand for hotel room nights. I think, this – probably the single biggest thing that might help change the psychology with our corporate customers is some positive movement in the area of tax reform. I mean, there's a whole bunch of stuff going on politically right now, and legislatively, all of which can matter, regulatory change certainly could matter. But I think tax reform is probably singly the thing that I hear about most from people, simply because I think people have wanted it a long time. The impact of it would be positive in the sense of driving more free cash flow into people's businesses, so they'd have more to play with to hire and invest. And so I'd say – I would say probably that, although not only that. But generally as I talk to corporate customers as we think about the rest of this year, and particularly into next year, as I said, they're sort of cautiously optimistic. I'd say their attitude has been business is pretty good, growth is okay, we'd like it to be better. As they think about going into next year, their travel spend. I think, people generally view that their budgets are going to be going up, I think probably, with the U.S. as a surrogate for the moment, probably, you know, volumes that are relatively stable with rates that are going up some. I think people, even though they're cautious, understand that they're going to have increases inflationary plus kind of increases next year. But at the moment, I'd say people generally are looking at travel budgets that, in the corporate side, that are going to be higher next year. The question is, how much higher, and I think that gets back to seeing what happens with the broader economy as a result of some of the things that are going on in the political world.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Chris, you talked a little bit about the partnership and the January 1, 2018 launch. I don't know if you guys could provide any color, but I believe there was at least some influence from this transaction that we saw in the 2Q. And I just wanted to maybe briefly cover that. And then if I could just get some clarity on the license fees? I think, you called out 11% of total fees in 2017 going to 13% in 2018. Is that off an assumed 2018 fee number, or is that kind of off of a stable base and the mix just goes up by 200 basis points?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I mean, I think the way to – I'm taking the second one first, assume a sort of normalized rate of growth on fees. You can go back to what we gave you last year at the end of the year at the Analyst Day and then take the percentage of that. I mean, basically we're saying it's a 200 basis point increase. That's not all the co-brand relationship here or with other co-brand relationships we have around the world, it's some HGV as well. We sort of put it in the – all of it in the bucket together. But largely that – and the largest part of that increase that you'd see is being driven by the co-brand relationship. In Q2, there was a modest benefit even though the deal really doesn't go fully live till January of next year with the new cards and all that. There are elements of it that did go retroactively live to the beginning of this year in terms of what they pay for points and things. And that – as a result of signing it in the second quarter, there was a bit of a catchup that did have a modest benefit in license fees in Q2.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then if I missed it, I apologize, but in terms of your outlook on group for the back half of the year and kind of pacing, is there anything notable that shifted from your commentary post the 1Q?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I wouldn't say anything meaningful. You did not miss it, we didn't talk about it. I was fairly confident we would get asked in Q&A, so I decided I'd leave the group commentary for Q&A. Here's how I would describe group overall, so that – to answer your question. It is weaker in the second half of the year than it was in the first half. That was fully expected from the beginning of when we started budgeting last year just for a whole bunch of reasons in terms of how the groups are cycling through. That is almost entirely driven by Q3 being weaker. There are a couple – you know, a few things going on there. The 4th of July hurts a lot the beginning of the third quarter just because basically it became a week of no business, no group travel. The shift in the Jewish holidays between September and October, it has a big impact on group in the third quarter. The pace in Q2 into Q3 was a bit weaker. Having said that, the fourth quarter is quite strong on the group side. Actually, the pace in Q2 for Q4 was up. So it really is sort of a – from everything we're seeing sort of a Q3 phenomena that's driving the second half of the year. If we look at sort of position this year and then look at position going into next year, position for group going into next year is still meaningfully above the position that we see for this year at this point.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great, Chris. Thank you so much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: You bet.
Operator: The next question will be from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Chris, Kevin, do you think U.S. RevPAR grows in the 3Q similarly to what you experienced in the 2Q? Or does it take a little bit of a lay down just given some of the calendar shifts that you referred to?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that's a really good question, and we've got a bunch of incoming calls this morning on sort of Q2 being 0.5 in the U.S. I think, it requires some context before I answer, and that is there is a lot of crazy stuff going on with calendar, day of week and holiday shifts this year, more than the average. And so if you look at the numbers which we obviously have done and you sort of cleanse the whole year of all these holiday shifts between Easter, 4th of July, the Jewish holidays, and some other things that are lesser impactful, but nonetheless are impacting the results. What actually is happening is, first of all, first half versus second half is roughly the same, although believe it or not second half is better in the U.S. than the first half when you cleanse it for all those things. And if you look at it quarter-by-quarter, the weakest quarters are the first quarter and the third quarter, and the strongest are the second quarter and the fourth quarter. So when you cleanse it for the holiday shift, Q2 was better than Q1. I mean, I gave you the number in my prepared comments that we had a 70 basis point sort of net impact of 4th of July and Easter. If you relate that to the U.S., call it a point, you know, a point impact means that roughly the U.S. would have been in Q2 net of all that. about 1.5 points. If you do the same sort of math in Q1, it's a bit less than a point. So I think what's going on, when I net all of that out, when I look at the data, sort of, like – and this is what I would hope you guys would want to hear from me, sort of, is there anything like big movements that are going on? I think that all these holiday shifts are creating the appearance that there's a bunch of big stuff going on. I think, there isn't. In my opinion what's going on is sort of steady as she goes. That's what I said with our team. As you look at – I mean, there are some ups and downs quarter-by-quarter even when you cleanse it, but the bottom line on the business right now is you've got business transient that is growing, but not with as much strength as we would like. Sort of to the low to the midpoint of our guidance range. You have group that's sort of been towards the midpoint of the range, and you've had leisure transient that's been sort of at the high end. You've had relative strength there. And while I can pick month-to-month, a little bit here and there, you know, when you really sort of look through it all, that's what's going on. That sort of shouldn't be surprising to anybody given what's going on with the broader economy, certainly here in the U.S. I mean, out around the world, we – Kevin covered a bunch of the stats. Very different setup. But still, 72% of our business is here in the U.S. so it's driving the bulk of the result. It's pretty much steady as she goes, and it's a consequence of broader economic growth that is positive, but not particularly robust. And so my expectation as I – we sifted through data, studying every number known to man, obviously getting ready for today, is you're sort of in that range. We targeted the midpoint of our range because that's what our forecast is. I feel pretty confident of that. But you're sort of in that 1% to 3% range until something happens, a la Harry Curtis's first question about what has to happen to make corporates feel better. There needs to be something else to happen to sort of get you out of that range. And until then, we're in that range. Now, the good news story for us is we can be in the middle of that range at 2%, you can add 6% to 7% new unit growth, and we're driving bottom line growth of 7% to 9% in what is, from a same store point of view, fine and good and stable. By the way as I said, I don't – I wouldn't read too much into these quarter-to-quarter shifts because I view it as pretty stable, but we're taking a relatively sort of modest growth environment and creating, I think, a darn good result on the bottom line in terms of growing EBITDA and growing cash flow as a consequence of the resiliency of this model. But, I think, it's important – that's a longer answer than I know you wanted, but I think it's important context because I think it's easy to get – and you only have the data that you get, it's easy to get caught up in these big shifts that are going on quarter to quarter. If you cleanse it, there's really not that much going on quarter to quarter.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you. And then one quick question for Kevin. You increased your guidance for cash available for capital return. What – I mean, I know it's not an enormous change, but what drove that upward move?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Sure. There's a little bit – obviously a little bit...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: 10%.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. 10% is pretty good. A little bit of it, of course, was the upward revision of the EBITDA guide, Joe. Of course, a little bit of it is just refining our forecast as we're halfway through the year and we're thinking about our cash uses for the balance of the year. A little bit of lower cash taxes, and there was a little bit of – there was a modest incentive baked into the co-brand card deal that we signed that came through in the second quarter, which helped in that $100 million.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. And the 3Q and 4Q, do you have incrementally more license fees coming from the credit card deal, or is it – what's in the full year is just related to the 2Q?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. We had a bit of a catch up. It's built into the numbers we've given you. We had a bit of a catch-up in Q2 which I talked about because it went retro to January 1, and then we built – everything else is built into Q3 and Q4 guidance – or Q3 and full year guidance that we gave you.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Got it. Thank you so much, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Shaun.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Chris, maybe just stick with the same thing on the U.S. RevPAR performances. Kind of a two-part question, but I guess, the first one, because I think – a number of investors are just wondering directly, do you think there's any chance or risk that Q3 RevPAR in the U.S. could dip to negative? Or do you think we still stick in positive territory despite all the calendar shifts? Not to hold you to a specific number, but I think people are a little bit worried about the headline there. And then maybe...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, okay. You want me to...
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Sorry, go ahead.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'll tackle that one, and then you can keep going. I'd say Q3 as reported, I think, will be positive, although it will be in the – it will be low. If you cleanse it again for the holiday shift things that I'm saying, in my opinion, it's clearly positive.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you for that. I think that's helpful for folks. And then the second part would just be, when we look at the brand breakdown a little bit, it doesn't look like some of the more midscale and upscale brands were some of the contributors to that lower RevPAR performance. And again, we're not getting those brands domestically, so it's not going to be a perfect comp for us. But can you just give us a sense of any fears or question marks you might have around new supply growth that you're seeing in some of those chain scales in particular? And could that be dragging down our RevPAR performance? Or do you not think that that's a particular impact right now?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's – it's a good question. The honest answer, I mean, we've obviously looked – the honest answer is there is more supply coming there than you are seeing in the other segments. So logically, there has to be a bit of impact there. Although that, I would say – we've studied it like all these things quite carefully, and I don't think that's the majority of what has caused the RevPAR growth in some of those brands to be at the lower end of what we're reporting. I think it has a lot to do with some other things. First, keep in perspective that all of those brands are category killers. So they start life at a much higher absolute RevPAR level than almost all their competition. So when you look at absolute growth in RevPAR, not relative percentage growth, they're performing just fine. They're just starting in some of these cases over 120% market share to begin with, competing against a lot of brands that are a lot lower than that. So it is a mathematic – sort of, a math thing. There's also honestly some oil patch issues, if you look at those brands. In the first quarter, you saw a little bit better performance in the oil patch than you did in the second quarter, a little bit more impact again in the oil patches, which are not just a couple of places. And those brands would be disproportionately a little bit more hit by that. And then probably last, again it's sort of a combo platter of all these things. In the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter really, it was driven by a lot of leisure strength. Just given what was going on with the shift in the 4th of July and the Easter holidays meant that it was much more leisure-dependent. And some of those brands, particularly like a Hilton Garden Inn in its segment is not as much a leisure brand as it is business travel, serving business travelers. So in an environment where it's heavy leisure orientation because of those holiday shifts and otherwise, it will have some impact on the performance. So, again, those brands are – each of those that you're looking at are category killers. If you went out and talked to the development community, they lead their respective segments, or are way above any of the competition. And so I think, they're performing, they're performing just fine. Q2 a bunch of things, as I just described, sort of, causing it.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: On the credit, morning. On the credit card program, can you remind us if you can what will ultimately drive the growth in the fees from this going forward? Is that the number of members signing up for it? Is it the usage? The profitability? And did that change versus the prior agreement?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's a little, it's – you're going to get tired of hearing me say this, I guess, but it's a little bit everything. It's – if you think about the system that we had before, we had a dual-branded system. We had two major providers. It meant that it was far from optimized in terms of spend. We think there's a huge amount of upside in getting not only more people in, but honestly, just incremental spend in the system. And that's going to drive a lot of it. Obviously, the margins that we can't get into in detail for reasons of our agreements with Amex, but we negotiated better margins, obviously that benefit license fees, that obviously predominantly benefits the system. The largest part of the economic benefit of this transaction is going back into the system in a whole bunch of different ways that benefit customers and that benefit our ownership community. But it's all, it's a combo of those. We're going to get people – more people in. They're going to spend more. And we've got a better margin in our negotiations with Amex.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then changing gears a bit. We've seen more press releases on the changes to the cancellation policies from some of your peers. And I know you've been testing various things there. Where are you in fine-tuning the cancellation policy? And how do you think about the potential financial ramifications?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. You obviously saw it because it became public that we went to a 48-hour policy that will get instituted – that will get rolled out next week. We announced it to our owners a month ago. And in select markets, 10 or 20 markets around the country, we'll go to 72 hours where we think it's appropriate. The reasons I think are obvious for why we're doing that. Not just because of new technologies, but just because customers, many of them, ultimately have been trained to do multiple bookings and do things that have created a scenario where cancellations have, in some markets, skyrocketed. They've got, they've gone way up. And it makes it – it's not good for anybody. It makes it very hard for us to manage inventory, particularly close-in inventory in a way that makes sense. And the net result of that is it costs everybody, because if we can't manage inventory, there is ultimately a cost to that, that at some point gets borne by the consumer. And so the idea is we got to be able to understand what people want to do a little bit earlier, a little bit closer in. We have – we can't have it be within 24 hours, just because we can't manage that last minute inventory. It's just not – it's very difficult to do. And so that's why we're doing it. We've had generally talked to a lot of our corporate customers and otherwise, and I think, people understand it. The reception has been perfectly fine. We are, to your comment, testing some other things. I'm not going to get into it in detail because we're deep in the middle of it. But hopefully sometime in the second half of the year we will layer some incremental opportunities on top of that, that would really start to bifurcate. Then really thinking about from the 48 hour, 72-hour mark out to seven days, creating fully flexible pricing structures and semi-flexible pricing structures that would require potentially even cancel seven days, within seven days. Again, with the effort being to be able to manage inventory more intelligently, what we find as we're testing it is the large majority of our customers actually do know within those time frames whether they need to cancel or not. It's just they haven't had to do anything about it. So they haven't. But if you can create the right incentive system where you give them an incentive to let you know earlier, it's good for them because they ultimately probably can get a little bit better deal. It's much better for us because we can manage that close-in inventory more intelligently to make sure that we both price it right, but more importantly, we fill as much as we can and don't leave rooms unoccupied.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: That's helpful. Thanks so much. I'll jump back in the queue.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. Chris, in your prepared remarks, you talked about your RevPAR index increasing 60 basis points in the quarter, and increased every – in every brand in every region. I was just hoping if you could reconcile that with your U.S. RevPAR results. Your RevPAR growth in the quarter was in line with – was in line with upper upscale and upscale industry growth, and I know you're in other segments. But if you were just kind of looking at it kind of just not having the deep information that you would have, it might have been a little bit difficult to assume that you did grow RevPAR index in the quarter.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Right. I think, it gets down, Felicia, to the weighting. In the second quarter, if you look at where our brands are focused, it's not as much in leisure proportionately as some of the other brands that were driving the more significant increases in the star data. So, again, when you sort of weight it, it's comparable, but where we're getting more lift is in the brand. The brands that have more leisure orientation were driving more of the star result, and we're just not as present or present at all like in the economy segment as an example.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Helpful. And so – and you've been pretty clear about the success of Hampton, but can you just get maybe a little bit more granular where you might be seeing some pleasant surprises in your RevPAR index improvement?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, I think, the pleasant surprise I covered, and you did a nice job of covering it again, so thank you. Which is all of our segments went up, all of our geographies saw market share gains, which is important. Hampton, you know, I've said this many times before, I'm sure some would debate, I think, it is probably the most – objectively the most successful hotel brand in the world if you just look at market share, which it not just leads its category, it annihilates the competition at over 120% average market share. If you look at customer satisfaction scores, which we see. If you look at the demand from the development community here and around the world. You know, Hampton is one of the wonderful gifts that keeps giving. But we have lots of those gifts, I mean, if you go across the portfolio of brands. One of the things that I've said many times, and certainly on a couple of prior calls which is as a consequence of a very much a focus on this approach is we want all of our brands to lead or be category killers in their segments. We do not want brands that are substandard because we don't want our customers playing a game of Russian roulette where, you know, some of the brands that they stay with are good and some of them aren't. So it's why we've chosen a path to be very focused on organic growth, both our existing brands, but also as we add new brands because we really feel like we can develop those brands in a way that really resonate from our product and service point of view with customers, better than taking on other problems. So Hampton is one example, there are many of them. The good news story, as I say is, all of our brands are – have market share premiums, some more than others. On average 114%, which is the highest as far as I know in the industry, and I think there is more upside potential, but they're doing well, and we continue to focus on moving the needle, and have had good success doing that.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. And then just to switch gears for a second, there's been – obviously there's been a lot of focus on U.S. RevPAR. But just switching to international which did beat our expectations by a bit. I'm just wondering, and I don't even know if you can look at it this way, but how early are we in the cycle in Europe and Asia Pacific? And do you think we could see a few years of growth at these levels? And what customer segments are driving growth in those regions?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hey, Felicia, it's Kevin. I'll take this one. I think, it's hard to say exactly where we are in the cycle. I think, Europe in terms of its economic cycle is behind where the U.S. has been and they're doing things like quantitative easing, and they have a lot of things to figure out whether it be around Brexit or otherwise that's driving a lot of business activity. Exactly where we are in the cycle, who knows? I think, for a large – for the most part, our international markets are driven by transient. Growth has been very steady in all regions, and it's sort of coming from everywhere. And so there's no reason to think that we can't continue to grow RevPAR in those markets for a while, and how long, who knows?
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great. Thanks. You answered a lot of the questions. I guess, maybe just one to clarify the credit card branding fees. The guidance you gave about the basis point increase on the growth rate and all of that, can you just sort of help us ballpark? Is that like $60 million incremental to next year? And maybe it's just because part of it ended up falling in this year after all. So how much should we think about being the incremental from the credit card, the new agreement, on an annualized basis what that adds versus the old agreement?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good question, Robin. I think, that again there are limits on what we're – we've given you what we can give you. I think, if you're good with math, if you back into it, I think, you can get pretty close to the number. I mean, we're saying 200 basis points essentially on our overall fee base. I mean, that's a simple way to look at it. So take your model times 2%.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: But, I guess, I'm also trying to think about some of that falling in 2017, some of it doesn't start till January of 2018. So, the...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: We're giving you the incremental for 2018 in that number. Whatever is in 2017, we've baked into what we've – it's relatively modest, and we've baked that into the guidance we've given you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Right.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: So, maybe it's $60 million...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: So the 200 basis points, it's baked into the 11%.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: The 11% factors for the catch-up.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: 200 basis points. The 200 basis points is incremental.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: So the $60 million is incremental, but the total credit card range may be higher than that because that's maybe some of the 2017 increase that you bumped up today, right? So combining those to get to an annual? Is that the right way to think about it?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'm not – maybe you take it offline with Chris and the team. I think, there's a modest amount of it in 2017. The bigger increment is going into 2018, and we've given you pretty much the number, 2%. So that's as far as we can go.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning. Just a first-off question, Chris. If I could follow up on Harry's question, it sounds like you feel, I guess, I'll say old fashioned, cyclical supply and demand is the main reason behind the stubborn re-acceleration in RevPAR. But could secular factors be the culprit here? Like maybe just continuing penetration of pricing transparency that fuels a new level of, I guess, I'll call it corporate frugality? Do you think there's some other factors that might be driving this?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I don't think so in a significant way. Again, I always want to be completely intellectually honest. You can't say when you sit where I sit that when the factors you just described, transparency – or heaven forbid I talk about the other things I know that are on your mind for fear of going into the black hole of Airbnb, but that some of those things don't have some impact. But here's the thing, Jeff. Nothing that we're looking at suggests any of those things are having a material impact. It really is the economy. It really is that you've got growth, but it's fairly anemic broader growth. And you have an environment sadly where nobody can get along here in my hometown, and it creates caution. I've said it a bunch of times. When I was at NYU, I think, I said it on stage or somewhere, but there's sort of caution flags out. If you're a business and thinking about hiring, spending, plant, equipment, it's not that they're not doing it. They are. It's just, I think, there's a little bit of caution in the air, and so they're holding back a bit. Which is, again, why – we're seeing growth. It's positive. Business transient is positive. It can be more positive, I think, if people felt they had a little more certainty around what was going to happen with some of these big things that are swirling about legislatively. And I think that's it more than anything. As I look at the data, as I talk to customers, I think the air of the – the balloon has just not got a lot of compression in it, or as much compression as we would like. And that's a little bit of a lack of confidence within that community.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And just a question on maybe the outlook for distribution costs. And hopefully Kevin can maybe help you stay out of the black hole of Airbnb on this. Some of the OTAs have been emphasizing home rental business maybe as a way to thwart – like a flanking maneuver, if you will, by Airbnb that, out of fear they evolve into an OTA. Do you have a view on what can happen between the OTAs and home rental? And ultimately, do you think that's a battle? I guess, where I'm going is, do you think that's a battle that has a beneficial outcome for hotels? Maybe lower distribution costs?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes. You know I'm usually very long-winded. I think, the answer is yes. Here is the thing. Competition is a good thing. And there being more competition in the home-sharing business and more – by the way, you know my fundamental belief, it's just a different travel occasion, trip occasion. We are not directly competitive with what they're doing. So more competition, I think is good there. More competition – them morphing in whatever ways to feeling more like an OTA is a good – whether they do that or not, I don't know, not for me to say. But the more competition there is in any space, the better off we are, I think, because more competition in theory would help have the impact of driving pricing down and distribution costs down. So I view that as a long game. Lots is going to go on over the next 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years. But as the competitive environment heats up, I think, the net result is good.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Can you give us a breakdown of monthly RevPAR in the U.S. in the quarter? And sorry for such a myopic question. But I think, the concern is June RevPAR slowed versus May, despite getting the July 4th benefit. And so – and that kind of coincided with some issues in and on the Hill or in D.C. So maybe there's just been a slowdown in demand.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hold on a second. You're getting very granular. So June was, in the U.S., up about a point. July in the U.S. up – would be adjusted up a bit. Thomas, why don't we get the data and we'll maybe get back with you.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I mean, I guess did anything stand out to you?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: What's the question you're trying to get at? I don't want to use the call to get into monthly data, all right?
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: No. No. No. Exactly. So the question is, did it feel like, as we went through the quarter and into July, that because of kind of the headlines that were coming out of D.C. with the lack of healthcare reform playing out, and maybe some other – with the issues in Russia or with Russia...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, that...
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Did it feel like those impacted the math?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's a better question. Not to pick on you. That's a better question. So the answer is, yeah. I mean, July is an odd month both because there's all the swirl in the air, which is clearly not helping. But it also started out with a bang with 4th of July week basically being a non – the whole week was off travel, particularly business travel, which is the largest part of our system. So, again, I think when you holiday adjust it, it's a different story. Or day of the week adjust the holiday, it's a different story. But July, July is going to be weak. Now, August, as we look at the data going into August, it reverses that trend. August is back, our expectation is and with the business we have on the books, is both August and then September when you cleanse it for the Jewish holidays, back on track. So a large part of what's going on in July, the best data we have was kicking off with a really bad week that people didn't travel. And then going into the next week they were in summer mode. And that made it a painful start to July. So I don't see between May, June, July, August, if I put it all together, I don't think there's any real trend in July. When we get through August – obviously we haven't gotten through August. But with what's on the books, I think we'll find that August was back on track.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. And then I saw a press release out, I think it was this week, that you're going to do a Hilton Garden Inn refresh. Can you just talk about the thought process behind that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, we're constantly looking at every one of these brands, as I've talked a little bit about it before, both our new brands, but our existing brands to make sure that both from a product service point of view, profitability point of view, they resonate with customers, and with owners. And so this is the next turn of the wheel for Garden Inn and just coming up with the next iteration of design that makes sure that it appeals to customers. A bunch of changes, you know, modest changes in the rooms. Bunch of changes in approach to the public spaces and food and beverage, that gets rolled out over a pretty extended period of time, that ultimately we think is going to be better for customers, and will drive greater profitability. More efficient to build, more efficient to operate, more revenue generating opportunities in the public spaces. So I think, this is sort of business as usual for us. I mean, we do, you know, sometimes they get headlines, it's funny when they do. Sometimes they don't. But we're – all of our existing brands are in a constant state of motion in terms of trying to figure out how to make sure that they remain relevant.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC: So sorry to beat a dead horse here on demand trends, but earlier in the year you had suggested that if some of the early trends continue, you could be at the high end of the RevPAR range. I know now you're saying the forecast would suggest the midpoint of the range. Am I reading too much into that comment? Or has demand softened because of some of these D.C. issues that you talked about? And is that entirely attributed to business transient, or have you seen changes in the leisure and group side as well?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. I think in the main what I'd say is – what I tried to say, hopefully, I did say it this way on earlier calls, that if we had a 1% to 3% range, you should always assume when we give a range that our forecast is somewhere around the middle of it. We try and be very disciplined about that. I think what I was trying to indicate is if we do get – I had some optimism, as did many, that if we do get some of this legislative stuff going, that it would unlock a little bit more optimism in the business community, which would drive hiring, spending, investment, et cetera, that I thought could translate on a lag into the business, and could propel us above the midpoint or somewhere between the midpoint to high point. As I sit here today and I sort of covered in my prepared comments, it's not that I don't think that that can happen. I'm still sort of hopeful that eventually we are going to get to tax reform and we're going to get past healthcare and some of the noise that's out there. The difference between now and then is we're more than halfway through the year. We all know that if these things happen, the trickle through to benefit us is on a lag, and given we're halfway through the year and they haven't done it, and they're getting ready to go on summer recess, it just stands to reason that by the time, if they get it done, they do get it done, we're not going to have enough time for it to trickle through and really benefit this year. So that puts us in the midpoint of our guidance and plus or minus that's where we've been. I would say, over the last couple quarters our forecasting has been within 20 bps of the midpoint one way or another. So, I would say our forecasting hasn't changed materially. My view of it of getting any of that incremental benefit this year has just because the year is running out on us. Now, hopefully things happen towards the end of the year, tax reform and otherwise, and that will give us some opportunities next year. But it just seems, I would say, just realism setting in where we are in the year suggests it's a little bit harder to make that assumption right now.
Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will be from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hi, good morning, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Bill.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Chris, I wanted to limit my focus on Chinese investors and they've been in the news quite a bit. I'm not sure how much you can tell me about what you're hearing from HNA and their future plans, and their stake in your company. But also Anbang and the Waldorf in New York, if you can give us an update there. You said you're going to open a new luxury hotel. I didn't know if that might be the new flagship Waldorf. And kind of what's happening to your fee income from the Waldorf that I think at one point was thought to be as much as $10 million a year. What's happening while the hotel is closed?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And I thought that it was odd that I might make it to this call and not talk about our Chinese partners. So, Bill, thank you for making sure we got to that.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: You're welcome.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I am three minutes out, and I almost got through, no. Hey. So here's the thing. Obviously both Anbang and HNA have been in the press along with some other major Chinese conglomerates lately, and we've obviously had discussions with both groups. I think as it relates to HNA, I don't have a lot to add to what you're reading about in the sense that we continue to have a dialogue with them. We continue to work on the things that I have described in the past to you, and we continue to work on the process of onboarding a couple of board members, all as planned. And what happens with them? Ultimately, obviously, I don't know, but it appears to us sort of business as usual. And so I don't think that there's anything much more to say about that. I'm happy to answer any other sort of questions on that. On Anbang, we've had lots of discussion with those guys. As far as we know, their intentions are to continue at a rapid pace to enter into the major redevelopment of the Waldorf later this year. We continue to work on all the design and planning, and the intention is later this fall we'll get into the heavy demolition. And it will probably be, honestly, three years of work when that starts to get it up and operating. So as far as we know, they are moving forward. In every conversation that we've had with them, they have suggested that to be the case. So time will tell. As it relates to our fees, I think I can tell you. I mean we disclosed it. It's a little over $7 million in fees that we earned on it last year. I think $7.3 million is what I remember, but call it $7 million, that went away this year that when it reopens we'll come back, and we think when it reopens it will be higher than what it was when it left the system, that's built into our numbers. That's already out of the numbers that we're giving you because obviously we knew the Waldorf was going to be closing. So it's been out of the numbers. In terms of the new hotel that's opening in midtown, that is not the Waldorf. It would be a miracle for them to be able to get it open by the end of the year since it's going to take about three years to renovate it. It's another deal that I had hoped that we'd be able to talk about specifically. We can't. We're very close to signing another deal that will be with – hopefully, if all gets done, it would be done with the Conrad brand, not the Waldorf brand given what we're doing with the Waldorf Astoria. And hopefully by next quarter, we'll have it at a place where we can disclose the specific assets.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Chris, two very quick follow-ups on that. Can you remind us the lockup period for the HNA investment? And then number two, to the best of your knowledge, has Anbang gotten – have they secured the financing for the redevelopment?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: On the second one, I do not know. They certainly represented to us that they have the financial capacity to do the renovation. Exactly where they're getting that money, I do not know and probably will never know, I mean, in the sense that they have a lot of resources given the size of their business. On the HNA lockup, what was the question? It's a 24-month lockup. They closed in March. So they've got, whatever, 20 months left on that lockup.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Okay.
Operator: The next question will be from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Morning.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: A big picture, cyclical type of question here. Given the trajectory of your signings and what you know about that, this cycle – where would you think the peak growth rate in openings for you will occur? And is it 2018? 2019? 2020? Where might you peg that at?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Gosh. I hope it is way out in the future. I don't know. I mean, if you look at it now in terms of openings, obviously we're picking up this year over last year. We will have a record year in construction starts this year. Over 80,000 rooms we'll start construction. So that would suggest that the peak is somewhere two or three years out, but that makes the assumption that somehow everything tails off which I think it's hard to assume at this point. If we do our job, we're going to find ways in this big world we live in to keep deploying resources and brands and following demand patterns that are different in different places of the world. It's not this year. It's not next year, just given what's going on in construction, it's probably a few years out.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you mentioned that with HNA it's really just business as usual at this point. But given the financial concerns that have been described in the press, I guess, at what point would you become more concerned about your relationship with them. And I think the shares are on margin right now, and is there some point where that could start to impact the relationship with you?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, I am always concerned. I mean, if investors are concerned, then it makes me concerned. But I'm probably less concerned not to diminish the issue, but I'm probably less concerned than investors are simply because as it relates to the strategic opportunities, we were very clear in saying that we thought that was good strategic potential. But then it wasn't like something we were building into numbers. It was just long term we thought there were a bunch of things we could do together that would be beneficial and I still think that. And it wasn't like we were counting on in our numbers this year or next year, the following year that something was going to happen. So there's no downside to that. As it relates to their share ownership, of course, I would worry about that if I thought there was something to worry about. At the moment, I don't think there's something to worry about in the sense that they bought the position. I'm going to use round numbers for $6.5 billion. The current position in three companies is worth $7.5 billion. They've margined $3 billion. So there's $4.5 billion of equity. Call me old fashioned, but that's a lot of equity and a lot of margin for error. So I guess if you said to me it was much more highly leveraged or margined then, I guess, it would stand to reason I should worry more. But given that under their loan agreements, as I understand it, and then they're publicly filed, they're capped at $3 billion. They have pledged the stock against $3 billion from four big global money center banks. I think, again, it doesn't keep me up at night. I think everything – that's why I say business as usual. They own it. They've got a lot of margin, low leverage, lot of margin. And I think strategically the things that we'll do are super long-term anyway, and we'll keep chugging along.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And can I just ask you one other quick one? You had mentioned earlier about maybe some of the supply in the U.S. potentially weighing on mid-scale and upper mid-scale. I'm just curious. Do you think this current kind of supply growth in the U.S. might peak in 2018 or do you see that continuing to build a little bit into 2019 and the out years as well?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think it likely peaks next year, maybe a little bit into the first half of 2019. Just if you look at the stats on what's going on and what's getting under construction in the U.S. I think you are past the peak in deal signings. And you are sort of approaching the peak, given that the financing environment has become more difficult for things getting under construction. And so, I'd say you're sort of subject to things sort of staying as is. You're sort of into the gestation period than of delivering what's there. Once that's done, the pipe isn't getting as full. Now the good news for us is our brands do disproportionately well because they're more financeable. We've added new brands and I think intelligently at the right time and for where we are in the cycle with Tru and Tapestry and Curio. And so, we've been able to bend the arc of the curve a bit relative to what's going on in the industry. So our growth has continued to chug along. But I think it's 2018, early 2019, all things being equal.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.

Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Thank you, Jill, and thanks everybody for joining us this morning. We're pleased to report our first quarter as the new simplified Hilton with the RevPAR growth, at the top end of our guidance range, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above expectations and with good progress on our recently announced share repurchase program. As a result of the strong start to the year, we're also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year. We continue to see tremendous momentum in unit growth as our share of global hotel development continues to increase. We opened nearly 8,000 net rooms in the quarter and we remain on track to deliver approximately 6.5% net unit growth this year, while adding over a 100,000 new signed rooms to our development pipeline. We expect 2017 to be another record year for construction starts, openings and net unit growth. Our top line performance continues to benefit from favorable fundamentals along with market share premiums driven by our industry-leading brands and commercial platform. System-wide RevPAR increased 3% in the quarter helped by the Easter calendar shift. Leisure and corporate transient both performed well and group RevPAR meaningfully outperformed our expectations. Looking forward, macroeconomic forecasts are relatively unchanged since last quarter with U.S. GDP and non-residential fixed investment expected to outpace 2016 growth rates. Modestly accelerating demand should offset forecasted supply growth, allowing us to deliver a full-year system-wide RevPAR growth in the 1% to 3% range, driven by solid group and transient performance. Group position for the year remains positive with nearly 85% of the business on the books. Turning to development, our pipeline increased 16% year-over-year to a record 2,100 hotels and 325,000 rooms. Hotel owners continue to invest in our growth at a record pace, accelerating our net unit growth. We continued to approach our growth in a strategic and discipline way with new units coming from existing brands in both new and current markets as well as organically-developed new brands targeted at incremental market segments. All brand segments are at record pipelines and the pipeline mix is similar to our installed base with balanced distribution across chain scales. As our growth is almost entirely financed by third parties, we generate substantial returns on minimal capital investment. We also generate leading returns on our owners' investments, which enables us to continue growing franchise rates. Our effective rate is currently at 4.8% system-wide and heading towards the 5.6% as contracts step up to current rates, increasing roughly 10 basis points per year. We've had great success with our new brands, which have been developed at minimal cost. We recently opened our first Tru by Hilton just 15 months after the brand launch. The property located in Oklahoma City is owned by Champion Hotels. With more than a dozen signed Trus, Champion Hotels is an incredible supporter of the Tru brand and we're thrilled to celebrate this milestone with such a great partner. We expect to open about 10 Tru hotels by year end and an additional 75 next year. There are currently 425 Trus in various stages of development, of which roughly 90% are with current Hilton owners. According to STR, Tru represents more than 30% of the U.S. industry's midscale pipeline. We also continued to get great traction on our conversion-oriented brands where deals can move quickly through our pipeline and add to unit growth in the year without increasing industry supply. Curio, our four-plus star conversion brand, continues to attract both domestic and international attention. Over the last several months, we opened our first Curio in the Middle East and signed several projects across Continental Europe. As of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 90 Curio hotels opened and in the pipeline. Our newest conversion brand, Tapestry by Hilton, sits just below Curio in the three-star category. At quarter end, we had 60 projects signed or in various stages of negotiations. Additionally, we're on track to open our first Tapestry in the second quarter, less than six months after the brand's launch. In addition to new brands, we think our existing brands have terrific upside, especially in the international markets. Last week, we opened our 100th hotel in China, up from just five hotels under a decade ago. Today, our pipeline in China totals nearly 275 hotels and 70,000 rooms driving our number one ranking in rooms under construction in the country, and 21% share of total rooms under construction in the Asia Pacific region. We celebrated a major milestone in March with the opening of the Homewood Suites, French Quarter in New Orleans, which is our 800th hotel in our all-suites brand portfolio. This segment has been a really strong performer with RevPAR Indexes over a 120, and we expect to have another 350 suite hotels open over the next two years. Marking another significant milestone, today we actually opened the Hilton Rio de Janeiro Copacabana which is our 100th hotel in Latin America. This brings our supply in the region to more than 17,000 rooms across nine brands, with another 70 projects in the pipeline and shows our continued commitment to strategically expanding our footprint, particularly in resort destinations and key international markets. We're also taking full advantage of our global scale to roll out industry-leading innovations. Guests continue to prefer our web-direct channels, which made up nearly 30% of distribution mix in the first quarter. This is our highest level ever and web-direct continues to be our fastest growing channel, increasing more than 200 basis points in distribution mix year-over-year. Our Hilton Honors app is downloaded every eight seconds and is the highest rated travel app providing unprecedented choice and control for guests. Through this app, guests can check in, download their digital key on their mobile device and head straight to their self-selected room upon arrival. By the end of this year, we expect to have digital key capability at all of our hotels in 80 major North American markets and 2,500 hotels globally. In the first quarter, Honors members accounted for 57% of occupancy, up nearly 2 points year-over- year. Additionally, paid member folio increased more than 8% as new members join the program, and existing members move up the tiers, enabling us to capture an even greater percentage of their travel wallet. We ended up the first quarter with 63 million Honors members, up 19% year-over-year. Post-spins, we're a resilient fee-driven business with a very disciplined strategy that's focused on growing market share, units, and free cash flow per share, as well as preserving our strong balance sheet and accelerating our return of capital. We estimate a 1 point change in RevPAR growth impacts our adjusted EBITDA growth by approximately 1 point, roughly the same as every 10,000 net unit adds on a stabilized basis. This year, we expect to add 50,000 to 55,000 net new rooms with great sight lines for the next couple of years, given that we have nearly 170,000 rooms currently under construction. Given the resiliency of our model, modest changes in RevPAR do not meaningfully impact our free cash flow generation potential, and we intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders. To provide more clarity, we expect to return $900 million to a $1 billion to shareholders this year with around $200 million in the form of quarterly dividends, and the full balance in share repurchases. At our core and critical to our continued success, we are a business of people serving people, and our team members strive to provide exceptional experiences at every hotel, for every guest, every time. I want to thank all of our team members for their hard work and commitment to our shared purpose to be the most hospitable company in the world. Hilton was again named one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. Our inclusion on Fortune's list is a very prestigious ranking and I think a fantastic acknowledgement of where we stand when measured against the top companies in the U.S. and around the world. This ranking is also representative of our exceptional workplace culture. Ranking at number 26 in the U.S., we increased our position by 30 places this year and we ranked number 17 globally. We're really proud of this important recognition. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin, who'll give you a little bit more details on the quarter and our outlook. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Thanks, Chris and good morning, everyone. For the quarter, system wide RevPAR grew 3% versus the prior year on a currency neutral basis, which was at the high-end of our guidance due to good transient demand and strong group performance. We estimate the Easter calendar shift boosted RevPAR growth by 70 basis points in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $424 million exceeded the high end of our guidance range, driven by better than expected fee growth, good cost control at both the corporate and property levels and one-time items. Roughly half of the beat was related to timing, and should not impact full-year forecasts. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.38, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range and increasing nearly 60% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. In the quarter, management franchise fees grew 7% versus the prior year to $429 million, well ahead of our 2% to 4% guidance range. In addition to timing-related items, outperformance was driven by greater than expected incentive management fees and franchise sales. Turning to our regional performance and outlook, we believe that our broad geographic diversity coupled with the resiliency of our fee-based model, helps mitigate the impact of regional uncertainties. Following the spins, no single market or gateway city accounts for more than 3% of our adjusted EBITDA and international travelers comprise less than 5% of our U.S. room night demand. In the U.S., comparable RevPAR increased 2.5% in the quarter, driven by strong group performance. We estimate oil and gas markets pressured growth by 10 basis points, representing a significant improvement versus the prior nine quarters. For full year 2017, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the midpoint of our 1% to 3% systemwide range. In the Americas, outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR grew 2.8% versus the prior year, due to strength in Mexico and Canada, driven by good group performance. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region at the higher end of our guidance range. RevPAR in Europe grew a strong 8.4% in the quarter, ahead of expectations due to transient strength in London and a notably strong March for Italy, Spain and the Mediterranean region. Additionally, international inbound to the UK was up nearly 20% in the first quarter, helped by favorable exchange rates and increased travel from the Middle East. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be modestly above the high end of our range. In the Middle East and Africa, RevPAR declined 2.1% in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations as supply challenges and political unrest in certain markets continue to weigh on results. Modest improvement in Egypt helped mitigate weakness. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region of flat to slightly positive. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 5.5% in the quarter, led by stronger than expected growth in China and solid performance in Japan. For full year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid-single digits, with RevPAR in China up in the 6% to 7% range. Moving onto capital allocation, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share during the quarter for a total of $50 million. Our board also authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share for the second quarter. As Chris mentioned, we initiated our stock buyback program in March and have since repurchased over 2.1 million shares for a total of $123 million. The previously announced HNA acquisition of 82.5 million Hilton shares, or a 25% equity interest from Blackstone, closed in March establishing a long-term investment in Hilton. We believe this strategic partnership will be mutually beneficial as both companies leverage their networks and relationships. Turning to our balance sheet, we successfully executed over $9 billion in financial transactions in the first quarter, including amending and extending our $4 billion of term loans, refinancing our $1.5 billion of senior notes and unwinding and replacing our interest rate swap portfolio. Collectively, these transactions lowered our cost of debt by 25 basis points, reduced our interest rate risk with roughly 75% of our debt now at fixed rates and extended our average debt maturity by approximately a year and a half. We now have no meaningful maturities for six years. For the second quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be 1% to 3% with the unfavorable calendar shift likely resulting in growth in the lower half of the range. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $490 million and $510 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of between $0.47 and $0.51. As Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3%, but are raising our adjusted EBITDA outlook to a range of $1.86 billion to $1.9 billion. We expect the return between $900 million and $1 billion to shareholders this year in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We're also raising diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to $1.73 to $1.81 for the year. Please note that our full-year EPS range does not incorporate incremental share repurchases. Further details on our first quarter results as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Certainly, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. And your first question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning, Felicia.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hello. Chris, since you last reported, last quarter were talking about some of the post-election euphoria. And since you last reported, some of that's worn off. But there's certainly been fits and starts in sentiment, particularly now as the President is trying to put through an ambitious tax plan that could be very favorable for business. So, certainly the sentiment plays a role in lodging demand. And I'm wondering have you seen group demand and business transient demand ebb and flow with different ways of sentiment or has the uncertainty regarding various administration policies caused corporate customers to sit on their hands again?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah, that's a great question, and I think one that's on everybody's mind to sort of get to the fundamentals of what's going on with demand in the business. What I would say is, breaking it apart into the two segments. First on the transient side, we've seen it in the leisure transient remained relatively healthy. We haven't seen lot of ebb and flow there, both pre and post elections. If you think about pre and post election with business transient, which had increasingly pre-election, I think, we all know become quite anemic to flattish. Post-election, we saw it step up a little bit. And we've seen it remain pretty consistent since. So, we saw a little bit of post-election bump and it's remained, I mean week by week obviously things move around, but if you have sort of cleansed the data, our read of the data is it's been relatively consistent. We haven't seen any further pickup. I think my opinion is there is potential to see further pickup. I mean, you're looking at some – while the GDP print in the first quarter was quite weak, there is certainly I think still an expectation that GDP growth, as I said in my prepared comments is going to be better this year than last year. If you look at non-residential fixed investment numbers, which have a very high correlation to demand growth in the hotel business, the fourth quarter of last year was the first quarter in a while you all saw it go positive, and the first quarter was quite positive. I mean, it's almost – it's very high single-digits. Now, if you look at the data, generally, improvement in business transient will be in a lag to that – to non-residential fixed investment numbers going up. So, I think if you look at those numbers, there's a bit of a reason for optimism. I think ultimately time will tell. I mean, it's early in the year, it's early in the Trump administration and this legislative agenda. And I think we need to see it play out. I think to see it go from a little bit of a bump post-election to see further upside, I think you have to see some things settle down. There's still a decent amount of uncertainty around certain foreign policy issues going on and the legislative agenda, health care, tax reform, infrastructure, the regulatory. I think the regulatory is pretty stable and I think people view that as quite positive. Healthcare, unclear, maybe have clarity in the short-term. Tax policy, a lot of work being done on that and a lot of thinking going on on infrastructure. So, I think as those things play out and you have a little bit more certainty, particularly if it's viewed as positive in the business community, and I would say tax reform being the most important of those, I think there is potential to see incremental increases. Again, having said that, what we're seeing is relative stability at the moment. On the group side, which we've had tons of questions about, not surprisingly there's been lot of dialogue about it over the last week or so. What I would say is we feel pretty good about the group side. I'd say if you look at system wide group performance in the first quarter, we covered it in the prepared comments, frankly it was a lot better than we thought it would be. In that, of course, you had the Easter effect which helped but we knew the Easter effect was coming. It was better even factoring for the Easter effect. If we look at the full year forecast for what we think for group at the moment, it's a bit a better than it would have been a quarter ago or two quarters ago. So, that we feel good about that. If we look at our current position, system-wide on the books we feel pretty good about it and it certainly supports what we think we need to deliver in the group side for the year. If you look at the pace numbers, which I think people have been focused on, you got to parse those really carefully because everybody sort of defines it in slightly different way. So, I would sort of break it down maybe into three categories. Pace in the quarter, in the first quarter, for the quarter – in the quarter, so very short-term group business was actually up quite nicely, okay. So that was positive. Pace in the quarter for the full year of 2017 was down marginally. That should be expected and it follows the pattern that we've seen over this recovery in the last few years, which is you'd very occupancy levels, you're lapping over high occupancy levels, you have 85% of your group business on the books and so sort of the math – the math on that is you would generally see some of the pace and position numbers decline a little bit as the year goes on. Another I think really important pace number is looking at in the quarter – in the first quarter what were bookings like for all future periods, not just this year, but into the – in the future years. And that was up pretty meaningfully. So again, I think generally support of a feeling reasonably good about group. April, we got the date on the last couple of days. Pace was up quite nicely in April, obviously the beginning of the second quarter. By the way April overall, even though you have the reverse of the Easter effect, I will say performance wise, April is better than we thought it would be. And as we look at in the 2018, 2019, the position is quite – is quite strong, so maybe more than you wanted to know, but I know a lot of questions on this. I think that we feel fine relative to the range of guidance that we've given overall, and I think group's contribution to that, I think we feel – we feel good about group for the year, and group going forward.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks. You answered like all five of my follow-up questions.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Okay.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Okay.
Operator: The next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: In the past you talked to the – good morning – you talked to the benefits of network effects for the whole company. As you look at the pipeline growth and RevPAR growth in international market, specifically, which continue to build, are you already getting the benefits of those network effects, and what are the key puts and takes to think about the pace of the international pipeline going forward?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: That's a good question, I would say. I don't think that we're fully getting the benefits of the network effect. It depends where you are in a world where – where we built out, places where we built out, broader distribution we are getting more of the benefit. But there is – none of them have been built out to the same degree as, Steve, as we have in the U.S. So, I think that there is certainly opportunity there. I mean, one gauge, I don't have the exact numbers in my head, but I'll tell you if you look at our average market share in the U.S. versus the other mega regions, the other mega regions have very good market share, and rapidly approaching the market share of the U.S., but not quite there. So I think there is still more opportunity in that regard. I think as time goes on by just by definition of the scale of our existing footprint and the size of the population centers outside the U.S. and our under-representation, I mean we're in 104 countries in the world. We are in a lot of places, but we are at the tip of our iceberg of international growth. If you just do the math that's increasingly over the next 5 years or 10 years, you're going to see our percentage growth coming from other places around the world. So we're really – I mean, we look at these market share numbers, as you can imagine every week, we visit with our teams around the world. And I have been really pleased in the last two years or three years that those market share numbers are supporting our theory of the network effect that as we're building out broader distribution in other parts of the world, that we are rapidly sort of approaching similar market share numbers. But in terms of ultimate growth potential, I think the sky is the limit. I mean, you think about the populations around the world that we can serve and you think about the layering of existing brands, let alone newer brands that we're launching. We have tremendous and I would say sort of, certainly for my lifetime, unlimited opportunity to continue to grow.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And then as a quick follow-up, where was your RevPAR index in those other markets compared to the U.S.? Are you seeing those close the gap similar to how the U.S. market has matured? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah, I mean, I said that. I think they are both on an annual basis, quarter-by-quarter moves around. I think they are both within a couple of hundred basis points of the other mega region, EMEA and APAC are within a 100 basis points, 200 basis points of the U.S. and they've been moving up materially over the last few years at a rapid pace.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: May be just to touch on a pretty specific one as it relates to the guidance. We noticed that you raised your fee guidance from 6% to 8% up to 7% to 9% it looks like for this quarter fee numbers came in much better than expected. So, number one, just what's driving the increase in guidance? And then number two, if you could, is there some room for some of those same line items to possibly continue to improve as we move throughout the year?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. Shaun, it's Kevin. The increase in the fee guidance for the year is pretty much – I think I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that about half of the beat was timing-related items, and half of the beat was just pure performance and a good chunk of that was in the fees. So, what you're seeing is kind of carrying through the beat to the full year guidance for the balance of the year. And so, of course, if we ended up – if we were to end up near the high end of the range on RevPAR over the course of the year, of course, the fee guidance could continue to go up. But that one point increment in the range is just the carry through from the first quarter beat.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: And to be specific, Kevin, just as my follow-up, it was primarily IMF and is it a initial franchise fees and anything you're seeing on that initial franchise fee line item we should know about?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: No, it was kind of broad based, right. I mean the RevPAR came in at the high end of the guidance. So, that's going to push fees to the high end and then IMF was a little bit better and then franchise sales, which is a combination of change of ownerships and new deals, was better than we thought. Some of that timing and some of it's just better than we thought. So it's pretty broad based on the fee side.
Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Thank you very much.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Sure.
Operator: The next question will be from Harry Curtis of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hey, good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: I wanted to go back to a comment that Chris made about leading returns to owners. Can you just walk through what do you think is driving that and its sustainability, is what you're doing easily – can it be easily copied by your competitors?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Certainly I don't believe it can be easily copied. I think Harry it's a complicated answer, obviously. But I think at its core it's about having better more consistent brands, which means product that is in each and every one of the brands and categories consistent service delivery that is consistent, ultimately a commercial platform that is hitting on all cylinders, all elements of sales in our res systems and revenue management and our online business and marketing and all of those things sort of coming together to drive performance. And then the other thing that it is not easily replicable is you can have really good products, really consistent service and good commercial engines, but in my humble opinion, without having a network effect, meaning having broad price point distribution as well as geographic distribution, you just by definition can't take as much of a share of wallet from customers and as a consequence you can't drive the same level of market share. So, it's all of those things, which of course I'm going to say, I run the company and we are going say that we think they're unique. We don't think – we think we are one of a very limited number of people that have a real network effect. And in terms of having the purest brand portfolio in the business, we think we got it, meaning that every one of our brands in every category is either the leader or a category killer in its segment. There is no dogs in the bunch. So when owners come to us for various needs that they have, where they are following demand patterns, whatever those might be or whatever type of product or price point, we have a great product to give them, where we're going to drive consistently market-leading market share and that's what they're investing in. They are investing in a system to drive top-line and bottom-line performance and drive the best return. I think the fact that we've been able to lead the industry in driving growth and doing it organically without having to use our balance sheet in any meaningful way, it's a pretty darn good testimonial to that. Now we have to keep doing it. So, we have to make sure that as we launch new products they're great products, that they really resonate with customers, that we have consistency and the high quality, that service delivery. I said we're a business of people serving people and we are – service delivery matters a lot. But that network effect of connecting all of those dots around geography and price point matters a whole lot and I think ultimately what we have is awfully unique.
Harry Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Thanks, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Chris, before, in your development pipeline commentary you mentioned that 52% of the pipeline is under construction which gives you pretty good visibility to net rooms growth. You also referenced in the press release that construction starts in the first quarter are up 50% or nearly 50% from year ago levels. What's driving that? Is it simply developers just wanted to get in front of interest rate moves and accelerate the financing timeline?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Those, yeah.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Or is it something else? And then--
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: No.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: ...also the 325,000 rooms in the pipeline, what percent of those projects are fully financed at this point?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: I probably can't answer the second, I'll ask Kevin to take a shot at it, but the – in terms of the first, the numbers are accurate. We're up construction starts 50%, I do not think that we will be up 50% in construction starts for the full year, okay, just to be clear. That is an accurate data point, I think for the year, it will be less than that. What's driving the first quarter and that's going to help us a lot in the year is I think that we're sort of firing on all cylinders in all segments, but the thing that really accelerated first quarter was Tru, new brand launch, lots of Trus getting under construction. It's the lowest price point we have in terms of cost per room to build, much more financeable than a lot of other products in a financing market that, is sort of stable, but got a little bit tighter, it remains a little bit tighter. So I think proportionally we're getting more of the financing dollars. The other driver of it was huge good things going on in China with limited service, particularly with our deal with Plateno, a ton of new Hamptons that went under construction in the first quarter and we're going to have a ton more coming, but my sense is, it will stabilize out that the Tru and the Hampton in China help supercharge the first quarter a bit. In terms of the 325,000 in the pipeline, it will be under construction, certainly half of it – that would be financed, half of it's under construction, so it's financed. So I would say somewhere around the order of 60% to 70% because there is a 10% or 20% and I'm sort of guesstimating that would be on the verge of getting under construction or probably committed, so conservatively I'd probably say 60%.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. I think that's probably right, Joe. It's hard to have perfect visibility. And the other thing to think about is, I think, most of the focused-service projects particularly in the U.S., they may not be technically fully financed, but they'll get financed, because most of the folks who are building those are repeat developers, they've really strong relationships with their regional banks. And at the end of the day, if it's a viable project, they're going to get it financed. But I think Chris' guess is pretty good, but it's hard to have full visibility into that.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. Thank you, guys.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everyone. Thanks and good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Chris, you spoke a little bit about business transient trends and kind of what you saw pre-election, post-election. And if we go back to when you guys spoke in February on your 4Q earnings call, I think one of the comments that you made was, if you can get business transient in that 1% to 2% range, that would maybe lead to the higher end of your 1% to 3% guidance range for the year. Could you maybe comment on how things have shaped up since then and kind of where you're tracking relative to those metrics?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: That's a good question. I'd say we're probably tracking in that zone. There is no ways week-to-week and month-to-month, but I'd say we're in the 1% to 2% zone and as we were sitting around every Monday morning, and I started with EC call with all of our senior folks from around the world, I did it yesterday like I do every Monday and we go through the performance in every major regions of the world. And I'd say there's generally a level – a decent level of optimism in all of our – from all of our folks coming out of April where if we look at all of the regions I think everybody felt like April was trending better and as they go into May and June, they're feeling reasonably good. So, to get to the higher level of range, I'd say right now and we gave you 2 point range in outcome because it's early in the year, okay. And I think that's the prudent thing to do. If you put me on the spot a little bit, where – if I had to refine that more or where do I think it'll be, honestly what I see right now real time in talking to our teams and looking at the data, I would say we'd be at the mid to the high point. That's what forecasting, current forecasting would suggest. Now, there is a lot to play out in the year. There is a lot going on. We talked about legislative agenda, foreign policy. There is lot out there. But we've got – it's not roaring, but we got pretty good stability in the range of outcome that we talk about and business transient, leisure transient hanging in there and I gave you a long soliloquy on group that makes me feel with our position in group for the rest of this year reasonably good that it's going to deliver what we want to deliver there. So yeah, we're in that zone and I will say we feel good about delivering or suggesting we're going to deliver.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And if I may, just a quick follow-up. Obviously you guys have the dividend in place, offering about 1% yield now. When you think about 2018 and growth in the business, how are you thinking about the trajectory of the dividend and maybe what kind of benchmarks are you using in terms of thoughts to grow it?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. I mean, we're really sort of in the 20% or 25% of free cash flow. So, as the free cash flow goes up, I think there could be some modest increases in the dividend. I would guide you to not expect that this year. I mean, I think we're going to be stable with where we are. But there we'll be potential in future years as free cash flow goes up. I mean, we – as you probably gathered from our commentary, we're a lot more focused on returning capital in the form of buybacks. We obviously want to have a dividend, we want yield investors to be able to invest in the stock. But in terms of driving great, sort of market leading total returns to shareholders over a long period of time, we think being relatively modest on the dividend side and much more robust as robust as we can on the buyback side is going to lead to the best long-term returns.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Good morning, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Just maybe the first part of the question, Chris, I'm just curious and I know that politicians have thrown out some new tax plans. I'm just curious how potential the new tax policy affects your thinking on capital allocation and leverage. I recognize it's a little bit of wait-and-see, but I just wasn't sure what might be kind of in your thoughts.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. It is definitely a little bit early, and it's wait-and-see. I mean they've thrown some things out there, and we've had some pretty good discussions with folks that are on the point on this to get a bit of a sense of what's going on behind the scenes. I think they're darn serious about getting something done, and I would not at all be surprised if when we finish this year it is something done or something is pretty well baked in getting done. I think from my point of view, whatever they're going to do – all of the options that we're looking at I think are going to be good for our business. I think now it could turn out a different way but certainly everything that's sort of being fancied about, the net result for us is positive, meaning that it's going to ultimately drive more free cash flow. And so it doesn't really change in any way our capital allocation policy, it just may change the amount of capital that we have to allocate, meaning if taxes go down, free cash flow goes up. Our belief is and our strategy will be to return all of that cash flow back to shareholders too again largely in the form of incremental buyback. So, I think same plan, just may have – if they get something good done, we'll have more to play with.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: And then just a follow-up. I mean setting asides for these macroeconomic drivers like non-residential fixed investment for a moment, what are some of the positive and negative considerations from the operatings out of the industry that are really shaping your outlook? Is that the pricing pressure from supply maybe offset some of the strong pipeline deliveries you have or do you see an ability to renegotiate with OTA? I was kind of curious of what bubbles up from the industry itself that really drives your view on Hilton?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Well, I mean, that's a complicated question and I am not exactly sure there is a succinct way of answering and I think it's sort of a combo platter of everything. I mean, our model now as we've talked about is pretty simplified, I mean, it's really focused on continuing to do everything we can with our brands, and our commercial strategies to drive share. So we drive unit growth, and if we do those two things and outperform, we're going to drive incremental cash flow, which we're going to give back to shareholders. And so, there are a whole bunch of things sort of bubbling around the industry that are going to contribute to that, whether that be on OTA renegotiations over time, which will obviously continue to take place, whether that be finding other distribution partners that are very efficient distribution partners, that allow us to have access to new customer bases. Importantly, our direct strategies, which we've talked a lot about over the last couple of years, and are going to be strategies that go far into the future, this evolution of Honors and having it be a real club that everybody wants to be a member of has a real value for both frequent and infrequent travelers, there is a huge amount of opportunity still left there to continue to take, what, 30% online business and grow it to a much higher share of our business. So, there are multitude of things that we're going to do. On the commercial side, there are multitude of things that we're going to continue to do with our existing brands to make sure they continue to be relevant. New brands, which we've talked about, we've launched one this year, we've got four more in the skunkworks which obviously will help us deliver from a Hilton point of view incremental growth, but importantly it's going to help us further that network effect that I talked about to give us an opportunity to serve you and more of our existing customers, bring new customers into the fold. So, there is a bunch of company specific, industry related things that we're going to do, but it's – again I can go on for a long time, it's a complex strategy, but the ultimate goal and sort of the holy grail is share, you know, it's all of those things are – so that we can drive incremental share to drive incremental profitability to owners, so they want to continue to invest tens of billions of dollars in our system.
Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: It's helpful. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Search. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You talked about some timing [Technical Difficulty] (46:25.).
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: We can't... (46:30.)
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Your line is breaking up unfortunately.
Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC: I'm sorry. Can you hear me better now?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Unfortunately, no.
Operator: I'm sorry, sir your line is breaking up. I need to move on to the next question and that will be from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. I wanted to just follow-up on the development question, I'm just wondering, have guys seen any change in the willingness of local lenders to finance developments just from, say, versus a year ago? Do you think that's getting easier or harder to bring a new property to market?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: I think on the margin it's stable. I think throughout the second half of last year and maybe a little bit of this year, but really second half of last year, it became incrementally. The market became a little tighter, a little harder, terms were a little tougher, the loan-to-values were a little lower, pricing a little higher, all of those things. My sense in talking to our development teams and lots of owners is that it's relatively stable. Certainly I would say relatively stable for the owners that are very good borrowers that have been out doing this as a part of their business over an extended period of time. So from the last quarter, not any material change.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick – it's a small question, but your Conrad hotels showed a RevPAR decline in the quarter driven by 5% decline in rates. And I was just wondering if there were something in particular there that was going on, that was maybe seasonal or regional?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Those – just a couple of individual hotels, it means it's not that many hotels. So a couple of individual hotels that had just off group pace for the quarter and a couple off-group pace (48:18).
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: For the full year, the numbers are fine. But yeah, this is small enough system where you have a couple of hotels have a huge impact.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. Just in terms of your major...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning, Tom.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Your major corporate customers, were there any industry verticals that really stood out in terms of underperforming or outperforming?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Not really. In preparation for the group – the call, I'm going through our quarter-end numbers, I had our sales folks in here ask them the very same question. Nothing really stood out. They said it's been generally consistent as between industries. I mean, maybe with the energy sector being the exception where you're starting to see a little bit of outperformance relative to where it's been given what's going on in the energy sector, but otherwise pretty consistent.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. And then, China, any more granularity about what are the strength in that quarter and what raised – drove you to raise your guidance for that segment or country? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Well, we've raised guidance a little bit for the year because we performed at 10% for the quarter. We are just seeing part of it is hotels ramping up more strongly, part of it is the economy is holding in in China and maybe a little bit of overlapping of some of the constraints that were going on last year in China.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Sure.
Operator: The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great. So, two follow ups from something you discussed earlier. First is when you talked about the pace of group in the year, I wonder if you could comment on how rate trended during Q1 for forward periods? And I have one other follow up.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: I don't have that data. My recollection, they can look for it, my recollection is that was up modestly.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. And then the other revenue lines, and you gave a lot of color that was helpful on kind of incentive management fees and franchise fees. The other revenue line was up about $20 million which is lot of maybe with the close to the dollar amount of EBITDA beat. I wonder if you could give a little bit of color on what was in the other revenue line that was....
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yes. Some of the-Robin, some of the one – I mentioned I think – I did mention that half of the beat was one-time items and they were just a couple of – sorry, timing items and a couple of timing items were in that other fee category that just shows up in other revenues. So, that's why you saw that spread there and that will normalize over the course of the year.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. Is it the same color on what some of the items might have been?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: I don't want to get into specifics, so just a couple of random things we can talk a little bit more about, specifics if you want offline.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Sure. Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thanks. Sticking with a geography question regarding your performance in Europe which was up 8%, stronger than we had thought and I believe the segment accounts for 12% of your EBITDA, so it is fairly important. Your guidance of slightly above the 1% to 3%, could you elaborate, just a little bit in terms of why you expect to see the deceleration? Is that just a factor of comps or maybe just being a little cautious there? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Sorry, Chad, what region are you talking about?
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Europe.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. Maybe, I think, Europe was obviously particularly strong in the first quarter. We're expecting some of that to normalize over the course of the year. We still think it will above the high end and that's just pretty much all that went into that.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, regarding the buybacks, could you help us think about programmatic versus opportunistic and how the April buybacks kind of fit into that thesis? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. I think we've tried to be abundantly clear on what we intend to do this year at this point, $900 million to $1 billion total minus $200 million in dividends. So, $700 million to $800 million of buybacks, all of which we're doing essentially programmatically. The course we're on we just I think began the program on March 8, because we had to get the approvals from our board of directors, and all those things that you guys saw. So, I think where if you were to look at what we did in the month of April, March and April combined, I think we're on a trajectory to sort of be in that range and if we're not, we'll will obviously adjust the range. A large part of that period of time was under a plan that we couldn't alter because we were in a quiet period. So, it was clicking along based on a predetermined grid. We can obviously now post-earnings adjust that grid and we will if appropriate to get to the numbers that we've talked about.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yes.
Operator: The next question will be from David Beckel of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks so much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about international trends inbound into the U.S. It's been a while since the couple of failed attempts to enact any sort of travel ban by the administration. Has that caused any sort of pullback in corporate or group activities that you've seen?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: If you look at the broader trend, interestingly last year international revenues – revenues from international arrivals was down about 3%. So it was off for a host of reasons. I'd say last year predominantly the strength of the dollar, maybe a little bit what was going on post election, but there wasn't a whole lot of year left post election, so I think it was predominantly dollar. If you look at it in the first quarter, which is obviously at this point the only data that we have, revenues from international inbound business was actually up a little bit, I mean not a lot, I mean it's sort of flat to up 1% and it-- but it's not consistent from the various places around the world. But if you look at the – you break the world apart, it was up from Canada and up from Asia Pacific. It was down from Mexico and down from the Middle East. I think in part related to some of the things that are going on politically, the net of which was – it was up a little bit. I think where the dollar is today, and some of the other things that are going on, our expectation is for this full year that you're going to see international business down a little bit, maybe sort of circa notwithstanding was up in the first quarter, maybe circa where it was in – where it was for the last year. Now, a lot of things can play out and change – change that outcome, strengthening or weakening of the dollar. The dollar has sort of backed up a little bit, which is helping. Now, we're getting ancillary benefit. Europe now is a decent chunk of our business, and arrivals with the weakening of the pound over time, and these are the things that are going on. You've seen that-- part of the reason you're seeing Europe surge and have such strength and why it's an expectation of being performance wise above the high end of our guidance ranges. So, we do pick some of the back up over there now. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, it's about 5% of our system wide business. So, it's moving, obviously being positive is always better, but these are the types of movements that we're talking about don't have a material impact on the bottom line result, and certainly don't have any material impact on our ability to drive cash flow.
David James Beckel - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Very helpful. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will come from Michael Bellisario of Baird. Please go ahead.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: We haven't touched on the credit card yet, which sounds like it could be a nice catalyst. Could you provide an update on where you stand with those negotiations? And then, how we should maybe think about the potential upside to earnings if and when that deal gets inked?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. I think we talked about it a little bit on the last call, and the update is that we are still in our process. We went out and we did an RFP. I think the good news is we're nearing the end of that process. I am hopeful that we're actually going to be able to get it done in the second quarter. We're in fairly advanced stages of negotiation, so I'm not going to be able to give you any sense of where it's going to end up, because we're not done. I will say at a high level, I think it's going to be very good for everybody involved, meaning I think it's going to be great for our customers, because we're going to create a customer value proposition that's far better than what we have today, which I think ultimately is good for them, and will help us drive incremental share. It's going to be great for our overall system in terms of driving more business into the system, and it's going to be great for us in the sense of driving more fees from that segment of our business. I know you'd like to know what it is, but it's not done, and so I'm going to stop there, and when we get it done, we'll give you a little bit better sense of it.
Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Perfect. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Chris, I was looking at the...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Good morning, Bill.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: ... I was looking at the – good morning – the Lodging Econometrics report last week on the U.S. pipelines, and what struck me was that your, I think it's 1,250 or so hotels that are in the pipeline, so few of those are traditional full service Conrad, Waldorf, the Hilton...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: You are talking about the U.S.?
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I'm sorry – U.S., yes, U.S.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Okay.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And I'm – what I'm wondering is, how do you think about the aging stock of traditional full service hotels, whether that opens the door for more nontraditional competition and how that may shift your fee income over a longer-term basis as you're more dependent upon select-service hotels than you are full service hotels going forward?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. I think if you look-- Bill, it's a great question. If you look at our pipeline and compare to any of the major competitors, so you look at the overall numbers across the entire U.S. system, you're seeing the bulk of the development go on in a limited-service space. There is a real simple reason for it. You and I, and I think everybody knows it. And that's – that is – that's where the demand growth is, that's where the economics work and that's why owners are investing money to build new properties in those segments because they're getting the returns there. And when you look at the costs to build and to operate and cost to build new construction for full service and luxury, it works in a few places, but it doesn't work in many. I mean, we have – we have a bunch of stuff going on. I think we have more luxury stuff going on in the U.S. than anybody. We just opened Conrad in Chicago, we're getting to go under construction in DC, the Waldorf Beverly Hills is going to open next month. I mean, if you add up we get going out in the U.S. in luxury, probably – I think more than anybody, upper upscale, we are doing great relative to our competitive set. There're just not a lot of it going on because it's not justified because construction costs continue to go up throughout the Great – after the Great Recession and through now in a way where it makes it in most markets quite difficult. Having said that, in terms of our existing stock of hotels, we're very focused and have been on making sure that we're keeping those up to snuff. So in the end, while we're are not – this development cycle doesn't involve a ton of-- of upper upscale and luxury, for us or anybody by the way, it doesn't mean that we're not cycling through and being very thoughtful about the existing products we have whether that'd be DoubleTree, Hilton, Embassy or above and making sure that we're doing everything we need to do to make sure that the product is relevant and that it ultimately can be competitive. And so I feel great about what we've been doing in the capital investment side with our owners because particularly now post-spin, this is not -- we are not the owner of anything in the U.S. market, but if you go around and look at what's opening, you go around and look at what we're refurbishing around the country, I feel really good about, but this is – this is a phenomena that's driven by underlying economics. And I'm not going to say that at same point you're eventually going to get back in the full service and luxury development at a larger scale. I don't know if it's in this cycle though because I don't see economics that on a wholesale basis are going to support it for some time. And again selectively it's being supported because we're obviously doing some of it, and so are our competitors, but wholesale, I think the game is in limited service, and I think that's an important nuance to our model because I know there's noise out in the market from competitors and the like – I think in the end our model is a capital-light model and ultimately we're trying to serve customers and the way we serve customers is giving the products they want, in the locations they want it with service delivery that is in keeping with the particular price point that they're – that they're willing to pay for. And given that we're not investing, we're investing – it's third parties that's investing this capital. What we're doing around the world is following demand patterns and the capital is following that demand pattern. And so in the U.S. that means a lot of limited service. By the way, around the world that means a lot of limited service. It doesn't mean that we're not going to do tons of luxury, and upper upscale and all those things, it just means that, with a growing middle class around the world, a huge amount in the next 5 years or 10 years or 20 years of demand growth is going to be in the mid-market. And by the way, I'm very proud to say we are really happy to serve the mid-market, particularly given that every time we add one, it's a 100% margin and an infinite yield. So, the more we do, the more money we make. And the more money you make and the better we serve our customers and the greater network effect that we create. Again, that's not to say we're not going to do tons of Hiltons and Embassys and DoubleTrees and Conrads and Waldorfs. We're going to do those too when the economic rationale supports it and we can deliver for owners' returns commensurate with their investment.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great answer. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI: Hi. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Just two quick follow-ups on the capital return side. First of all, in terms of repurchases and not being included in EPS guidance for the year, is there a technical reason for that since we kind of sort of already know, what the number is going to be?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Yeah. It's just – Rich, it's just a standard that we've decided to take. You don't know at what price you're going to buyback. So why guess the share count going forward. There is nothing more to it than that.
Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI: All right. Clear enough. Thanks, Kevin. And then a second one on back to the dividend policy question. To the extent tax reform does happen and the rates on dividend income change. Would that in theory potentially change your dividend policy or would you seek to kind of keep the payout roughly the same and the balance with buybacks as you...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: I think the idea is we'll keep it roughly the same, unless something really radical happens. I would never say never, we want to be intelligent depending on what happens in the world. But based on everything, we are hearing that is possible in terms of outcome, it would not change our philosophy on the dividend.
Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI: All right. Thanks, Chris. That's all I got.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: You bet.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc: Thanks, everybody, again for joining us this morning. It's great to be in our new simplified model reporting here in the first quarter and I think it was really solid results. We appreciate the time and attention and all the great questions and look forward to catching up with you after the second quarter. Take care.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Hilton Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2016 Results Conference Call. Please also note that today's event is being recorded. At this time, I like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Jill Slattery, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.
Jill Slattery - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jamie. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today.

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide details on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Jill, and good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning for the call. We're pleased to report our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results with RevPAR growth, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all in line with our expectations. We're also very happy with our continued momentum in the development side of the business. With the spins of Park and HGV successfully completed last month, this will be the last quarter we report as legacy Hilton Holdco, as each company will be hosting separate calls to discuss their results and outlook. As we talked about during our Investor Day in December, the new Hilton is a resilient fee-driven business. Our two primary drivers are same-store growth and net unit growth, and we are far less sensitive to changes in RevPAR, given the lower operating leverage of a more simplified model and the resiliency of our unit growth. Focusing on results, same-store trends remained largely consistent throughout 2016. When adjusting for calendar shifts and other one-time items, system-wide RevPAR growth was essentially 1.5% to 2% throughout the year, led by group and leisure in the 2% to 3% range and business transient at around 1%. In the fourth quarter, when you adjust for the impact of calendar shifts, Hurricane Matthew and the U.S. election, performance improved versus the third quarter, which was driven primarily by an uptick in corporate business. January performance also came in slightly above our expectations. The bulk of our room night demand has short lead times and tends to follow macroeconomic indicators on a lag. Forecasts for these indicators, particularly U.S. GDP and non-residential fixed investment growth show modest year-over-year acceleration into 2017. Actually, in the fourth quarter, non-residential fixed investment posted its first quarter of positive year-over-year growth since 2015 and is forecasted to strengthen further into 2017, which should lead the growth in demand for room nights. Where we have more visibility, notably in group and corporate negotiated business, we see continued demand growth. Group position for the full year is up slightly versus 2016, with approximately 75% of the business on the books. While January is a relatively light booking month, we did see positive momentum, indicating a stronger pace for the year. Additionally both group ADR and corporate negotiated rates are up 2% to 3% versus 2016. Turning to unit growth, where we have good sight lines, we continue to take market share, with construction financing slightly more expensive and marginally harder to get in 2016, only top projects with strong brands got done, keeping industry supply growth below the 30-year average at just shy of 1.6%. It remains to be seen whether the lending environment gets better, but one thing is certain, our industry-leading brands continue to take a disproportionate share of development activity globally with little use of our capital. For Hilton, 2016 was another record year for signings, for openings and construction starts. We maintained our position as the fastest growing global hospitality company on an organic basis, increasing our system size by 6.6% with 52,000 gross rooms opened. We opened roughly one property per day in 2016 and started construction on nearly 77,000 rooms. We signed a record 106,000 rooms bringing our pipeline to 310,000 rooms, with over half of that pipeline under construction. Globally, more than one in five hotel rooms under construction are being developed as a Hilton brand, which is 4.5 times our existing share of global rooms. Additionally, four of Hilton's brands are in the top five brands in the industry under construction globally. Our five new brands continue to contribute meaningfully to both our supply and pipeline growth. New brands now represent nearly 800 hotels and 90,000 rooms that are either open or in our pipeline. Home2 recently opened its 135th property, with another 350 in the pipeline and is now the second largest brand underdevelopment in the United States according to Star. Tru by Hilton just celebrated its first birthday, with nearly 400 hotels representing 37,000 rooms in various stages of development. According to Star, Tru represents over a quarter of the U.S. industry's midscale pipeline and accounted for 65% of the total growth in the U.S. mid-scale pipeline in 2016. We're on track to open our first Tru hotel in the second quarter and expect to have nearly a 1,000 rooms open by the end of the year. Last month, we launched our newest brand the Tapestry Collection by Hilton. This conversion-oriented brand positioned in the 3-star to 4-star space just below Curio is off to a strong start, with over 40 deals in progress. We expect the first Tapestry to open later this year, and believe this brand has significant growth opportunities with an addressable market of over 15,000 existing hotels globally. We also had great success in deploying our existing brands into new markets. In 2016, we expanded our system footprint across five new countries for a total of a 104 countries and territories. Last week, for example, we signed our 100th Hampton in China with our partner Plateno. For the full year 2017, we expect net unit growth of 50,000 rooms to 55,000 rooms, or approximately 6.5% system growth, supported almost entirely by third-party capital. We also forecast another year of robust signings totaling over 100,000 rooms. While our scale, size and industry-leading brands and commercial platform continue to drive strong unit growth, similar attributes are also driving tremendous growth in our loyalty program. Hilton Honors added 9 million members last year, bringing total memberships to over 60 million members. For the full year, Honors members drove 56% of system occupancy, representing a year-over-year increase of nearly 400 basis points. By ensuring that all of our customers get the best value and the best experience through Hilton Honors, they are much more likely to have a direct relationship with us. Our digital channels, including website and mobile bookings continue to outpace other channels on share growth, up more than 200 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, web-direct as a share of all bookings was nearly 30%. We also launched a number of enhancements to our loyalty program just last month that we believe will make the value proposition even greater for our members. Hilton Honors is the first loyalty program that will allow members to choose exactly how many Points to combine with cash for a hotel stay through a Points & Money slider. Members will also be able to use their Points for purchases on Amazon.com and to allow family and friends to pool their Points for free. We believe these enhancements will continue to make Honors the most customer-centric loyalty program, driving incremental value for guests and the overall system. Lastly turning to capital return, our new simplified business model with growth almost entirely financed with third-party capital, should continue to generate meaningful free cash flow. We intend to be very disciplined in returning capital to shareholders over time largely through share repurchases. We're meeting with our board of directors next week to finalize our plans and expect to provide further details shortly thereafter. In closing, I'd like to extend a really heartfelt thank you to the Hilton team, as well as the teams at Park and HGV for the successful completion of the spins. As you might guess, breaking up a 100-year-old company is a massive undertaking. We owe the success of this spins to the hard work and dedication of team members across all three companies, and we remain very excited for the prospects of all three companies going forward. With that, I'm now going to turn the call over to Kevin to give you a little bit more detail on the quarter and the full year results. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks Chris, and good morning everyone. For the full-year, system wide RevPAR grew 1.8% near the high-end of our expectations with rate gains driving performance. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.975 billion was in line with the midpoint of our guidance range, supported by roughly 100 basis points of margin expansion. Diluted EPS adjusted for special items was $2.68. Before adjusting for the Reverse Stock Split, diluted EPS was $0.89. In the fourth quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 0.9% versus prior year, which was at the high-end of our guidance due to better than expected transient demand in November and December. Good cost control at the corporate level somewhat tempered by softer than expected ownership margins drove adjusted EBITDA of $751 million, achieving the midpoint of guidance. In the quarter, we took a $513 million non-cash tax charge related to a corporate restructuring that was executed before the spinoff. The charge primarily relates to the transfer of certain intellectual property to a foreign subsidiary. For book purposes, the expected taxes on the future earnings of the IP are recognized in the quarter. Diluted EPS adjusted for special items was $0.70 in the fourth quarter or $0.23, excluding the impact of the reverse split. Transient business grew modestly in the quarter, partially driven by better corporate performance, additionally increased demand from Hilton Honors members supported year-over-year growth. System-wide group RevPAR was roughly flat in the quarter as declines in convention business offset modest upticks in smaller leisure-oriented group demand. Calendar shifts, challenging year-over-year comparisons and softer city-wide in key markets weighed on demand, while rates increased in the low single-digit range. In the quarter, management and franchise fees grew 2% year-over-year to $436 million. Excluding unfavorable FX and other significant one-time items, fee growth in the quarter would have been approximately 360 basis points higher. For the full year, management and franchise fees increased nearly 6%. Turning to our regional performance and outlook. In the U.S. comparable RevPAR increased 80 basis points in the quarter. Underlying corporate transient trends showed more positive performance sequentially. However, results were masked by unfavorable calendar shifts, Hurricane Matthew and continued weakness in oil and gas markets. Excluding the drag from oil and gas markets, we estimate U.S. RevPAR would have increased an incremental 60 basis points. Performance in the quarter was supported by an uptick in Hilton Honors driven volume and the post election boost in corporate transient. For the full year, RevPAR increased 1.8%, largely driven by good group and leisure transient business. For full year 2017, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth towards the midpoint of our 1% to 3% system-wide range. In the Americas, outside the U.S., fourth quarter RevPAR grew 2.5% versus the prior year due to strength in Canada where RevPAR increased more than 5% driven by solid group performance. Zika concerns continued to hinder growth in the Caribbean, while economic contraction continued to drive declines in Brazil. For the full-year, RevPAR increased 4.2%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be at the higher end of our guidance range. RevPAR in Europe grew 2.2% in the quarter, surpassing expectations due to solid leisure transient performance across the UK and Ireland during the holiday period. Additionally, results in Continental Europe were aided by increased demand from the Middle East and easier year-over-year comps, as we lapped terror attacks in Israel. Unfortunately, terror attacks and geopolitical instability continued to plague Turkey, where performance declined 16% versus the prior year. For full-year 2016, RevPAR for the European region increased 1.1%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth to be at the mid to high-end of our range. RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa declined 5.7% in the quarter, driven by new supply in the UAE, coupled with lower demand levels. Continued political unrest in certain African markets further weighed on results. In 2016, RevPAR in the region decreased 1.5%. For full-year 2017, our RevPAR growth forecast is flat to slightly positive. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased 1.5% in the quarter, largely due to strength in China, mitigating softer group performance in Japan and demand declines in Thailand following the death of the King. RevPAR growth in China increased approximately 5% during the quarter, driven by the China national holiday campaign and the China winter campaign, which helps compensate for shortfalls from the recent implementation of nationwide service charges. For the full-year, RevPAR growth in the Asia Pacific region increased 3.5%. For full-year 2017, we expect RevPAR growth in the mid single-digits, with RevPAR in China up in the 3% to 4% range. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, before adjusting for the Reverse Stock Split, bringing our full-year cash dividends to $277 million. As Chris mentioned, we are meeting with our board next week to discuss our capital return strategy, including recurring dividends and the initiation of programmatic share repurchases. For the first quarter of 2017, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be 1% to 3%. We expect adjusted EBITDA of $380 million to $400 million and diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $0.24 to $0.29. We are maintaining our full-year 2017 RevPAR growth guidance of 1% to 3% and expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.835 billion to $1.885 billion, including an FX headwind of approximately $30 million. Taking into account cash on hand and anticipated working capital needs, we expect to have between $900 million and $1 billion in cash available for capital return this year through dividends, share buybacks and potential debt prepayments. We expect diluted EPS, adjusted for special items, of $1.65 to $1.75. Please note that our full-year EPS range does not incorporate any assumptions on share repurchases. Further details on our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as our latest guidance ranges can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks, and we'd now like to open the line for any questions you may have. Please note that we will be focusing our comments on the pro forma Hilton business, leaving commentary on the Park and HGV businesses to their management teams. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Jamie, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: Our first question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hi, good morning and congratulations on...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Shaun.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: On completing the spin-offs. So, maybe I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the outlook. Chris, the last quarter, it seemed like the outlook was fairly dependent on some pretty big macro assumptions. And so, I guess the question for you is, number one, do you feel a little bit more secure in that outlook today than you did where we were sitting a quarter ago? And number two, any green shoots you can mention that you're seeing specifically to the hotel business and what you're seeing on the transient side specifically, since that's where we saw a lot of the softness last year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, a great question. I assumed, one way or another, we're going to talk about that probably on multiple questions. It would be hard to say I don't feel a bit better than I felt when we originally gave our 1% to 3% guidance. And that would be because that did have an expectation that we would see a pick-up in key macro indicators, including GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment. I think we have started to see that, and I noted it in the – in my prepared comments that non-residential fixed investment turned positive in the fourth quarter for the first time in a while. That is the highest correlation that we can find to growth in demand for hotel rooms. I think there is a fairly high level of expectation generally out there that you're going to see positive non-residential fixed investment this year and that GDP growth is not picking up in a significant way, but picking up at least modestly. And so, I think when we gave guidance of 1% to 3%, we felt reasonably good about it at the time based on where we were in budgets. As we now have a little bit of the year behind us, we have a few green shoots that are essentially that the corporate business, the business transient business has, as I said, picked up a bit post-election. It's continued into the first part of this year. We feel like we've got a decent group base on the books. Leisure has maintained its relative strength. So, it would be hard to say that I don't feel a bit better about our 1% to 3% than I did when we gave it to you last fall and that the opportunity to be at the midpoint or above would be higher today than it was at that time. Having said all that, it's early in the year. There is a lot going on. If you watch cable news and read the newspapers and some of the things that have created the positive sentiment, I think, in the business community relate to the idea of tax reform, regulatory reform, the possibility for infrastructure spend. And well, I think there is decent momentum on a number of those things. In the end, what will matter is what actually happens. So, I think the psychology in the business community is more positive than it was certainly when we talked last time. How positive it gets, how long it stays positive is entirely dependent on what actually happens on some of the things that I just mentioned that are swirling. But we feel like – what we're seeing right now makes us feel like the guidance we've given is a darn good guidance. And when we look at what we've delivered so far this year, and we've already had an opportunity to work with our teams to re-forecast the year based on what they're seeing in activity, short-term plus the longer term group business, we feel pretty good about it.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Great. Thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It looks like your RevPAR and fee growth guidance in 2017 has a bit of a widening gap between the growth rates. Can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes driving that shift, whether it's FX, unit growth, accelerating mix shift, et cetera?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Maybe I'm not sure I understand the question exactly, Stephen. Can you give me more?
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: So, I guess if we look at the RevPAR guidance, it's pretty consistent throughout the year, but yet you have fee growth accelerating for the year versus first quarter?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, got you. Got you. On a quarter-to-quarter basis – maybe Kevin will jump in with a little bit more detail. I think the way to think about that is two things that are going on that sort of create the anomalies on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Some of it's FX. Some of it's one-time items either that are happening this year or happened last year. If you'd cleanse it for those things, it actually is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then, maybe one other follow-up just on the better corporate transient. Perhaps I missed this. But were there specific industries where you're seeing this recovery or do you feel like it's more broad based?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think we're seeing it very broad based. In fact, I was talking to our folks that lead our sales efforts about that very question earlier in the week, and I think we're seeing very broad based – more positive sentiment across a broad range of industries.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. I'll jump back in the queue. Best of luck.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And our next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi, good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Patrick Scholes. How are you doing, Patrick?
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: I'm doing all right. Thank you. Just a couple of questions here. Can you drill down a little bit on your group revenue position as it relates to the first half of this year versus the back half of the year and how are you trending for 2018?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We're sort of in the low to mid-single digits for the full-year with the first half of the year up more meaningfully than the second half of the year. That is not atypical in most years as we come into the year, just given the timeline. So, a lot of the in-the-year for-the-year business obviously, when we get to this point, is going to be in the second half of the year. So, we feel – again, talking to our sales teams, we feel pretty good about it. If you look at where we ended up last year in group consumed revenue, we ended up in the 2%, maybe a little bit better. I think we're on track to do at least that. I wouldn't want to get too optimistic and say it's a ton better, given we're up 2.5% or 3% in terms of position on the books. But we feel pretty good about the first half of the year stronger, but we have – we still have plenty of time for infill in the second half of the year for in-the-year for-the-year. And as I said, that would be fairly typically how it would weight out.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And for next year, where do you stand?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Next year, obviously, a much lower percentage of room nights on the books. I want to say if we're at 75% now for this year, we may be at 20%, in the 20s for next year, but up materially. I'd say as we look at it today, Kevin, correct me if I'm wrong, we're up in the 5% to 10% range. I think towards the higher end of that range for next year at this point, but again to be balanced about it.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's right.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: There's only 25%-ish of the room nights on the books at this point, which again would be fairly typical being a year out.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Okay. And just lastly, shifting gears a bit, are you or Kevin predisposed to – when you're thinking about capital returns or debt payments, you're predisposed to any of the various combinations, whether share repurchases, dividends, debt, et cetera?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. We've been, I think, pretty clear on this in the past including at our Analyst Day in December. But maybe to make sure that we have perfect clarity, I'll do it again. I think when we think about – and first of all, as Kevin and I both said, we're going to meet with our board next week. So, everything I'm going to say is our philosophical approach, subject to our board agreeing with that philosophical approach. Obviously, we've had discussions prior to next week about how we might approach it, but next week we're going to consider it. I do expect we will walk out of our meeting next week with an approval for a programmatic approach to how we're going to return capital. The way that we've talked about in the past and the way I'd say it again today is that there is a programmatic and an opportunistic component to how we intend to return capital. The programmatic element of it is that we would look at our recurring free cash flow, and to use – the numbers for this year is roughly $800-plus-kind-of-million, and we would look at taking a large component of that – let's use a number to say 75% of that, that would come back in the form of a modest dividend, not unlike what we had been doing pre-spin. But the bulk of it then would be coming back in the form of share repurchases in a programmatic way. Then the remaining amount of that free cash flow and any other opportunities that we would have, including re-levering, as we described at Analyst Day, we would view as opportunistic. And so, we kind of put it in those two buckets. The programmatic, you will start to see very, very soon. The opportunistic, I hate to say it this way, but we'll know it when we see it. And we want to make sure that we have the capacity when there are opportunities that present themselves to be able to lean in and do something even more significant at those times.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Very good. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Kevin, while we're talking about the capital return, I did have a question on the guidance that you announced today. It was just a little bit lighter than we had expected, given your three-year view. So, I was just wondering if it's more a function of what you think your free cash flow is this year or is there anything more mechanical like from the spin or balance sheet requirements that might limit you a bit more this year than in the later two years of your three-year plan?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, Felicia, there's nothing mechanical there. And I think we did give you a three-year model that was cumulative and we understand we didn't break it down at the Investor Day. But our free cash flow for this year is consistent with what we thought at the time, and the free cash flow per year, as the earnings of the company grow, grows throughout the time period. So, there's nothing else going on there.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. And Chris, can you just comment on the recent news flow about the impact of the administration's travel ban on lodging? I know that only about – I think it's 5% of your domestic business comes from international demand. But I was just wondering more broadly if you could comment.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. That's a good question, and obviously, one that we've been fielding in lots of different forums. I'd say, as you pointed out, the international business system-wide in the U.S. is a relatively modest component of our business. If you look at what we saw in the international business last year, it was down a bit in revenue. I think it was down 2.5% to 2.8% I think but 2.5% to 3%. That was obviously pre-travel ban. That had a lot to do with the strengthening of the dollar in my mind. You did see some markets continuing to show very good growth, mostly Asia Pacific to the U.S. But a lot of the other markets, including Canada close by, we saw drop off. As we think about this year, my sense is, and then I'll answer the question specifically, my sense is you're going to continue to see pressure on international business, and I think that pressure is largely going to be driven by even further strengthening of the dollar. If you look at what's happened over the last 90 days, the dollar has strengthened a lot. That is not good for international inbound business. So, I think you'll see continued impact. On the other side, the good news is, part of the reason the dollar is strengthening, at least at the moment, is a belief the U.S. economy is going to be stronger. U.S. economy being stronger in-the-U.S. for-the-U.S., where we have 95% of our business coming from that net-net is a win for us in the industry. As it relates to the travel ban, we've been tracking it as carefully as we can. We have not seen any material impact as a consequence of what's happened over the last two or three weeks. We obviously will keep watching it and keep an eye on it, but nothing in anyway material that's come from it at this point.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, helpful. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, thanks everyone and good morning. Just on the RevPAR cadence, Chris, Kevin, you guys guided the first quarter 1% to 3%. Clearly, a little bit of benefit there and then a little bit of headwind coming in the 2Q with the calendar shift. Could you guys maybe quantify how you're thinking about that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Kevin may want to jump in. The truth is with the Easter shift, we tried not to get too tricky in the guidance and keep it consistent, because it's early in the year. The truth is that first quarter is likely to be more to the higher end, second quarter probably more to the mid to the lower end just because of the shift in Easter. I guess in the end, we could have tried to be a little more precise, but it is – we think both quarters are within those ranges and we tried to keep it simple. But Easter is going to help first quarter, it's going to hurt second quarter, moving from April – moving into April from March.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Correct, but all should be captured within the range.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. And then, just in terms of the FX headwind, Kevin, I think you said $30 million in 2017 was built into the adjusted EBITDA guidance?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's right.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Could you possibly parse that just between the leased assets and the management and franchise fees?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Just because of the breakdown in the earnings as a business, it's more of an impact to the fee business. So, you have a larger impact in the fee business, smaller in the leased business, and then a bit of a benefit in corporate expense, because we have some offset by spend in that part of the world.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Is it close to pro rata, if you just looked at it on a company-wide basis?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, I'd say it's probably two-thirds, one-third...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's right.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: If I had to approximate it.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's right.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Two-thirds in the fee...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, so it's not. Yeah. If that breaks down to 90/10, you probably go to two-thirds in the fee segment and one-third in the ownership segment.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Helpful. Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Greff from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Chris, you talked about this I guess in a couple of different ways. But when you think about 2017 across the four quarters, can you talk about what's baked into your assumptions for the pace of business transient growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think what's baked into our assumptions is that we're going to see, throughout the year, we're going to go from last year, where it was circa 1% to – if we wanted to get to the mid to the higher end of the ranges, we're obviously always trying to do is get the best performance we can. I think it's more 1% to 2% than 1%. As I said, I think group is going to perform in a consistent way. We don't see any leisure issues at the moment. Now, there's lots of things that could happen. But at the moment, we think leisure keeps clicking around – or keeps clicking along. So, I think if you get – if you can get business transient up over the 1% and 1.5%, 2%, I think it's what could lead you to being in midpoint or hopefully higher than the midpoint of the range. And I think that's possible and that's sort of what we've been seeing, if you look at – if you cleanse December and January of noise, that's sort of where we've been, is 1.5% to 2% on business transient. The only caution – again, that's all great and I know I'm sort of guiding to the mid or high in those comments. The only caution is it's very early in the year, okay, and January is not the biggest business transient travel month, nor is December. They're amongst the weakest business transient travel months we have. So, I'm not trying to be negative, just trying to be objective. We need more time to – we need more time to sort of play out and we need to be able to – as we get into February, really March, April, you get into the meatier travel season for business transient, we need to sort of track those trends and see if they continue. But again, if business psychology is more positive generally, it stands to reason and fixed – non-residential fixed investments going up stands to reason it should. Now, I talked about a correlation, non-residential fixed investment, it being the highest correlation to growth in demand for hotel rooms. It's generally on a two-quarter lag. When you go back and you really look at it over time, the first time it turn positive is fourth quarter. If you were going to be really precise, you would say you would start to see some of the benefit of that flow-through in the second quarter of this year. So, we're going to be watching the second quarter really carefully like – well, we watch every quarter really carefully, but particularly carefully to see if you're starting to see the flow in the business transient side as a consequence of capital investment going up around the country.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Okay. And thank you for that, Chris. And just one question going back to maybe close the loop on the topic of capital return, if we were to assume the board approves the authorization, there's no other issue or impediment for buybacks to start, there's ostensibly no need to further pay down debt or anything else?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Nope. No, we – our intention, subject to our board approval, is that we will start a buyback program in the very, very near future.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great. And then, Kevin, are there any incremental spin-related costs that hit the 1Q that should be – that we should be mindful of?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: We – for the most part, we've accrued for them. So, I don't know if you're asking from a cash perspective or a GAAP perspective. For the...
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: From a cash perspective, yes.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: From a cash perspective, we still have expenses to pay, yes.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: But Joe, we – as you'll see, if you look at our year-end balance sheet, we got a lot of cash...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: So, we basically stockpiled all the cash to pay all that.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's right.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: And so, what would – how would you quantify that incremental cash expenditure related to the spin then here in 1Q?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: We had – we said about $250 million in total. I don't have the exact number in front of me, but I guess it's about half.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think with all the one-times – yeah, there's a couple of hundred...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, yeah.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: $200 million or $300 million of all of the one-time stuff.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It's been accrued, but we – and the cash is sitting there ready to pay it.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Great, thanks. Just looking at where net unit growth came in, in Q4, it was towards the low-end of your guidance. I'm just wondering if that was openings that sort of slipped into Q1 or were there more removals than you were expecting. And then, your 2017 net unit growth guidance didn't change. So, if it was openings that slipped from Q4 into 2017, did kind of a similar number of 2017 openings slip into 2018 just to keep 2017 kind of unchanged?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Here, the answer on the first part is there were a few openings that just carried over to the first quarter and there were a few relatively big hotels – we had a large hotel in Cairo, one in New York and another in Rio that we had expected in the fourth quarter, and just for a whole bunch of different reasons, it will be the first quarter. If you added those in, we'd be above the midpoint or right at the midpoint, so just very modest timing differences. The reason we didn't make any changes in the guidance to this year is exactly what I think you implied in the question is just we've given a 5,000-room range and we just didn't feel like the movement – that movement alone suggest that we should change our range, because you can have, as you pointed out, the same thing happen. It's always touch-and-go when you're opening a hotel a day. I wish I could say that it actually worked, that it was one a day and it was that sort of balance throughout the year. It doesn't end up working that way. We generally, like a lot of folks, a lot of our developers are crushing it to get things done at the year-end. There is a lot of moving parts at the year-end every year. So, yeah, our expectation is some of that will flow over again, but a 5,000-room range sort of picked up what we thought the expected outcome would be.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay. No, great. I understood. And then, the other question – and maybe you've kind of answered this. But your fee revenue guidance for the year being up 7% is not as high as your unit growth plus RevPAR growth combined would kind of suggest. Is the difference – it sounds like FX would be maybe 100 basis points. Is there anything else that's making...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. There are two real simple things, FX which is a little bit more than that, if you – I think if you do the math, and then the Waldorf. The Waldorf Astoria is – in the end, it's a wonderful story, but we sold it for $2 billion and then we got – we're going to have a 100-year management contract, but it's getting ready to close on March 1. And as a consequence, until it reopens – and when it reopens, we'll get great fees. It'll be better than what we've been receiving. But while it's closed, we will not be receiving fees. So, it's FX and the Waldorf – there are lots of little nuance things. It's a big business. But if you factor for those things, that's really what's driving it.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC: Okay, great. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey, good morning. So, factoring in...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Thomas.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. So, factoring in the fact that about 90% of your EBITDA comes from management and franchise fees, and within that, about 90% of that comes from base management fees and franchise fees. So, IMFs and owned segment are relatively small. But can you just help us think about if there are any kind of unique drivers of those two businesses or nuances we should think about for 2017? Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. No, I don't think there's any – the drivers are different, Thomas. Obviously, one thing to think about in the ownership segment that's predominantly leased hotels, right, so there's a fair amount of operating leverage there. And so, when you get – RevPAR at different levels and how it mixes between occupancy and rate can have an effect on profitability. And IMF, most of our IMF, as we've described, is driven by a percentage of GOP. So, we have less volatility in that segment – in that piece of our fee stream than others might have. It doesn't really go switch on, switch off. But it still has operating leverage baked into it, because it's driven on GOP. So, that's the primary difference is, the 90%, as we've described, it's 90% top-line, 10% bottom line. So, you have sort of plus or minus 20% of the business that is driven on bottom line hotel results.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: If you look at IMF, Thomas, year-over-year and you cleanse it of FX, it's relatively comparable. It's in the high single-digits, and that's what – as we suggested at our Analyst Day, that's sort of what we expect generally over the – at least the three-year analysis period that we gave you. And then again, that's because that's a pretty good growth rate, but you know a little bit lower growth rate than you might see with others simply because it's a much lower beta fee stream, because it's not sitting behind owner priorities. So, that's where it is. Now, FX, I would say because most of it, 80% of our IMF, so 80% of that 10% of fees, if you will, is international, it gets more hit by FX. So, the high single-digits gets whacked more proportionally than the other fee base, because it is disproportionately more international, where we have the strength of the dollar impacting it.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thanks. And then, just a couple of questions on China. What are you seeing in terms of new development and overall trends in the market there? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. The overall trends remain pretty good. We ended up, for the year last year, in the mid single-digits in same-store growth. I think we're thinking similar this year, maybe a tick below, as they continue to transition their economy, but still feel like we're going have pretty decent positive same-store growth this year in China. On the new unit side, we continue to pick up steam. We opened 20% more hotel rooms in 2016 than we did in 2015, we think it'll be another 10% or 20% then again higher in terms of our NUG, net unit growth on a rooms basis in 2017 over 2016. And so we're making good headway. I think that the pivot we made a few years ago was a really important pivot. We've talked about it for a few years. We anticipated it ahead of I think a lot of others, and that was that in the end a lot of the growth like most markets around the world as they start to become a little bit more mature as the hotel market comes in the mid-market because that's where you have the middle-class population growth that is at a very high rate, the midmarket product is what they can afford, and that ultimately ends up driving a lot of the growth. So, as been well-chronicled, we pivoted very hard about three years ago to start to build out our infrastructure, retool our products on both Garden Inn and Hampton, including doing the joint venture with Plateno in anticipation of that, and that's exactly what's happening. So every year that's gone by over the last bunch of years, we've seen more unit growth for our brands in that market. The composition of that unit growth has changed dramatically. We're now – if you look at next year, meaning this year, you'll see the majority or at least probably 50/50 of our openings will be between focused service and full service and above, where it used to be essentially a 100% full service and above. So that pivot has been incredibly important, and I think impactful as an enabler to continue to keep our growth moving in a very positive direction there.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital. Please go ahead with your question.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Hey, good morning, everyone. Looking at that business transient travel forecast of 1.5% to 2%, can you provide some context of what that level was for, call it, 2014 and the front half of 2015?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Much higher. By the way, I would restate the question, if I can? It wasn't really a forecast that I was giving for the record. I was saying, what would we have to see – what have seen more recently, and what would we have to see for the full year to see that we'd be at the middle or upper end of our ranges. We don't know what the forecast transient business is, so short nature. That's what we have seen in a very short low-volume period of time, and we hope that continues. If you go back to 2014 and 2015, those numbers were probably in the 5% to 7% – if you went to 2014, I would say they were – and Kevin help me, I think they were like 5% to 7% and I'd say in 2015, they were 4% to 6%. They were moving up at a much higher clip, much more positive growth. So getting to 1.5% to 2% relative to that is not meteoric growth. I think if business sentiment stays positive, if people think the economy is going to be stronger, and they ultimately are hiring more people, and investing more in plant and equipment and technology, I think that's very much possible. I don't think that's a hope certificate. But those things has to continue and it's early in the year, and it's early in new administration, and there are a lot of swirling winds out there. We need to just see where it goes.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Hopefully the six-year high in CEO confidence translates into more investment. Looking at Tapestry...
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It certainly should logically, I mean, and it is, if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, it is.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then looking at Tapestry, do you have any internal goal that you would like to share with us as far as signings for the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. No.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: We have goals that we set out for every brand with our development teams and we obviously set up our comp systems around those. But for a whole lot of competitive reasons, we're not going to get into disclosing those.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. Fair enough. And congrats on a good year. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hey, thanks. Appreciate it.
Operator: And our next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Hi, Smedes.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. You mentioned in your opening remarks a very strong growth in the Hilton Honors program. And as I recall, and you might have to remind us some of the context here a bit, prior to our IPO, you were able to monetize that program, I believe with American Express and at least one other credit card company or bank. Isn't there an opportunity coming up now that you would be able to monetize that again? Are you eligible to do that or can you maybe talk about that a little bit?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. What we did pre-IPO was we did a pre-sale of points, a number of companies do this across the travel industry, both in hotel, airline business, et cetera. That was a three-year forward sale and that is largely complete at this point. So, yes, that is a lever that we always have with all of our – at this point, we have two co-brand relationships with Citi, Visa and with Amex and that is something that is available to us. Whether we do that or not, I won't comment on.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And the amount there prior was something like $600 million. Is that about what it was?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's about right. Yeah, $650 million to be exact. Obviously, the system is bigger now and the size of the system is a direct sort of impact on the size of Points, because the bigger the system, the more the Points that they need to have to service their customer base with the co-brand card.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then just one more extra. You mentioned the $30 million headwind from FX, is that assuming – and I'm sorry, if you mentioned this, is that assuming a constant dollar or does that assume continued appreciation in the dollar as we move through the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It assumes the...
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: ...forward curve.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: ...forecast for the dollar against the basket of currencies and it does assume further appreciation, Smedes.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. In your opening remarks you mentioned that oil and gas continued to be a headwind, I think, you said 80 basis points. I'm not sure if that was sequentially or year-over-year. Could you just provide some more color in terms of if you are seeing an improvement sequentially? And then, also, how you're thinking about this from an impact standpoint in your 2017 guidance? Thanks.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure, Chad. Some of those markets are – it depends on the market, but some of those markets are not yet recovering, and part of that is supply driven, where the markets got so strong that it brought on some supply in places like Houston and Austin. So we're not yet seeing that recovery mostly because of supply. We do assume that it does get a little bit better over the course of the year just because it lapsed comps. And then the other thing that's going on is, as oil approaches $60 a barrel, and if it eclipsed $60 a barrel, you'll start to see more economic activity in that business. But part of that is it gets caught up in what Chris was talking about before, where if activity picks up there then you'll see corporate transient pickup, and you might see that could be a factor that causes us to get a little bit more positive about corporate transient.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. And the oil and gas getting back into heavy production mode is on a lag.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Right.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I mean, once it gets to, breaks the $60 barrel, some of it can start pretty quickly, but it takes more investment and there is a lag effect.
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Right. So that wouldn't be a lot of that – there wouldn't be a lot of that baked in.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: There's not a lot of that baked into our guidance for this year. The benefit of very much easier comps is obviously baked in.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up, just because we're a couple of weeks after the ALIS Conference. Chris, was there any dramatic, I guess, difference in terms of what you're expecting your partners and REIT owners in terms of how they were viewing the world after you had conversations with them and how they view 2017 versus maybe how you and some of the C-corps view it?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. I think not to be too short on the answer, I didn't see any real difference in our view and their view. I think the broader view coming out of ALIS, I think was, I would describe – probably it's used too frequently but, cautious optimism. There's still a lot of – as I said, a lot of things in play, but I think most of the folks I talked to in our ownership community, and I talked to a ton of them there, and I talk to a ton of them on a regular basis, our feeling, I think broadly in the industry with our owner community and the REIT community are feeling a little bit better about 2017 than they did a few months ago. And as I said, I think time will tell, but my general sense is a bit more optimism.
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead with your question.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Hi. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Harry.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Chris, I wanted to focus on the longer-term picture. Now that you've separated from the two other businesses, are there – or what are the – and any new strategies or enhancements to existing strategies that you're now able to pursue to drive shareholder value over the next three to five years, it's very broad question, but if you want to take an opportunity to really focus on the primary drivers? And then fold into that your thoughts on, how the relationship might work with HNA once that closes?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure. The first one, I don't know with the limits of time, I should be careful, because I am longwinded as everybody knows. But I would say, there is no real change in our strategy for the core business. I think having spun the other two businesses, it changes the nature of the business from the standpoint of how the investment community would look at it, it certainly changes the beta of the business in the sense that now, the remaining business is really the fee business, that's a much more resilient business with embedded growth as a consequence of the pipeline that we have and that is growing. So our strategy had been and continues to be to make sure that we have the best brand portfolio in the business that as we add brands that we do it in a sensible way to better serve our customers that we drive terrific commercial performance across new and existing brands in a way that drives premium market share, and that that premium market share is ultimately driving a disproportionate share of the investment capital to our brands from the ownership community because they are going to make more money dealing with us. And that disproportionate investment from the ownership community is ultimately going to drive unit growth and bottom-line growth. And we know in the new world order of New Hilton that – while obviously the higher same-store growth is the better it is for us, the new unit growth is a much more significant component and contributor to our overall growth. And so, we had been focused in that way, and I think trying to do our best to optimize that opportunity, we will continue to focus on that, again making sure that our existing brands maintain their relevance and gain relevance, gain market share, that new brands that we launch organically are relevant to what customers needs, and ultimately all of our brands drive performance for owners. And if we do that, I think you're going to see our market share continue to grow, and I think you're going to continue to see us take share globally on the development side, and that's going to deliver a fabulous result over time. When paired with now new part of the strategy, a different return of capital story, which is in a world where we had other businesses that were much more capital intensive and a lot of our capital was going towards that or deleveraging, we did not have the kind of capital available that we do today to return to shareholders. So when you take the fundamental business that's performing I think exceptionally well and if we do our job, it'll only get better from a growth point of view. You match it with now very little and capital needs and very significant free cash flow and a very disciplined approach from myself and the rest of our team to returning that capital over time, I think it drives a fabulous result. As a result of having spun the companies in addition to having a cleaner more resilient lower beta model with more free cash flow, it obviously frees management up, not that we weren't focused on this, but it frees us up to double down on everything we're doing with our brands, everything that we're doing with Honors and loyalty, some of the things you saw just recently allows us to double down on what we're doing with innovation to continue to make sure that everything we do is through the eyes of the customer and making sure that that we are ultimately driving more loyalty, more relevance with our customers and as a consequence, more share and more growth. So, we've been focused on those things, that's not to remember – obviously going without saying without having those two businesses, it just gives those of us and senior management even more time to focus on those things and do it even better and I think propel growth at an even faster rate going forward.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: And HNA?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: And HNA, which we do expect to close before the first quarter is out. We've had discussions with them, nothing is different really than the commentary I made on the last call. The discussions with them really center around how do we connect our respective travel asset, so loyalty, they have a very large loyalty program, we think there are tremendous opportunities to connect their folks with ours and ours with theirs. They are also quite active in the travel agency, both online and traditional through their tour business in China and with customers leaving China and getting very connected with them in both those regards. So though, as they close the deal at the end of the quarter and we continue those discussions, I think as the year plays out, we'll have some tremendous opportunities that connect those assets in a way that helps us and frankly, I think helps them as well, which is obviously in part why they were interested in us.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet: Thanks very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey, good morning. Chris, I think there were two drivers this cycle that kind of set it apart from other cycles from a demand perspective. One is inbound international travel, and I think we've talked about that, FX, whatnot. But the other one is kind of the millennials proclivity to travel. And I guess my question is, is there any sort of fatigue – travel fatigue you're seeing from the millennials, any change of habits from a travel perspective?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Not really. I mean, Bill, we spend a lot of time thinking about millennials and young people and young customers, and I have to say, it is certainly no trend that I have seen, if you look at our leisure business overall throughout, even the downturn, but coming out of the downturn, into this now fairly long up-cycle, it's been pretty consistently a leading positive indicator in the sense of growth has been at a strong clip, sort of leading the charge and has stayed that way. And a component of it and an increasing component of it is the millennial traveler, who I think really wants to get out with the – and experiencing. Now, I would probably say, when we wake up in a decade that's going to be over half our traveling population, if you look at it today, it's probably 20%, 25% of our population are travelers. That's one of the reasons we've been doing – in terms of our brand launches, we've been doing some of the things we've been doing, if you think about Home2 first, then Tru, now Tapestry, a lot of that, not all of it, we want to obviously appeal to a broad range of customers with all our brands, but those brands, particularly at the price points that they're at, which is at the lower end, is going to allow us we think to get younger travelers into the system and build loyalty with them. So as they grow up and they travel more in different ways they stick with us. Because the fact is, some of our products even at the lower end were at a price point that it was very difficult for certainly the younger end of millennials to stay with us. So I think the millennial travelers is alive and well, I think that certainly the trends we see is a – as a proportion of their disposable income, all the stats we can find are that they more than most generations like to use it on experiences, and thankfully travel is one of those experiences that they like to use it on.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Well, Chris that leads me into the follow-up question, which is the Stop Clicking Around campaign. If you could give us any details on how you're gauging the success of that, and the impact positive or negative to the company and to the owners? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. Great question. I mean, we gave you some of the stats that I think matter the most. So we're about a year – not quite a year from anniversary from the beginning of that campaign. And if you look at some of the stats that we disclosed earlier about 9 million new Honors member, and that number is higher now because we have more members this year, so probably over 10 million new Honors members. You look at Honors occupancy up nearly 400 basis points. And I think most important statistic is over 200 basis points in channel shift, I would say, leading to our direct low cost online channels either web-direct or mobile, that suggest to me, well this is early days and while the Stop Clicking Around campaign is done, you're going to see us to do all sorts of other things, including what you just saw with Honors to continue to build direct relationships. I would say, it's been quite successful. In the end, what our job is, is to drive profitability for owners and that means top line, but also bottom line and distribution cost is not an insignificant component of their cost structure. So if I look at the channel shift that that has occurred and we look at, what's happening from a net rate point of view across all our channels, I think in the end, our owners – I can't say every single owner in every single circumstance that it's worked perfectly, but I would say across the system, it has worked really well. We have shifted, we've obviously maintained growth and market share and shifted by a couple hundred plus basis points business to channels that drive better net revenue for our owners. So as I talk to our owners, again I could not find an exception to anything, but broadly, we just had a joint OAC meeting with a 100-plus of our most important largest owners in LA, as part of ALIS. They all seem very, very happy with what we're doing and continuing to try and build direct relationships with our customers.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Just had a quick question on the trajectory of brand launches, we've had a handful of new launches in the last two years, and I know there is still some white space remaining. But what should the trajectory of those new brand launches look like? And then, secondarily, when can these new brands start to become a material piece of that 55,000 rooms that you add each year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yes. Well, we do these things in a – hopefully, we make it look easy when we do them, but it's not easy, because not only do we have to figure out with our customers ultimately what resonates with them, but we then have to commercially make sure it's successful, because if we go out and launch something that doesn't really work for owners, then they are not going to invest the capital. So we try and give each of these a proper birth. And they all sort of go through a process, we obviously had great success last year with Tru, but we're really still – we haven't even opened our first Tru. So we're very focused on making sure that works commercially. Tapestry, which is a bit easier, because these are largely conversion hotels, existing hotels, it's plugging it into our engines, which again, I make sound easy, my team is wincing probably all over the world, it's not easy, but it's easier than starting from scratch. So we were able to move Tapestry along a little bit faster. And we need to get that under our belt and get some momentum on the develop – we have momentum, we need to get more momentum, we need to get some opened. We have four other concepts that I think we described them all very briefly, but nonetheless, described them at the Analyst Day in December, that we're developing. I think, eventually we'll do them all. And the cadence is likely, maybe one more in the soft brand area that we could do this year, because again more conversion, a little bit easier, in terms of incubating it here. The others, I think, will take a little bit longer, because they're more complicated and we're going to want to give what we've done a chance to gain some momentum. In terms of when, if you look at, what we've already done, what's sort of in the supply and in the pipeline is, we've already got 90,000 rooms out of the brands, including Home2, that we've launched over the last half a decade. So, I think these things can ramp up quickly. We have 400 deals in Tru alone, I think by the end of last year, we had 16,000, 18,000 rooms technically in the pipeline, 37,000 with what's in progress, so the rest of those will go in the pipeline. So Tru alone will probably have 30,000 or 40,000 rooms in the pipeline in the not too distant future. And those things are relatively easier to finance and smaller bites given the size of the deals, those things will start to have – the Tru's will start to have much more quickly. So, I think there are – I think our new brands are already contributing significantly to the pipeline, and in the case of Home2 particularly with the existing stock, but you'll start to see these things really contribute in terms of its existing supply in a much more meaningful way over the next two and three years.
Vince Ciepiel - Cleveland Research Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the conference call back over to Chris Nassetta for any closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Obviously been quite a busy time here at Hilton, as well as at Park and HGV. We're really thrilled for all three companies, as I said earlier, and we're pretty optimistic about how the year is playing out. We'll look forward to getting back together with you after the first quarter to give you a little bit more color on how things are playing out. Have a great day. Thanks.
Operator: And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Charnaux, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Christian Charnaux - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide third quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our third quarter results and provide details on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thank you, Christian, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Even with macro conditions that continue to underperform expectations, we delivered adjusted EBITDA and EPS consistent with our guidance and continued to increase our global share of development activity in the quarter. Our objective is to drive value beyond what the broader economy gives us and we believe our portfolio of clearly-defined brands with global scale and distribution will continue to drive market share premiums, industry-leading net unit growth and ultimately result in superior returns to our stockholders over time. We also have the opportunity to drive additional value by fully activating all segments of our business and achieving meaningful tax and capital market efficiencies through the spin-off of Park Hotels & Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations, both of which are on track for completion around year-end. Moving specifically to the third quarter results, our system-wide comparable RevPAR growth for the quarter was 1.3% on a currency neutral basis, driven entirely by rate, strong group business supported RevPAR growth in the quarter but corporate transient was softer than expected, particularly in September. Calendar shifts had a negative impact in the quarter as the unfavorable timing of July 4 more than offset the benefit of a favorable September holiday calendar. The quarterly results were also negatively impacted by continued weakness in oil and gas markets and by softer international performance with political instability and terrorism in Turkey, Belgium and France, strengthening currency in Japan, and VAT charges in China. As we look forward into Q4, we anticipate softness in transient growth to continue, especially given the unfavorable October calendar shift. Additionally, November and December are typically low group months, resulting in lower transient compression. Combined, we think this will result in flat to slightly positive system-wide RevPAR growth for the fourth quarter. As a result, we forecast full year 2016 system-wide RevPAR growth of 1.5% to 2%. As noted on our earlier calls, our prior guidance was based on 2016 U.S. GDP growth expectations of 1.5% to 2.5%. While our current outlook incorporates a more tempered consensus view of 1.25% to 1.5% GDP growth, down plus or minus 50 basis points since July. Year-to-date at a high level when adjusting for calendar shifts and other one-time events, we actually see pretty consistent RevPAR performance across the three major buckets of demand. Roughly half of our mix is business transient, which has been growing at approximately 1%, with the rest split pretty evenly between leisure transient and group business, both of which have been growing roughly 100 to 200 basis points above that. Looking forward, we continue to expect that the lodging cycle will align with the broader business cycle. In the U.S., our largest market, macro indicators point to a more positive outlook on the demand side as we head into next year with forecasts for slightly accelerating GDP growth, growth of non-residential fixed investment, rising corporate profits, incremental jobs growth, and certainly having the election cycle behind us won't hurt. Paired with easier comps, this suggests modest demand acceleration from current levels. The two pieces of business where we have reasonable sight lines, corporate negotiated and group, also support a potential acceleration in demand next year. We're in the early stage of negotiating corporate rates for next year and given record U.S. occupancy levels, we expect to increase rates roughly 3% to 4%. Similarly, in the first half of 2017, we're seeing mid-single digit system-wide group revenue position growth. This anticipated U.S. demand growth will be paired with supply growth that is expected to increase around 30 basis points next year to slightly less than 2% which is well below prior cycle peaks and still below long term averages. There's good visibility into new capacity given the years of lead time and annual estimates of supply growth this cycle have pretty consistently been higher than what has actually been delivered. Overall development continues to be largely driven by economically rational projects in markets that can support room growth and with brands that are the most desired by customers, particularly as lending standards have tightened in this lower growth market. Overall, we believe 2017 will be another year of positive RevPAR growth in the 1% to 3% range, but would note that it is early and there's still a great deal of uncertainty on how well the economy will actually perform next year. The other key growth driver for our business is net unit growth, which has more visibility than top-line growth. Our pace of room signings continues to increase and we expect another record year of more than 100,000 room signings. This fuels our pipeline, now at approximately 300,000 rooms representing a 15% year-over-year increase. Additionally, construction starts are 14% ahead of last year, meaning half the pipeline or nearly 150,000 rooms are under construction and largely expected to open over the next three years. As a result, we expect to increase our net rooms additions to more than 50,000 rooms next year. We continue to lead the industry with 6% to 7% annualized organic net unit growth with little or no capital commitment on our part. Our accelerating capital-light growth is driven by all of our high quality clearly defined brands with each of our brand segments at record pipelines. We continue to accelerate our growth by deploying existing brands to new markets and organically launching new brands. Regarding specific brands, we have some developments that I'm excited to share. In Luxury, the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills will begin accepting reservations this month for its opening next summer and the Waldorf Astoria San Francisco was recently added to our pipeline. We just celebrated the 750th hotel opening in our All Suites category, which includes our Embassy Homewood and Home2 brands. As a reminder, Home2 is the third largest brand under development in the United States only five years after its launch. More recently, we've been further leveraging Home2's success by developing dual-branded products with Tru, our newest and fastest growing brand. We now have more than 140 Tru hotels, representing nearly 14,000 rooms in the pipeline, up an impressive 55% from the second quarter. Including all rooms in various stages of development, we have 360 hotels representing approximately 35,000 rooms. The brand continues to gain tremendous traction with developers and we're looking forward to opening our first Tru early next year. Our industry-leading rate of net unit growth off a base of nearly 800,000 rooms continues to build our scale. We're in a business where scale matters and we're leaning in on these scale advantages to innovate faster, improving both our guest experience and our owners' returns. Guests continue to prefer our web-direct channels with share increasing to 28% of distribution mix in the quarter, our highest level ever. Our guests have successfully completed 20 million digital check-ins. The world is going mobile and our top-rated hotel booking app in the Apple Store is the Hilton HHonors app, which is downloaded on average every eight seconds. Through our app, guests can download their room key on their mobile device and head straight to their self-selected room upon arrival in nearly 600 hotels today. Over the next year, we expect to deploy this capability to every one of our hotels in 80 major North American markets, representing nearly half of our total global system. Earlier this week we announced the sale of Blackstone shares representing 25% of the company to HNA Group, a leader in the global travel and tourism industry with market leading positions in aviation, hospitality and travel services. We believe this strategic sale at a premium price with a thoughtful shareholder agreement that includes a two-year lock up, a perpetual stand-still and limited voting rights is a win for all parties. On the strategic side, there are many opportunities to leverage both Hilton and HNA's respective travel assets and capabilities. While we're in the early stages, we anticipate that connecting our hotel system to HNA's customers through their online and offline travel agencies and their extensive airline network and loyalty program could be of meaningful mutual benefit to both companies. We also believe that HNA's financial businesses and extensive relationship should afford opportunities to support our development growth both in and outside of China. Lastly, as we near the completion of our announced spin-offs of Park and HGV, we'd like to provide you with further information on each of the company's strategies and facilitate further interaction with the leadership of all three companies. I'm happy to announce we plan to host an Investor Day on Thursday, December 8 at the Conrad New York and we look forward to catching up with all of you more then. In closing, although our third quarter top line growth was weaker than expected and macro uncertainly continues to weigh on sentiment, we are cautiously optimistic heading into 2017. We think our portfolio is uniquely positioned to further enhance value through sustainable industry-leading unit growth and full activation of our three businesses. With that, I'm now going to turn the call over to Kevin for a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR growth was tempered by a variety of factors, most notably a softer than expected macro environment with geopolitical uncertainty further weighing on growth. In addition, we estimate that one-time items such as calendar shifts and declines in oil and gas markets pressured top line performance by 100 basis points to 150 basis points in the quarter, including approximately 70 basis points of net drag from the July 4th and Jewish holiday calendar shifts. Despite more modest top line gains, adjusted EBITDA of $765 million and adjusted EPS of $0.23 per share were in line with expectations supported by good cost control and solid performance in our purchasing business. As Chris discussed, transient business was below expectations in the quarter with RevPAR up 40 basis points. Business transient continued to be largely weak across industries and geographies with particular weakness in our oil and gas markets. Leisure transient continues to be stronger than business transient on a relative basis but was affected by terrorism and political instability in international markets. Group business increased approximately 4% in the quarter with America's owned and operating group revenue up nearly 8% versus prior-year, on strong ADR gains and more than 100 basis points of room night growth. Convention and association business was particularly strong. Solid group trends also drove strong growth in America's owned and operated F&B revenue, which increased nearly 7% versus prior-year, mostly as a result of 11% growth in banquets revenue. Turning to our segments, in the quarter management and franchise fees grew more than 7% year-over-year to $470 million in line with our expectations. Franchise fees increased over 8% boosted by new hotel ramps, stronger than expected license fees and solid new deal volume as Tru signings continued to outpace our expectations. Base management fees were flat versus the prior year due to softness in Japan, while one-time items helped incentive management fees which were up nearly 9%. In our ownership segment, flat RevPAR growth and a 4% reduction in rooms largely driven by three lease removals contributed to a decline in adjusted EBITDA to $264 million in the quarter. RevPAR performance was primarily driven by weakness in the New York and Chicago markets, as supply growth and the convention calendar affected performance. Results were further pressured by softness in Japan; however, strength in our Hawaii properties helped to mitigate some of these overhangs. Timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $85 million in the quarter. Overall timeshare sales volume increased 15% as a result of increased tour flow and net volume per guest of 5% and 9%, respectively. Third party developed intervals accounted for 63% of intervals sold in the quarter, up from 61% in the second quarter. At our current sales pace, we have nearly six years of inventory, or 127,000 intervals, more than 80% of which are third party developed. Turning to regional performance and outlook. In the U.S. comparable RevPAR grew 1.5% in the quarter. Performance was supported by good group business with Orlando and Hawaii being the primary beneficiaries. Solid leisure demand during the summer months also contributed to positive growth. Results were affected by broader weakness in corporate transient business and oil and gas markets, which we expect to pressure fourth quarter performance as well. To-date October trends are softer than anticipated and include an additional drag from the impact of Hurricane Matthew. For full year 2016, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the low single digits. In the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR rose a strong 6% versus the prior year, surpassing expectations. RevPAR in Canada increased by approximately 9% driven by good group demand. Growth in the Caribbean was tempered by Zika concerns and Brazil continued to struggle given economic weakness, offsetting any Olympic related demand gains. For full year 2016 we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be in the low to mid single-digit range. RevPAR in Europe decreased 70 basis points in the quarter due to weaker performance in continental Europe, partially offset by a 2% RevPAR gain in the UK and Ireland. Turkey suffered a 40% year-over-year decrease in the quarter due to terrorist attacks and political instability which depressed inbound travel during the country's peak summer season. Terror attacks also weighed on France and Belgium, leading to declines in transient performance. While it's still too early to know the implications of Brexit, we expect increased uncertainties surrounding potential outcomes to temper regional performance. For full year 2016, we expect slightly positive RevPAR growth for the European region. RevPAR in the Middle East and Africa dropped 2.6% in the quarter driven by unfavorable timing of Ramadan and the Hajj, coupled with political unrest in certain African markets. Improved leisure performance in Egypt and an extension of the royal protocol in Saudi Arabia mitigated these shortfalls. Our full year 2016 RevPAR growth forecast for the region is slightly negative. In the Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 60 basis points largely due to slowing performance in Japan as the stronger yen continued to reduce leisure demand and slowing exports continued to weigh on the country's economic growth. Results were further pressured by the typhoon in September. RevPAR growth in China increased nearly 3% during the quarter. China growth was tempered, however, by the recent introduction of a nation-wide VAT tax. We expect RevPAR growth in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid-single digits for the full year with RevPAR in China relatively stronger in a similar range. Both during and subsequent to the third quarter, we successfully completed a number of capital markets transactions, all with the goal of better positioning Hilton, Park, and HGV ahead of the spins around yearend. Through these deals, we reduced interest rates, pushed out and staggered our maturities and secured greater financial flexibility for each company. There's more detail on these transactions in our recently filed updated Form 10s and we intend to provide further detail on the capital structures of all three companies at our Investor Day in December. During the quarter, we also paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share bringing year-to-date cash dividends to $207 million. Our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. As Chris mentioned, given continued softness and the broader macro environment, we are lowering our full year 2016 RevPAR growth guidance to 1.5% to 2% and reducing our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges to reflect softer expected top line performance. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.96 billion to $2.99 billion and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.86 to $0.89 per share. As with prior guidance, please note that our full year ranges do not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spends. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth to be flat to modestly up. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $736 million and $776 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.20 to $0.23. Further details on our third quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we published earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please?
Operator: Absolutely. And your first question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Arpine Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC: Hi. Thank you. This is actually Arpine here for Robin. Thank you for the detail on 2017 RevPAR in the prepared remarks, but could you just elaborate a little bit more in terms of factors you're looking at today. Specifically what North American RevPAR is the current guidance for 2017 pricing in. And then in terms of group pace for 2017 overall, not just the first half of the year, what are you looking at today versus same time last year?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, happy to do that. Thanks for the question. I know that's pretty much what is on everybody's mind as what is the go forward set up look like. And I would say, as we said in the prepared comments, we've given you a sense of what we think, we're in the final stages of going through our budgets which are a granular build-up of every asset, every property around the world, aggregated together to come to a result, and best we can give you guidance today, you know we come out at the – in the 1% to 3% range. I think that the under-pinning of that I covered a bit in my comments. I think the largest contributor to that is what we've suggested, which is a belief based on what we see as a consensus view that the broader economy, particularly here in the U.S., but I think on a global basis is projected to pick up just a bit. And if you look at what's been weakest, it's been really the business transient side of the business, as I said, when you clear out all the noise, sort of growing at plus or minus 1%, we believe that if you have a little bit of an uptick in the broader economic environment, you have a little bit more certainty, particularly in the U.S. with an election behind us, which we think has the potential to release some decision-making out of corporate America on investment and the like, that you could as a consequence see a bit of an uptick in that part of the business, which is our largest segment and which has been performing at the lowest levels of all of our segments. In terms of the sight lines we talked about, I want to be cautious in the sense that it's early. We're not even done with this year, let alone into next. We're pre-election and what we're trying to do, as I said, is judge based off of what consensus estimates are. What sight lines we do have certainly support that. As I said, we've gone through a very granular budget process, aggregating every property in the world, which gives us a decent sense of around the world what our teams think, and that forms the basis of this. We look at where we are in our negotiations with all of our corporate customers, which I noted, which supports this, up in the 3% to 4% range. And as we look at the group position going into next year, as I said, the first half of the year is quite strong. It's actually a little higher than, I said, mid-single digits. It's really 6% or 7%. A little bit higher than pure mid-single-digits. And if you look at it for the full year, it's probably in the lower single digits, but there's a lot of time left to fill in in the second half of the year, that would be typically what would happen. We'll go into the year probably as we finished this year with about 70% of our group bookings on the books, but we're obviously busily working towards increasing the group booking position in the final stages of this year. So, I think all of those things are generally positive indicators, but I would, again, bring you back to the core underpinning, which is a view on the broader economy. And our view on the broader economy is being really informed by consensus views of folks that are studying this. And I think to the extent that those views end up being correct, I feel pretty darn good about being able to deliver in the range that we talked about. If those consensus views are wrong, obviously either on the high or the low, it would have an impact on our ability to deliver the 1% to 3%.
Arpine Kocharyan - UBS Securities LLC: Helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: I just had a quick follow-up on your answer there, before I get to my question. Chris, as you talk to other CEOs, what is their body language for loosening up the travel purse strings? And what do they need to see before they do it?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: You know, I would say again, anecdotal obviously, I talk to a lot of other CEOs. They talk to a lot of our biggest customers. I would say that there is a sort of view right now, particularly exacerbated by the U.S. election cycle, that everybody is nervous. They don't know. There's just a great deal of broad uncertainty. And when I talk to CEOs, I think my sense from them is that not just loosening the purse strings a little bit on travel, but just broadly making decisions, whether that be more hiring, more investment in technology, plant, equipment. All of the things that make up non-residential fixed investment which still has the highest correlation to demand growth in our business that we can track. I think broadly as I talk to them, I think people, when they have a little bit – companies and CEOs, when they have a little more certainty, I think do want to start to make decisions again to start investing and hiring and traveling and doing all the things they need to do to drive the growth in their business. I think this cycle of election – I mean everybody is watching it as I am. I think it's been an unusual cycle, and as a consequence, I think it has slowed down the economy probably more dramatically than I've seen certainly in my adult life, just in the sense of creating such an aura of uncertainty that people are sort of waiting to make decisions until it's over. Now but we don't know what's going to happen, but the one thing we do know is it'll be over on November 8. By the time we close out at midnight, we're going to have certainty of who our next president is going to be. And I think just the fact of having that type of certainty is going to be beneficial. So yeah, sort of a rambling answer. But I think you are going to get a lot of things that are going to sort of get freed up a bit which is I think one of the core underpinnings for why you might see broader economic growth tick up a bit. I don't think that means that, in my opinion or anything I'm reading from a consensus point of view, says the economy is going to start roaring. I don't think that's the view. I think it's just that things have been pretty locked up and that they're going to start to unlock a little bit.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: So my real question, not that the other one was not real is.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Your second question.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities International, Inc.: My real first question is your relationship with HNA as you envision it over the next several years. What I'm trying to get a better understanding of is how you expect joint ventures to proceed and impact in China on EBITDA growth as a result of this?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, I think it's really early to start to translate it into impact on EBITDA growth, so I'm going to avoid answering that simply because I can't give you a rational answer yet because it's relatively early days. Having said that, we've spent as you would imagine a great deal of time with the leadership of HNA as a lead-up to this transaction, and I think we believe and our board believed that there were some serious compelling strategic reasons why this was beneficial to our company. And you can imagine some of those and as time goes on, we'll give you more details as we can. But they are big time in the travel and tourism business. They're big tour operators. They have a big offline travel agency business. They're the second biggest online travel agency business, one of the biggest airlines in China and the world. They're transporting through their aviation system hundreds of millions of people a year. They have tens of millions of loyalty members, obviously incredibly well respected in China and now as a global Fortune 500 company around the world. So the idea is quite simple in a sense is that we have a big customer base, they have a big customer base. China is both the fastest growing lodging market in the world. It's also the largest outbound market in the world, and one of the fastest growing outbound markets in the world. While obviously there is some overlap in our current businesses, there's not much overlap between our core customer base and theirs, thus a tremendous opportunity to be able to connect those customer bases in ways that I think is going to help feed our system throughout the world, and particularly in China, but it's also going to help feed their system, and so I think there is mutually beneficial ways to look at this. We are having those discussions, sort of putting as I would say the meat on the bones of exactly how that's going to work. But you can imagine taking our hundreds of millions of folks and their hundreds of millions of folks where there's not a lot of overlap and connecting the dots can be incredibly powerful. And in terms of the development growth in China, they have a tremendous network of financial services investments and relationships in that market that we think are going to be hugely beneficial to us and our growth over time. Recognizing that all of our growth, in terms of our new unit growth is really dependent upon third party capital in China and everywhere else and the more access we have and relationships that we can build in all parts of the world, but particularly the fastest growing market in the world is China, we think can be tremendously beneficial to us over time. So we are very excited about the HNA deal in every way. Obviously, it helps with our overhang issue, and we think we were quite thoughtful about how we protected all of our existing shareholders against all the things that you would want us to protect against, but at the same time, managed to take down the overhang of Blackstone, which we certainly hear a lot about in the marketplace. But the strategic elements of this over time I think are going to be even more powerful, because while the overhang is important obviously, that would eventually fix itself. I think this is quite an elegant way to help fix a lot of it. But long term, I think the relationship, the fact that they're going to have a $6.5 billion investment in us and our success, and given their relationships globally and in China, I think is going to be incredibly powerful for us. I can't translate that to EBITDA growth rate yet, okay. Give us a little bit of time. And as we pull together the elements of this partnership, you're obviously going to hear a lot more about it because we're obviously going to want you to.
Operator: And our next question will come from Joseph Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Can you guys talk about how you were thinking about the composition of 2017 net unit growth, and how that compares to what you've done so far in 2016? And then with the gross additions to the pipeline, are you anticipating that those take longer to open, just given the economic backdrop we're living in right now?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I would say composition wise, very similar, 2017 very similar to 2016. It'll be higher, but if you look at the proportions of it, you know, where it's going to be and what segments it's going to be in, I'd say it is similar. In terms of the pipeline, in terms of whether the pipeline – what we're signing is getting extended out. Hard to say; I mean, my instinct, Joe, is if you look at what we're signing this year, by the time the year is out, not an insignificant component of that is going to be Tru. We're going to end up probably by the time the year is out signing 20,000 to 25,000 rooms for Tru. I mean, just given what's in production. And those are much more readily financeable given the dollar amounts we're talking about and people seem to be very able to get access to financing levels to get this done. There's also a shorter gestation period given they're smaller properties and really take less time to build. So I would say, I'm not seeing any incrementally over the last quarter or two quarters, I'm not seeing anything that says if I were to try and semi-scientifically in my head as I'm thinking about it, take what we're adding in the pipeline and what's being delivered, is it – are we extending it? I would say ultimately it's pretty comparable, you know, it's offsetting given that Tru has a shorter gestation period and smaller pieces.
Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hey, everybody. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Two part question, both kind of focused on Chris, some of your comments from earlier. You mentioned group pace for next year and I thought you said kind of first half 2017 group pace. Do you have any early indications on second half? And then also, as it pertained to the corporate negotiated rates, trending up 3% to 4%, are there any types of guarantees in terms of volume or anything that are being, you know, kind of, that have changed materially I would say in those corporate rate negotiations?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: All right. So, yeah, on the group side I think I gave the number, I intended to. For the first half of the year, it's up, call it 5% to 7%. For the full year, it's up probably 2% to 3%, something like that. So that obviously implies the second half of the year is lighter. Part of that's just sort of the convention cycle, part of that is second half of the year is a long way away, so but – that's the full year sort of look on it. On the volume question on transient, the short answer is no. We don't really have a lot of guarantees of volume. There are incentives built into pricing so that, you know, they're not guarantees as much as you get a better price if your volume is higher or you get a worse price if it's lower. But it's not – it doesn't – the set-up is not in the form of a guarantee. Anecdotally, again it goes back to the question I think Harry asked about what are you hearing from CEOs, what are you hearing from customers, you know, CEOs of companies that are big customers of ours. I'm not hearing anybody really say, you know that, hey, we're going to be cutting back on a lot of volume. I mean, they're obviously pushing back on our trying to push rates up, that's why we're at 3% to 4%, but they know occupancy levels are high, so they're accepting that. I think if I had to summarize my discussions anecdotally I'd say it feels like flat, it feels like sort of flat volume. I think if the economy gets worse I think it'll – as I said, I think it'll drive volumes lower. But I think if the economy gets a little bit better, it'll keep it flat or maybe you'll see a little bit more. As I said, the highest correlation to demand in the hotel business is non-residential fixed investment. I've been studying this for 15 years and it's ebbed and flowed in terms of what the R-squared is, but it's always been very high. If you look at what's been happening this year as we've seen business transient growth levels really drop precipitously. I mean, we were in the 6% to 8% range, now we're in the 1% range, and you look at what's happened with non-residential fixed investment, non-residential fixed investment is going backwards. It's negative growth this year. I think everybody's – again, broader expectations are that that's going to, you know, that that's going to increase next year. If non-residential fixed investment increases next year, I think you will see flat or increasing volumes in business transient. So, I think we should all watch that and the broader economy carefully because we're going to track – generally on the top line we're going to track in line with that business transient very much so.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And then, Kevin, you might have said this in your remarks and I apologize if I missed it, but I assume some of the timeshare margin softness was related to timing, but is there anything else you can kind of add to kind of the decline year-over-year in segment margin?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. You've got it, Carlo. We left the overall guidance range the same for timeshare. It's about $5 million or $6 million of timing items that are related to – $5 million or $6 million that are related to exactly what you say which is timing items. So nothing really going on there.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Can you just remind us of what your capital allocation priorities will be post the spin as you balance some of the added financial flexibility from the recent transactions with the softening macro?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah. I think from a capital allocation point of view, we're exactly where we've been. We want to get the balance sheet to a credit profile that is low grade investment grade. We think that's in the low threes. We're sort of there now. We leverage up a teeny amount related to all the spins and the costs and the incremental G&A that's associated with the spins, but we very quickly get it back down. We're going to continue to pay a modest dividend. We're not really thinking of doing anything material to the dividend, and then using the incremental cash flow to buy back stock. The likelihood is we'll be discussing it with our Board, that early next year we'll be able to be in a position to begin a buy-back program. And that's pretty much what we've been saying. Nothing's really changed in that regard.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. And then you mentioned earlier about the potential for renegotiating your corporate credit card program. Can you just talk about the various financial impacts from that? Or what that could – how that could impact the business? And maybe sizing what it would look like right now? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I would love to, but I can't right now. We're literally in the middle of a bidding process amongst a number of bidders and I would prefer to get to the end of that process and not debate it or negotiate it publically. So give us a little bit more time. We're not – we're getting close to the final stages of that and when we have that done, we'll obviously be happy to talk about it, and give you a sense of where it ends up. But we have very healthy competition and we think we're going to get a very positive outcome for the company. I'd rather leave it at that until we're done.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Fair enough. So if I could maybe sneak one other quick one in. Just on the direct booking efforts, can you just update us on what the net impact has been as the penetration has grown? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, our direct booking efforts, you can see with some of the stats we gave in the prepared comments, is working well. The whole objective here has been where we can have a direct relationship with a customer we want to, because we think in the end customers get the best value and will have the best experience. We want them to know that and, to the extent that they get the best experience and we can do it through our lowest cost distribution channels, it's better for us, it's better for customers and it's better for our owners, which is – we're here to serve all constituencies. And you can see from the stats that it's working really well. We've had over 200 basis points of channel shift to our direct channels. We've had huge increases in our HHonors enrollment, up 60% year-to-date. And, when you look at, sort of, our net rate structures, everything that we see across all of our rate structures suggests that our owners and we are benefiting from it. Having said that, it's really important to note that we still have a healthy relationship with the OTAs. We still do a lot of work with them. There are still customers that, for whatever reasons, don't want to have a direct relationship with us and that we still want to have stay with us, and that we can access through intermediaries including the OTAs. And for those customers that understand this setup and that still want to – do not want to have a direct relationship, we obviously want to serve them as well. And so we've had a relationship over the long term with the OTAs, we'll continue to have that relationship where they have unique access to a customer we may not be able to have access to, but the combination of those things I think can be quite powerful for us. But we think customers are increasingly understanding the benefits of a book-direct relationship as is depicted with the channel shift we have.
Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a little bit more granular of a question, but Kevin, in the guidance I think the fourth quarter is looking for 2% to 4% management and franchise fee growth, and if we think about sort of your algorithm with 6% to 7% net unit growth and still positive RevPAR, even if modest seems like a little bit of a wider spread in the fourth quarter. So is there anything one-time in that or anything that might be driving that spread? And then, my follow-up will go ahead and be, how do you think about that spread next year when we have to think about FX and mix from new openings?
Kevin J. Jacobs - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: So the first part, Shaun, is easy. We did have a couple of pretty significant one-time items, primarily termination fees that affect the growth rate this year, so the algorithm, if you will, is pretty much intact when you look at the full year. And I think we think about the algorithm going forward in the fee segment as being just about the same as you described. If you look at same-store sales growth plus net unit growth, that ought to be the algorithm in the fee section other than, as you mentioned, FX. It's hard to predict. We don't bake FX into our algorithms. It's really hard to predict, so I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, and on December 8 when we get together and we lay out all three companies separately, we'll lay out in great detail how we view the algorithm going forward for Hilton Worldwide RemainCo.
Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch: Fantastic. We'll look forward to that. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, I want to go back to the HNA announcement, because we've gotten a lot of questions from investors regarding the transaction, so just wanted to touch on a few of them.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Sure.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: The first is just regarding the incremental sale of the 54 million shares of stock by Blackstone following the sale to HNA prior to the REIT election, so we've gotten a lot of questions about how the math works and the ownership restrictions under the REIT tax laws. So maybe you can walk us through that. I think it would be helpful.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I'd be happy to but time does not allow for it. Kidding aside, the rules that we're dealing with within the IRS code are called the EIK rules, they're incredibly complex and very difficult to come up with like an easy equation for you. If they own X, they're selling Y, because it has a lot to do with how Blackstone owns the shares in the company and the various funds that they have, very complex attribution rules. And even attribution on a go-forward basis has between large shareholders like HNA and Blackstone, even though they are unrelated in the attribution rules, they become related to a certain degree. Now I'm not trying to be evasive. The truth is there are a lot of really smart people in our tax and with outside advisors that have figured out how all of this works because ultimately we have to get an opinion that says that we meet the REIT qualification rules. As we've done all that work, again, not a simple equation because of the complexities of the attribution rules, it became apparent to us in doing the work that in order to qualify, we needed to have Blackstone sell down 5.5% and that's why we've disclosed it. Obviously, we can do the spins without that sell down because this problem only arises as a consequence of the HNA deal. So really they have to have done this by the time the HNA deal closes. So we could do the spins and there was no EIK issue under the setup pre-HNA. Now that the HNA deal is getting done, prior to that closing, in order to meet the REIT qualification test, they would have to sell down the 5.5%. So I know you want me to sit and give you a very simple equation; it's just not that simple. But we are 100% confident that the work that has been done is right and that if they sell down 5.5% prior to HNA closing, we will meet all of the REIT qualification rules upfront and can be able to continue to meet those rules.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So just to paraphrase, you need to be below 35% and you can't just take the 25% HNA plus the then 15%-ish the Blackstone added.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. It would take literally 50 pages of analysis to do this and I don't have it in my head. It is much more complex than that, and there's no way anybody, and I'm not being – there's no way anybody can do it because you've got to know the intricacies of how Blackstone holds all this and how HNA is going to hold all this, because the attribution rules are not entirely logical. It is not a simple equation. And again, I'm not trying to be evasive, it's just it is not that simple. The thing I think that's important for investors to know is that this fixes it. Okay. And that the timing of it is such that it needs to be done before the closing of HNA buying 25% of the company.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: And there will be no issue. And it will be solved permanently.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. But the 5.5%, the 54 million, so that's all they need to sell?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: That's it. That's all they need to sell. Now Blackstone can sell whatever they want. It's their choice whether they want to sell more. But the contractual commitment that we have with them is that they will do this so that we make sure that Park qualifies as a REIT.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then this gets to my next question. So I was just wondering if you could address any risks to the HNA transaction, particularly on the regulatory side. And what steps need to be taken for it to get approved?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, I mean there's not much to say about that. Obviously, we just announced the deal. We do not think that there are big regulatory challenges to get over. And so I do not personally think that there's a great deal of risk from a regulatory point of view. But time will tell. We'll go through the process.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then you addressed this. This is my final question, talking about the relationship with HNA and all the synergistic relationships that you can have. But we get questions about the two board seats that are going to HNA, and if you foresee any concerns or do you have any concerns about conflict of interest there?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No, I don't. I think we attached the shareholder agreement and filed it so that if you want to or any investor wants to, you can read. I think we filed 180 pages of supporting documentation. So everything is 100% transparent. I think if you looked at how we dealt with both how they come on the board with one HNA-affiliated member, one unaffiliated independent member, both board members that have to go through a vetting process with our nominating committee where we are able to say yes or no, and how those board members can interact and participate on issues that might be in conflict with HNA's investment, or in the event that there is other M&A activity that we're interested in pursuing. If you look at it very carefully, we were very thoughtful about making sure that where there might be potential for conflict, we limited their voting rights. We limited what they can participate in board discussions, and on the board we also limited their voting rights, ultimately on certain transactions and events to make sure that we dealt with those conflicts. So we've spent months, literally, of time on these issues. We had a special committee of our board that went through an incredibly rigorous process with outside advisors, both on the banking, legal side. Management was very actively engaged with them in giving it our advice. And the reason it took a couple months is because we wanted to make sure we were protecting the base of other shareholders in the company against any potential conflict. So again, you can read it in detail. I feel incredibly comfortable that we have protected against any eventuality and that we're going to be able to run the company the way we need to run the company, that they're going to be engaged with us in a very constructive way, and that anywhere there is a potential for conflict vis-à-vis existing shareholders, we protected the existing shareholders, including ourselves, against any of those concerns.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you very much.
Operator: And the next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Just a real quick question here and I'm sorry if I might have missed this earlier. When you gave your group expectations for next year, can you break down how that's composed of occupancy versus rate? Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It is I would say largely rate. It's a little bit of volume, but I'd say, best I can remember it's like 80/20, something like that, 80% rate, 20% volume. But there is a little bit more volume.
Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Good morning, Bill.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Can I get a clarification first? You talked about the Tru brand and its contribution to the pipeline. How many franchised units are actually under construction today or by the end of this year do you anticipate?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: I think by the end of this year probably a dozen, something like that, I can get a maybe a little bit higher, but I'd say 10 to 20.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I assume that's in line with your expectations that you had.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, everything given we just launched it in February, yes, everything. Some deal signings, pipeline under construction are all ahead of our expectations.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. If you don't mind, I want to ask a big picture question on timeshare. For those of us that don't spend as much time looking at that industry, Chris, who's the next buyer of timeshare? I mean it doesn't seem to me like Millennials have the loyalty or maybe the interest of doing it. The Baby Boomers are getting towards 70 years old. They're not necessarily. So who's the next generation of buyers?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: You know what, Bill, it's a great question. I think we're all the next generation of buyers, right. So if you look at the breakdown and where we're selling timeshare, it's a pretty diverse demographic. And you got to remember that what timeshare is selling is a vacation. This is not a second home or a third home market. This is simply selling, if you're going to go on vacation once a year, you can do it and save a lot of money and have a lot more space and take your whole family and you can trade it for wherever you want to be or you can trade it for hotel rooms. It's a incredibly flexible vacation alternative and so I think if you went through the sales pitch, what you'd find is that's what's compelling. People look at it and those people who have one or two, in many cases three or four units, are basically saying, yeah, I'm going to take one or two or three weeks of vacation and this is a very cost-efficient way for me to take vacation, be able to take my family or friends, have a kitchen, have a washer dryer and have all these things. So now you've got to sort of break, and I know you know this, so you get the break from – the people that don't understand the business very well I think, think of it more as a like this is sort of in lieu of a second home or whatever. And it's just not that. So I think it's appealing to anybody that is looking to go on a vacation and is looking for a value proposition and I think that transcends age, honestly.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Maybe we'll get more into it at your meeting up in December.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, and we'll have our whole timeshare team there with us as well.
Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks.
Operator: And the next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning. So it's been about a month since Marriott closed on the Starwood deal. Now that you've had some kind of real time data, any updated thoughts on the potential impact to your business? Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: No. I'm not going to – I mean, I think – the way I think about it is we are very confident in the strategy that we're pursuing and that we've articulated, which is we're very focused on having purebred brands that our leaders in their individual segments that have clearly defined swim lanes, that have premium market share and as a consequence help us drive industry leading organic net unit growth, that's our strategy, others have taken different paths. I'm not going to get into – obviously we've chosen our strategy because we think it's the best strategy, otherwise we would change it. I remain confident in our strategy. I think as we continue to deliver the results that we're delivering and net unit growth particularly in the post-spin world, I think the strategy and the success of it will speak for itself. As for what Marriott or anybody else is doing, I think you have, I'm not going to comment on it. I think you got to ask them about – if you want to talk about their strategy, I'm sure they're going to have a call in the next couple of weeks and you can ask them about it. We're very confident in our strategy. You can see in terms of deal signings, starts, unit growth, all those things that are incredibly positively impactful to our bottom line and our story. We're continuing to pick up some pretty good momentum.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I mean I guess my question was more, are you seeing it impact your unit growth, or is it helping you negotiate with OTAs? But I think the second part of your question largely answered that – good answer, sorry.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, we're doing just fine. We are picking up. There are lots of reasons for why we're gaining momentum, but I think the statistics sort of speak for themselves. We continue to pick up some steam.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. And then just my follow-up, in terms of the direct booking push, how are you thinking about it, is it impacting RevPAR at all?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: It is not affecting RevPAR in a material way. It's really hard to sort of – I know others have said it's so many basis points. I mean as we've studied it, I think it's really hard to say. I think intellectually it's hard to debate that it's not having a little bit of impact given de-ranking and dimming that's going on within the OTA world. But it's not so meaningful that we can really measure it in a hard way. What I would say is, if we look at it, and we have measured this very carefully, if we look at our net rate, effectively, sort of the net rate, net of distribution costs relative to where we are now versus where we were, we're better off across the board. Meaning that you'd be willing to sacrifice in theory a little top line growth if the result was you're bringing your distribution costs down and that your net rate effectively is higher. Across every one of our categories our net rates are higher. So there's probably some modest amount of impact built into the last couple of quarters and the next couple quarters of RevPAR growth, on the headline RevPAR, but on a net rate basis we're better off because we're shifting to our lowest cost channels and ultimately our job is to drive better results for our owners who are investing all the capital to help us continue to drive that net unit growth we're talking about. Our owners are incredibly supportive of what we're doing because they're benefiting from what's going on.
Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Helpful. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: And the next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Going back to the scale question. How big, or how much run way do you have to capture scale? Do you need to get x percent of a market? Or a certain size globally? Where do you get the most bang for the buck on getting scale?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Here's the thing. I think scale does matter. I said it in my prepared comments and I think we have it, right? I guess we went from the largest in the world to the second largest post Marriott-Starwood merger. But if you take our pipeline in our rooms in the existing supply, we have 1.1 million rooms. We think that gives us all the scale that we need and we certainly, if you look at the market share numbers that we're driving in each of our brands, that's partly, obviously, great products, great service, but partly the result of the network effect that scale creates. If you look at each of those brands, they are leading their segments in terms of market share. So I think the hard scientific evidence would say scale matters and we have it. And what we're obviously trying to do is then lead into it more around the world and build more network effect in the various regions around the world where we operate. So we feel really good about where – there's no deficiency, I guess I'd say. I think there's opportunity. We've got enough of a network effect that, I think shows up in all the numbers that I just described, to be able to really take advantage of the scale. And now it's to opportunistically continue to layer brands in different locations in different chain scales and markets to just continue to strengthen that network effect.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay. And then looking at your various regions in the setup for next year, how do you see? Do you see any demand headwinds in Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific or is the supply going to be a concern in any of those regions? And looking specifically at a smaller market for you, the Middle East, Africa, for the year-to-date numbers, occupancy down quite a bit, but you seem to have the most pricing power in that region. So I'm just kind of curious what's going on there?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, on a regional basis I think honestly, next year is going to look a lot like this year. I hope it's all a step change up a little bit. But in terms of the relative performance around the world, I think it's going to look a lot like this year, which is Asia Pacific probably leading the charge, non-U.S. Americas sort of doing reasonably well and comparable. The U.S. market being sort of in the middle of the pack and Europe, and Middle East, Africa being a little bit lower than the midpoint because of an assumption that European economy is going to continue to have anemic growth and Brexit concerns, generally, as you get closer to an actual event of the UK leaving the EU. In terms of Middle East, I just think that it's a very small region relative to many of the others. There's just enough sort of disruption in enough places where I think we do expect to be positive next year, but relatively modest growth there.
Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Okay, thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi, thanks. Just along those same lines, as you think about next year and across the 1% to 3% outlook, could you maybe comment on how you think the owned portfolio would do? I mean do you think maybe like 100 basis points short of that range, given the concentration in some large U.S. markets that face some tough difficulties or how are you sort of thinking about that?
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, again, we'll give you a lot more detail on that when we have all the Park folks and we've fully completed the budget process, which is nearing completion, but not done. But I think your summary is probably a reasonable assumption.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. I just wanted to ask you one more question on your performance system-wide in the third quarter for RevPAR. And I know it's not one-for-one with SGR, but it seems like no matter kind of how you cut it, looking at your brands, looking at your U.S. only, it was a significant shortfall to what SGR put up, which would have experienced the same calendar shifts you talked about. So do you attribute that to – you talked about some of the regional weakness in more oil markets or is there a concentration in areas that were relative underperformers? I would just like to understand that a little better because it seems such a shortfall.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah I know, Smedes, it's a good question. I'd say there are three or four reasons for it as we've looked at it, some of which we've talked about before. I mean the Star data, first of all, is non-comp where we're a comp, so yes, you have to adjust for that. Segment weighting, which you talked about, obviously can have an impact. I think a few other things. One, we're more urban in orientation than you would find on average in Star and the urban markets, particularly because business transient was so weak, we're more beat up. We have a little bit higher average representation from the oil and gas markets which were, it's hard to believe they keep getting worse, but they do, which I think hurt us. And then there's probably, to my earlier comment, a little bit of impact from the OTA situation that I talked about. Again, we're willing to trade a little bit of headline top line RevPAR for net RevPAR if you will, that it's higher because that drives a better result for our owners. But my guess is, again, I can't measure it perfectly, my guess is there's certainly some modest impact in the third quarter from what's going on with the OTAs.
Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Yeah.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta - Hilton Worldwide Holdings, Inc.: Well, thanks everybody for the time today. I'm glad to see this call worked out better than the last one when the AT&T trunk line shut down us. We got to do it in one shot instead of two. We appreciate the time. Really look forward to getting together with as many as can join us in New York on December 8 at the Conrad in New York downtown. We'll have all the management teams there and look forward to walking you through all three companies in a great deal of detail. So we'll see you then. And thanks again for the time today.
Operator: Thank you, Mr. Nassetta. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-07-27 12:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Question-and-Answer Session. All participants will be in listen-only mode. Please note this event is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Charnaux, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Denise. Our apologies again for the technical issues with our conference call provider this morning. Welcome to the QA section of the Hilton's second quarter 2016 earnings call. We're going to do the Safe Harbor again real quick. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. And forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. We gave our prepared remarks earlier this morning and now we'll go straight to Q&A with Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. With that, Denise, may we have our first question?
Operator: Certainly. Your first question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, everyone. Thanks and good afternoon. And, Chris, I apologize if you've covered a lot of this in your prepared remarks, but I wanted to maybe understand a little bit more inherent in your new guidance to achieve the high end of the range, what has to happen and is that purely reliant on corporate transient and could you maybe provide a little bit of an update as to kind of what you are seeing in July month-to-date? Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta: We covered it, Carlo, a little bit, but I'm happy to give a little bit more color. As indicated in the prepared comments, for us to get above the midpoint, we'd have to see a significant reacceleration in demand, particularly in the corporate segment, yes, I do think, we believe that the Group business is hanging in there, as we had expected. So that's why, in the comments, we really directed people to the low to the midpoint of the guidance. And the way I would summarize it, sort of when you boil it all down, is that for now, I mean, you've had holiday shifts going on, you have some holiday shifts that are going to occur for the rest of the year. But, when you sort of neutralize all that noise, transient demand driven by business, transient demand has been sort of growing in the low 2%s, plus or minus, Group demand has been better than that and it's been without the noise sort of producing a 2% to 3% outcome, in terms of RevPAR growth. That's why, we are sort of guiding you to the low to the midpoint, was the expectation of, if you believe things are going to continue the way they have, that's what you deliver. If you think things are going to get better as a consequence of the economy getting better in the form of incremental business transient, then you could be better than that, but I think that's sort of the zone, as I say when you neutralize for the noise is that, I think we have been performing at is, essentially 2% to 3% for the reasons that I discussed. In July, I think, the way to think about the third quarter is July in part again for holiday shift reason is weak, picks up in August, but August is August. It's not exactly the most robust travel period for us, given that the bulk of our demand is business demand and then September is much, much stronger than both July and August with a very strong Group base to support it and obviously more active business travel part of the quarter.
Carlo Santarelli: Great, Chris. Thanks. That's very helpful.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Okay, next.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeff J. Donnelly: Good morning, guys, or good afternoon.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, sorry about that.
Jeff J. Donnelly: Yes, no problem. I am not sure if there's a question limit here, but just I guess first one is around you removed some of the language around debt reduction from your expected uses of capital, I suspect due to the spinoffs, just looking beyond that time though, looking beyond 2016, do you expect to use capital in the future to circle back and include debt reduction paydown like say in 2017 or is that to be determined?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, I don't think our capital return viewpoint has changed and that's why we didn't really highlight it here. I think, we are going to as a consequence of the spins and the cost associated with that leverage up generally if you look at HoldCo a bit, but believe that as we exit the spins and go to next year, we will be able to get the leverage levels back to the stated goals of being in the low 3 times-s, which is consistent. During that timeframe, we expect to continue of course to pay dividends. The Park will pay its dividends, RemainCo, Hilton Worldwide, will pay its dividends and then on behalf of Hilton Worldwide, we would expect early in the year to be talking to our board about a stock buyback program. We may be in order to get the leverage back down to low 3 times-s because it takes up a little bit, I would expect, we would be paying off some debt in the earlier part of next year, but we would also be thinking about a buyback program contemporariness with that.
Jeff J. Donnelly: Yes, it's helpful. And just maybe two questions on just different demand segments. On corporate transient, does HHonors give you guys the granularity to see if some of the softness in corporate transient is more than just of a less demand and it's sort of data that's granular like a same-store customer either trading down on price point or taking fewer trips or staying fewer nights. Can you see that in your system?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think we can see lots of data, but what I'd say sort of the K.I.S. rule, keep it simple. I think what's happening is, Corporate America, whether it's big companies, medium, small, I think you're just seeing lower demand. And we're getting mostly rates. So I think, what's happening is, volumes are relatively flat and rates up a little bit and I think it's a consequence of what we had witnessed as an economy, which was in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year, a significantly lower overall economic growth. Now, I think when you get to the print of Q2, you're going to see much higher economic growth and certainly every expectation is for the second half to be better. We do know that historically we've had a lag somewhere one quarter to two quarters on sort of economic growth translating into demand growth in the corporate business. We haven't really seen it yet, but expectation I think would be when you see Q2 be stronger, and I think Q3 and Q4 eventually will flow through. Yes, it's just hard to know exactly when that occurs and we have not seen it to my earlier point in any meaningful way. We've seen positive growth, I mean we've seen transient growth as I said sort of in the low 2%s, but you'd obviously as a consequence of seeing broader economic growth pickup, like to see it flow through. And I think every expectation would eventually it will flow through, it sort of stands to reason by any historical standard.
Jeff J. Donnelly: And just a last question on Group. Can you just talk about the trends in cancellation and attrition rates as well as your year for the year Group booking pace? I'm just curious what you're seeing there, effects maybe what your thinking is for 2017 and 2018 Group of shorter-term Group trends might be weakening?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. We have not seen any negative activity in attrition or cancellations. And in fact in the first quarter I think we noted that it was down year-over-year, second quarter was consistent year-over-year. So there is nothing abnormal going on there. As we look at pace in the year, for the year, generally relatively strong. If you look at pace in this year going into next year and as a result what position is for next year, relatively strong position for next year and sort of up in the mid-single-digit. So, they're not indications of something going wrong in the Group side.
Jeff J. Donnelly: Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Our next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff: Hey, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Hey, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff: Sorry, if you kind of talked about this a little bit on the earlier calls. And obviously, you're not seeing this in your development pipeline, but can you just talk about the conversations, Chris, you might be having with the development community? And how much of this deceleration in corporate demand and corporate transient RevPAR growth is having an impact on the mindset of those looking to build out or convert new supply, and how those conversations might be evolving, say, since the beginning of the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. I would say, honestly, Joe, have lots of discussions with owners across the board. And given that they're owner-operators, most of them, they're seeing what's going on with demand patterns across the board, particularly in corporate transient demand. I've not seen any material impact, and they're thinking about what they're trying to do from a development point of view. I do believe that there is generally, amongst the development community, and I happen to agree with this, a fair amount of optimism, and that optimism is based on the fact that the U.S. economy is picking up a little bit, in my earlier comment, that eventually that has to flow through to corporate transient demand by any historical standards. So I think the development community, and I agree, thinks that it will. And while certainly, I don't think anybody is being a Pollyanna and has a view that we're going to go back to transient growth trends of the type that we saw maybe in the first half of last year or before, I do believe that people have a general belief that those trends could pick up, and that in any event, we're going to continue to see positive fundamentals, meaning positive RevPAR growth, albeit it's at a little bit lower level than what we had been experiencing, but positive RevPAR growth, simply as a consequence of continuing increases in demand, at lower levels, but increases in demand met with capacity additions that are still in the 1%s, and still below any sort of 30-year historical average. So, I mean the financing markets generally have been reasonably strong, a couple of conversations with folks would say they're maybe having to put up a little bit more equity, maybe their spreads have had increased, but I think those spreads have come back in with the – even post Brexit – with the markets stabilizing. The debt markets have been quite strong generally, of late. So, I could go on, but I won't. Not a material change in the view of our ownership community. And you can see from the numbers that we outlined in Tru, tremendous progress there, obviously that's a very – that's a product that's very much a value proposition, and it's a lower cost to build, lower number of rooms, lowest price point in terms of cost per room to build. But I think people feel very confident in their ability to get those deals and other deals, they're working on finance, and still have confidence that the cycle has legs to it.
Joseph R. Greff: Thank you.
Operator: And our next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please, go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi. Thank you. Chris, I was wondering if you could just tell us what the leisure transient growth was in the first quarter and second quarter?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. It was on the higher end. I think it was in the 4%s, not quite all the way to mid-single, not quite 5%, but it was in the 4%s year-to-date.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. Year-to-date. And then...
Christopher J. Nassetta: So, it was weighting up now, it's a smaller percentage of the overall mix of transient, but it was weighting up performance where the corporate side was weighting it down and that's how you end up in the low 2%s. I mean again, every month's different and you have the calendar shifts that, when we sort of neutralize it all, which is I was trying to maybe oversimplify, but I think it's helpful to think about it that way. The transient's growing in the low 2%s, Group's growing better than that, that's how you're delivering sort of 2% to 3% until further notice. Further notice being, you see something change in the economy, either positive or negative. Obviously, we're hopeful, with the broader growth picking up, that that's going to be on the positive side.
Felicia Hendrix: Good, that's helpful. And then the strong Group business that you're seeing in September, I was just wondering how much of that's coming from the holiday shift?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Some of it's holiday shift, but it's overall strong. I can't be scientific enough to give you the exact percentages, but it's both. I mean clearly, you have the holiday shift helping September, hurting October, but you also have a very robust sort of Group funds going in any event.
Felicia Hendrix: And then, if you could look to October, I mean I know if you kind of backed out the holiday shift, if you could, do you see consistent, strong growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, I mean October is going to get hurt by that. It's not a bad Group calendar, but year-over-year it's going to be hurt because of...
Felicia Hendrix: Yes.
Christopher J. Nassetta: ...what's going on. Again, if you neutralize all that, honestly, the way I think about it is, all these all you had Q2, you had the 4th of July thing going on in the beginning – that affected it. Q3, you've got benefit of the Jewish holidays, you got the offsetting in Q4 but these are your comps in Q4. There is a lot of noise. I won't keep going. Either way I think about it is that Q3 and Q4 in the end will end up because of all that noise being relatively comparable in performance, certainly as we look at all the puts and takes. We think Q3 and Q4 are going to be relatively comparable.
Felicia Hendrix: And then just to put your leisure comment in perspective, what was that comping against last year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Similar. It's been very – I can get to the exact number later. I mean it's been very consistent over the last couple of years. Leisure has been good.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Leisure has been good, and generally sort of trending up mid-single digits, pretty consistently over the last couple of years.
Felicia Hendrix: And then just a final quick one, because I think this will be a quick answer, just getting back to Group and you were saying that how strong it's been. There's just been a few companies that we've heard from so far saying that they're seeing weaker short-term Group bookings particularly in terms of small corporate meetings. Are you seeing that at all?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, not in any material way that has shown up and with the data I've looked at.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. Just a little bit further question on expectations for leisure transient, what are you thinking for performance for that segment for the rest of the summer?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think it's going to be relatively good, so I think it's going to be higher than the average of our overall transient growth rate, so let's say in the 3% to 5% range.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. One other question. When you look at for the business traveler, the various sort of customer segments, whether it's financial services, technology, who has given you the most pushback on what we say rate or demand and who are you performing better with at the moment?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I wish I could be precise, but the real truth is that the weakness is broad-based. And so, I can't really – when I talk to our sales team, which I do frequently, I can't like pick out whether it's pharma or technology or financial services, I would say again just because everybody has been experiencing in the fourth quarter particularly in first quarter, weakness in the macro environment I think it has been sort of a general dampening of demand across most industries. So, there is nothing that really comes to mind to highlight.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. I hear you. Thank you.
Operator: And the next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis: Hi, guys. Just a quick follow-up on Group for next year. Chris, can you comment on your pace and position for next year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. I thought I said it but maybe just neglected too. Pace has been relatively healthy for Group bookings this year going into next year. And position is mid-single digits. So, position is slightly stronger next year than for full year this year.
Harry C. Curtis: And is it your expectation or would you expect at this point in the economic cycle to begin to see that soften, several other companies have talked about Group softening a bit, but your seems to be stronger.
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'd say it's a little bit stronger, I wouldn't say it's wildly stronger. And I think it's entirely dependent on what happens in the macro environment. We believe the broader global economy is going to pick up, and a lot of the groups in the U.S. U.S. economy is going to be stable to picking up. I think that's what you would expect to see in the Group side of the business. So, I think that's why – its' a longer lead business, it doesn't tend to vacillate up and down as quickly with changes, but I think if the economy stays, if economic forecasts are right for this year and next year for the U.S. economy, which I think consensus is 1.9% for this year and 2.2% for next year. I think the Group business will be fine, and I think you'll ultimately see a bit of an uptick in corporate transient business that will help you. It's not, in my opinion, I don't think we see on the horizon that's it's going to go back to where it was. We're not going to see corporate transient demand growing 6% or 8% which was what we were experiencing up until and through the first half of next year, but you could certainly see better than the low 2%s that we've been seeing in transient as a consequence of that. But the Group will act generally consistently with transient on a lag, I mean I think that's the way, just on a longer lag, I mean it's obviously a longer lead business. So, transient today is really weak, because the economy stays really weak, eventually it will ripple through to Group. If the economy is stable and potentially going back up a little bit, then you'll see Group hang in there just fine.
Harry C. Curtis: And thank you. And just a housekeeping question on your expected leverage ratio early next year at the new Hilton, what might that look like?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. We're going to have an Analyst Day or equivalent to walk through all three companies. I think the way to think about it is sans the spins the company HoldCo, would end up at about three times by year end, which would be on target. We're going to probably tick up a little over 20 bps, and then we got to split it up between the three companies. We gave guidance in that regard, which was for us 3.25 times. Hilton Worldwide 3.25 times to 3.50 times, so that's probably we think we would be in that zone. For Park, 3.75 times to 4 times and HGV generally one times and we think all three of those are consistent with sort of market norms and the respective industries where those companies and with the comps that those companies will be going against. So, 3.25 times to 3.50 times in that zone which is a little bit higher than the low 3 times-s we want to be at but I think we believe we can quite rapidly get it back down to that 3 times or close to 3 times.
Harry C. Curtis: Thanks, Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, Harry.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley: Hey, good afternoon. So, Chris or KJ, I was just wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the owned/leased performance lowering the guidance there to 1% to 3% that's sort of at the low end of what we are seeing some of the other lodging REITs coming in at this quarter for their outlooks for the year? What do you think the drivers are and some of the pluses and minuses when you think about the geographies that the only segment has?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, Shaun, it's Kevin. I'll take that one. When you think you've seen the markets that have been underperforming in the first half of the year where we have big box hotels with relatively big exposures like New York and Chicago, so that's certainly part of it. And then we have some hotels in the ownership segment that – in parts of the world like Japan that's struggling a little bit with the strengthening in their currency, that's affecting domestic travel, places like Turkey, Istanbul where you've had geopolitical type events. So, it's a little bit spread around the world, but obviously the big box hotels in urban markets that are struggling has a little bit of an outsized effect into size of the hotels.
Shaun C. Kelley: That's helpful. And sort of maybe the flip side to that question is, seems like you're actually doing a really good job of holding margin there with just I think still up 10 basis points year-to-date. Where are you guys out on the cost side there in terms of margin's already very high, so are you starting to actually reduce cost or are you still at more of like an efficiency phase level where you still think there are more things to gain in the portfolio without actually cutting costs or moving to contingency plans?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, I think it's a bit of both, Shaun, I mean what you saw on the first quarter was margins were up really strongly, 150 basis points and then obviously in the second quarter, overall RevPAR for the segment at 70 basis points makes it hard to maintain margins, and so margins were down 100 basis points. So, what you saw in the first quarter was our – we have really good cost discipline and we're sort of reaping what we sowed over the past couple of years in terms of being really efficient. And then when the revenue side gets softer, then you got to lean in a little bit more and so we are working our labor management systems, we're watching management levels, working on procurement initiatives, we'll get a little bit of benefit in the back half due to energy prices we think. And so, that all goes into the mix and that's why we think we'll still grow margins and EBITDA lower than we have in the past, but will still grow for the full year.
Shaun C. Kelley: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thanks. I just had two quick ones. One, through the first half, it looks like EBITDA came in towards the higher end of your range and RevPAR was at the lower end of the range. Is that primarily because it looks like timeshare has just been performing better and do you think that those will sort of align more through the second half of the year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, so I think it's both timeshare and then fees. Some of the fee growth on the non-recurring fees and signing, application fees, et cetera so I do think those as you think about the full year guidance we're giving should definitely align more than we have in the first quarter and second quarter.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you specifically on San Francisco for next year, which obviously has a big downtick in Group, in Group's booking because of the Moscone Center renovations. Will you guys suffer from that or will you be able to maybe take Groups away since you have a fair amount of Group space yourself at those larger hotels that you own in that market. How is that looking...
Christopher J. Nassetta: I would say that is certainly what we would hope. San Francisco with Moscone has obviously had a bit of a cooling off, still relatively strong, I mean still growing as faster, faster than any of the other major markets in the country, but instead of growing 10%, it's growing half of that this year, as we maybe a little higher than that as we look into next year, given that we do have a lot of meeting space, we do think and we do have a pretty good Group position. We do think we can take advantage of in-house Groups and continue if everything – all else being equal with the broader economic setup, we do think we can continue to drive pretty good performance there.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then finally...
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, and I'd just add, Smedes, that San Francisco doesn't have any new supply to speak of and so then that makes it a little bit easier too and I think that the issues at Moscone are becoming better known. And I think they're working with the city to know when they're going to be in and when they're going to be out, so you can just do a little bit better. So as Chris said, probably not going to be gangbusters, but we think San Fran will be okay next year.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then, fair to say that the case of unit addition should accelerate through the back half in order to reach your – I think you said 45,000 net adds for the year expected?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. And that's not atypical. I mean, if you look at the numbers year-to-date, we're ahead on signings, we're ahead on construction starts, and we're ahead on net unit growth relative to last year, it is not unusual that the second half of the year is heftier in terms of deliveries than the first half of the year. So, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we've given; the third quarter should be a banner quarter for openings.
Smedes Rose: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.
David Loeb: Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning.
David Loeb: I know you talked a little bit about the direct booking earlier today, at least I've been told that. If you don't mind, just a little deeper into that...
Christopher J. Nassetta: Nobody was on the call, I thought, people heard the – anyway, we'll have – you can get the transcript.
David Loeb: I will get the transcript. I didn't manage to get on, but the rest...
Christopher J. Nassetta: Okay. So sorry, we had a small problem with AT&T. Yes.
David Loeb: Yes. Apparently they had a lot of problems. That's fine. But just to go a little deeper into the direct booking initiative. Can you give us a little bit of color on what you think the trade-off has been in terms of what's happened to ADR versus the savings for owners, in terms of the customer acquisition cost, the booking cost?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. Yes, I mean I think, at a high level, the way to think about our book direct campaign is, it's pretty simple, it's really to make sure that we're delivering to our customers the best value and the best overall experience. And we think, by having a more direct relationship with them, we are able to do that. And we also realize that we can't have a direct relationship with absolutely every customer. And so, in those cases, we certainly want to work with other intermediaries, including the OTAs, but where we can have a direct relationship and make sure they get the best value and give them all of the other things, HHonors, benefits and digital check-in and Digital Key and all those things, we think ultimately it's a better value and better experience for them. So, we've gone on this campaign, and the one thing I want to note, that I have said on prior calls that's really important is, this is going to be – this is a long-term strategy, this isn't a flash in the pan, we're going out and doing a stop-clicking-around campaign. That's the beginning of years of effort and initiative to really evolve HHonors as a club to better serve our customers and to continue to bring more people into a very direct relationship with us. We think, if you look at the stats, when you read the transcript – sorry about that – you'll see we're having great success. I think at a high level, you look at what's going on with HHonors membership, up 80% year-over-year. You look at the channel shift that's occurring to our direct channels from other channels, particularly the OTAs, all at the same time gaining market share, okay? So, you put all that together, I'd say we're having very good success, but it's early days clearly, this just really kicked off in February, March. It's going to go on for years. We're going to have to stay very vigilant, again, with the objective, giving our customers the best value and the best experience. In terms of our owner community, and obviously you can speak with them. I'd say broadly, our owner community is, to say they're supportive would be an understatement. I think our owner community is incredibly focused on these issues and distribution costs and ultimately are having a more direct relationship with our customers. They have been very, very supportive, as a group, of all of our initiatives, and I believe that they are benefiting from it. If you look at it the way that we have to look at it, which is what's going on with – on a net rate basis, if you look at what's going on as a consequence of the channel shift that has occurred to our direct channels, on a net rate basis, our owners across the board, in every segment of our transient distribution, are doing better on a net rate basis, because even though, with HHonors discounts, which vary depending on day of the week and forward time, et cetera, but always there is some discount to HHonors members because they shift our channels and the cost of our channels, particularly our app, are de minimis relative to the other channels. On a net rate basis, our owners are making out in a big way. As this continues, if we're successful, and we certainly plan to be, I think the net rate benefit is going to accelerate, and that is the objective. So I think everybody is – our ownership community is quite supportive. I'm sure like anything, you could find somebody that's not, but I think we're really focused on this. They for years, together with us, have been focused on making sure that we have good strategies in place, to make sure that our distribution costs are reasonable.
David Loeb: So, just to follow that up, I do appreciate the comments about the net rate, that's kind of where I was going. If the HHonors' share of occupancy is 56% now, what's the sort of theoretical limit, or the optimal, for where that can go?
Christopher J. Nassetta: The higher, the better. I don't think there is any reasonable limit. I think if we do our job over time, HHonors should be a club for everybody. HHonors should be a club for those that are frequent travelers, those who are infrequent travelers. Obviously, the more frequently you travel, the more benefits you may get, but there should be benefits to all travelers and I think we could have a much, much higher share of overall occupancy than in the mid-50%s ultimately. But again, I want to reinforce that I am absolutely happy to talk about this and should talk about it every quarter. We're going to be talking about this for years. This is not going to be like a quarter or two quarters and okay, that's over. This is a long-term strategy that our company has.
David Loeb: Okay. That's great. And finally, look, not for your fault for the technical issues, not holding you accountable.
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'm holding Christian accountable for the record.
David Loeb: Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, David.
Operator: And the next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore. Please go ahead.
Richard Allen Hightower: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Sure.
Richard Allen Hightower: So, just to go back to the spin transactions for one second here. I think previously whether on these calls or offline calls, you guys had mentioned potentially doing some opportunistic capital transactions in advance of this. So, just I'm wondering if you could add any color to what those might be. And just any additional detail would be helpful.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not in a position to give you a whole lot more detail at this point, Rich. I'd repeat what we said before which is we're in a position thankfully where we don't have to do any financings to accomplish the spins, though, we may very well want to opportunistically particularly given the strength for the debt market. And we are considering a whole bunch of options right now. And when we have more detail, we'll obviously get back with you.
Richard Allen Hightower: All right. Thanks, Chris. That's it from me.
Operator: The next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow: Hey. Good afternoon, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Hey, Bill.
Bill A. Crow: Christian is always to blame, I think. Chris, three very quick topics hopefully, following up I think it was Joe's question earlier on the development pipeline and then whether you've seen any impact. Do you guys measure the time that elapses between signings and actual construction start? And has there been any change in that over the last year or two years?
Christopher J. Nassetta: We do measure that and it has extended a little bit, but that's been more, if I look at the granular data, it's a lot more to do with China than anything, lot of the big projects in China that are in the pipeline, even some that are under construction. They're just slowing, just the pace is slowing. There are not as many workers on the sites. They are just taking longer to get it done and you've seen more delays. I'd say outside of that, not a whole heck of a lot of difference than the last year.
Bill A. Crow: Okay. And then, I know, Chris, you're really involved on the government relations front in marketing for the industry. And lately, the headline seemed to point to momentum shifting against your B&B, just wondering if you had any thoughts on that topic?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not anything particularly new. I think all the headlines do a reasonable job of covering. And I think the industry's perspective, if I were to encapsulate it is that just having sort of a fair set of rules that apply to everybody, and I think that's a belief that's held by many of the municipalities around the country. And like a lot of the sharing economy companies that are out there, the rules and regulations haven't really kept up. They are moving faster than many of the government entities, both locally and federally can move. And so, I do think over time you're going to find that those two – that the government side of it catches up with it and ultimately that you have sort of balanced rules and regulations that apply to businesses that have similar attributes. So, I think you're going to see, I mean, Airbnb is a real business, a good business is going to be around, they are obviously growing very rapidly, I think, increasingly you are going to see either by self governance or otherwise, that the set of rules that they are playing by are going to look more like the set of rules that we play by.
Bill A. Crow: All right. And then finally, Chris, I know special corporate negotiated rate businesses is just a part of overall corporate demand, but there were several companies saying that last fall's negotiations were as good as they have been for the cycle and here we are with a real void in corporate demand. So, two-part question, are we making more of that negotiating period than we should be as even material? And number two, are we entering this fall negotiation period at more of a position of weakness?
Christopher J. Nassetta: We've been talking a lot about that because we are talking to our sales teams about the discussion that's going to start to hit in the high gear late summer or early fall. I think, you can interpret everything we said about weakness in demand in that space, while special corporates are maybe 20%.
Kevin J. Jacobs: 10%.
Christopher J. Nassetta: 10%.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes.
Christopher J. Nassetta: 20% of that corporate business, so 10% of the overall business, it's meaningful, it's not as big I think it ultimately is as people think. I do think in a weaker environment, it's going to be tougher to push rates and, I think, if last year, we were all sort of in the mid-single digits and pushing above frankly, our objectives were mid-single digits to high single digits. I think, it's this year, likely we are not there, but likely going to be in the low single digits to mid-single digits, that's where sort of rationally, I think, we can expect to be. We will see. It's not going to really get going in earnest until September, October. We'll see what's going on in the broader macro environment to see if things have picked up a bit, but I think, 3% to 5% would be a rational expectation, with what I see sitting here today.
Bill A. Crow: Thanks for the time. Appreciate it.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.
Vince Ciepiel: Hi. Two questions on RevPAR. First, it looks like occupancy swung positive, which I think was in line with your commentary on the prior call. Curious what the full year move from 3% to 5% to 2% to 4%, is that more driven by rates or occupancy? And then second...
Christopher J. Nassetta: It's almost all rate. I mean, we did flip back around on occupancy and, I think, our actual forecast show a tiny amount of occupancy, but it's almost all rate, so almost a 90%-plus rate in the guidance we've given you.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks. And then, second, for your second half RevPAR outlook, would you expect international or North America to lead RevPAR growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I would say that when you blend it all together, I haven't done the math in my head, it's probably going to be comparable, simply because international, you've got the Asia Pacific that will clearly lead the world with continuing relative strength in China, and still in Japan, while Japan's cooled off a bit, it's still relatively strong. You're going to see Europe, you know, weaker, you are going to see Middle East/Africa weaker, so when you blend strong Asia with weaker other regions against America, my guess is, it could be about the same, I mean we could do a little bit more refined math, but I think that's plus or minus, what I would say.
Vince Ciepiel: Okay. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. I just wanted to focus on fee growth, particularly the IMFs in the quarter and kind of how that fits into the overall M&F guidance for the year. So given that, that the quarter as you just mentioned was mainly rates versus occupancy, and that's kind of the outlook for the second half of the year, and given that Asia was strong where there is most likely no owner's priority, curious why M&Fs were flat in the second quarter and then second part of that, should we expect for this line item to kind of re-accelerate above base and franchise fees as we have seen it in the past? Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, I think the short answer is yes, but let me give you a little bit more detail. First of all, remember for us that IMF is only 10% of the fee base, so not as big as you might find with other of our competitors which we like because IMF obviously by its very nature is a higher beta income stream. The reason you saw it flat in Q2 had to do with one-time stuff year-over-year. I think we would expect for the full year, it would be growing faster than base, certainly base and even core franchise fees. I think on an FX neutral basis, current expectation is for low teens, which is a little bit lower than where we've been, but that's because the bulk of that 10% IMF is in the international states and some of the places that have been more impacted by some of the things going on around the world. So, full year expectation, FX neutral, low teens, which is obviously – and they could have a higher growth rate than what you are seeing in the core fee base.
Chad Beynon: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: The next question will come from Jared Shojaian of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
Jared Shojaian: Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just broadly on supply, and obviously your pipeline growth looks pretty good here, but we're also seeing sort of similar growth from everyone else, and yesterday Starwood showed a pretty big spike. So my question is, how will this not result in an overall industry supply problem as we go forward? And what are you expecting for industry growth here in the U.S. for next year and into 2018?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. I mean, again, the prepared comments, which evidently not many people heard, but you can read. I think part of what's going on is, our development pipeline's picking up, but we are fighting way over our weight. Can't really speak to Starwood in any detail, but I'd say, relative to almost all the competition, with one notable exception, we are getting a disproportionate share of the development. We've got 25% of the rooms under construction are our brands in the United States, where we have 11% market share. So, part of what's going on is, the stronger brands are getting a disproportionate share of the development, which means you are in a nice place where you are not having a huge amount of supply, that's why you are still in the 1%s, but yet we can have really significant growth as a company, given the strength of these brands and the market share of these brands at the same time. Expectations for next year, I think, if you look at consensus numbers, we are going to be this year, 1.7%, 1.8%. I think as you get into next year, its gets up to about 2%, 2.1% if I blend the consensus and obviously, we'd tick up above that. A 30-year average is 2.5%, and while you are going to be next year, starting in 2017 and 2018, you're going to get to and probably hit the longer-term average, my guess is, some people say 2017, I think the number's actually – traditionally come in lower than expectations. I think it's maybe late 2017, 2018. I would note that, in no time in my experience have we had a – first of all, even when the supply has been two times and three times and four times those levels, has it been really supply that has driven the turn of a cycle, it's always really been demand, obviously supply being at high levels can accentuate that. But I don't think getting into the 2%s and low 2%s is, in and of itself, necessarily a problem. I've said this 1000 times probably, and I'd say it again, I think when people want to think about, when will the cycle turn? I think it is entirely going to be driven by the business cycle turn. So when you think the overall economy is going to go into a cyclical decline, I think that is what ultimately is going to drive a decline in the lodging cycle. I don't personally believe supply levels are going to get to a level, I mean, is it better for the number to be lower, of course, like the math, the laws of economics are alive and well, but high 1%s and low 2%s, I don't think are particularly problematic.
Jared Shojaian: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will be from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, afternoon, all.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Afternoon.
David Katz: I suppose everyone's apologized enough in both directions for repetition, so if I'm raising an issue you have discussed, let's put it in that bucket. But when I came in this morning and I read through your release, I then went back and read your transcript from the first quarter call. And it is quite a bit more bullish about the remainder of the year. And I suppose what I have not really captured so far is what changed, and clearly it's closer in business or expectations of such, but if you could just talk about what has shifted since that April 27 call, I'd appreciate it.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, I'd be happy too, David, and I think it's three very straightforward things. One, what we've delivered year-to-date. We're now more than half done with the year, we've reported second quarter but we have very good visibility now into July, and decent visibility into August. So in April, we didn't have all that visibility. We've delivered 2.5% year-to-date. We had hoped, and if you read that transcript you would find, we had seen some, I'd say threads of improvement. I think I may have used those words with the business transient segment. When we pulled those threads, they didn't lead to rope, meaning we haven't really seen a meaningful uptick, which I've talked about a bunch of times. So we had hoped we'd start to see a little bit more of an uptick sooner. I ultimately think it has to come, if the economy is strengthening, but we haven't seen it yet and we have a lot of the year now behind us. And then, a bunch of things in the world have gone on since then, Brexit, coups in Turkey, the strengthening of the Japanese yen, terrorist events in multiple locations around the world, all of which, net-net, are not the end of the world necessarily, but they're all sort of a net drag. And when you put sort of the corporate transient not picking up year-to-date and things going on around the world together, it's how you get to the outlook that we've described.
David Katz: All right. Thank you. And if I can just sort of follow that up particularly around that last point, because we discussed the notion of sort of geopolitical issues and so forth. Does it appear that any one of these events has had more of an impact than any of the others, or is it, I'm sure there is an appropriate metaphor that we can come up with each one adds just a little bit more drag on the system.
Christopher J. Nassetta: I would say the latter.
David Katz: Right. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. Yes.
Operator: And the next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Hello, everyone. Wanted to look at the corporate travel, the one thing that stands out, as you look at the demand for these upscale hotels, it's up almost 500 basis points year-to-date. Are they less exposed to the corporate travel customer? Are they pulling share from the full service hotels? What are your thoughts on why demand has been so strong for that category other than the fact that they had increased...
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think it's simply in a somewhat weaker environment more of a value proposition. And I probably wouldn't complicate it beyond that.
Wes Golladay: Okay. And then by geography are you noticing any regions that are having at least decent corporate travel, I imagine the Texas area may have a little bit weakness due to the energy segment exposure and maybe Northeast from the financial services...
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. I'd say the one, I mean probably the bright spots, the West Coast and the much less bright spot would be the oil patch, sort of energy patch. But otherwise, not notable exceptions.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Operator: And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Well, thank you, everybody, for the time today. One last apology, again, sorry for messing up everybody's day. For those of you, who didn't and I think there are lot of you hear our prepared comments, thankfully you can read those. We look forward to catching up with you after the third quarter and obviously we'll be giving you incremental information on the spins as the quarter plays out. So, hope everybody has a great day. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-04-28 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Holdings First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Christian Charnaux, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide first quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our most recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our Web-site at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the Company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our first quarter results and provide greater details on our expectations for the remainder of the year. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thank you, Christian. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report first quarter performance in line with our expectations, driven by growth across all three of our businesses. We've also made great progress on the initiatives that we discussed last quarter, including the spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses as well as our initiatives to strengthen our direct relationship with customers, both of which I'll update you on in just a few minutes. As we discussed on our last call, we believe fundamentals will support solid top line growth this year. The best visibility we have on the demand side continues to be in the group business segment, which remains healthy. We have less visibility in the transient demand which makes up the largest portion of our business and historically tracks more closely with macro indicators such as GDP growth. Within transient, we continue to see relative strength in leisure, with softer corporate business driven by weaker macro conditions. We did see strong U.S. booking pace across all segments and channels in-the-month, for-the-month of April, particularly in corporate transient. Looking forward, consensus forecasts are for full-year U.S. GDP growth to be modestly lower than last year at plus or minus 2%, with Q2 through Q4 meaningfully stronger than Q1. As a result, we are maintaining our 2016 RevPAR growth expectations of 3% to 5% which assumes U.S. GDP growth of roughly 1.5% to 2.5% for the year, and we're also maintaining our adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. While we expect to continue capitalizing on these positive fundamentals, we also remain very focused on driving value beyond what the broader economy gives us. Our distinct high-quality brands with global presence create a powerful network effect, driving greater value for our customers and hotel owners alike. As a result, Hilton has led the industry in both market share premiums and organic net unit growth as a percentage of installed base for the past several years, a trend we expect to continue. We signed a record 100,000 rooms in 2015 and are on track to top that in 2016 with 26,000 rooms approved for development in the first quarter. With nearly 1.1 million rooms open or under development, including nearly 300,000 rooms in the pipeline, we maintained our No. 1 position in global supply, active pipeline and rooms under construction according to Star. More importantly, our net unit growth continues to accelerate off a larger base of rooms, with 45,000 to 50,000 net rooms expected to join our system in 2016, a 10% increase year-over-year at the midpoint. Nearly 25% of the more than 1,700 hotels in our pipeline will fly flags of brands that did not exist seven years ago. At no material cost to us, we have organically developed carefully targeted new brands that further strengthen our network effect by bringing new customers into our system and offering more opportunities for existing customers to stay with us. We launched our latest brand, Tru by Hilton, in the mid-scale space just three months ago with 130 deals committed or in process, and since that time we have averaged one Tru deal per day. As of today, we have 48 hotels in the pipeline and 170 more deals committed or in progress, and that's driven almost entirely by existing Hampton owners. We believe Tru is already the fastest growing new development brand launched in U.S. lodging history and we expect to open development more broadly in the near term including to owners not currently in the Hilton system. The ebbs and flows of capital markets continue to naturally constrain supply growth disproportionately favoring global branded systems like ours that can drive leading returns for hotel owners. New brands like Tru, Home2, Canopy and Curio help supercharge our growth but we continue to have tremendous opportunities ahead following demand and capital patterns around the world with all of our brands. Outside the U.S. in particular which represents more than half of our pipeline, we believe we are in the infancy of our potential growth. Deploying our brands into new geographies like Hampton into China or DoubleTree into Europe made up nearly one-third of our gross openings over the last 12 months. We have global scale in a business where scale matters and are using it to drive a more direct relationship with all of our customers. In February, we launched 'Stop Clicking Around', our largest global marketing campaign ever, highlighting the key customer benefits of our network effect and its scale, namely that joining Hilton HHonors and booking directly with Hilton offers customers the best value and a better experience. Early results are very positive with HHonors enrolments increasing nearly 90% since launch, helping drive HHonors occupancy to a record 55% in the quarter, an increase of more than 4 points versus last year. The business we've received through Web Direct is higher than it's ever been and is growing faster than ever, thanks to increasing share shift. The share of Web Direct channels in our distribution mix is growing 5x that of the OTA share growth in the quarter, and business generated from our mobile app is up nearly 150% year-over-year with downloads exceeding 70,000 a week, an increase of 200% over last year. One of the most important metrics of our success is RevPAR index premiums. We continued to gain share in the quarter with our system increasing its RevPAR index premium 90 basis points with every brand in every region gaining market share. Lastly, a quick update on the spins we announced last quarter. As discussed, simplifying Hilton as a capital-light fee-based business while fully activating our real estate and timeshare businesses as stand-alone companies should realize significant benefits for all three companies and our shareholders. We're very pleased with the progress on the spins to date and remain on track to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC this quarter and to execute the spins by year end. Also this morning, we were very pleased to announce the leadership team for our real estate company with Tom Baltimore as CEO and Sean Dell'Orto as CFO. I'm thrilled that Tom, a respected leader in our sector with experiences spanning REIT, private equity and operating companies, including senior roles at both Hilton and Marriott, will be leading the REIT. I've known Tom for 30 years and believe his proven leadership and track record as a capital allocator should further the company's potential to create meaningful value for shareholders over the long term. We're also giving up one of our best and brightest with Sean moving over to REIT as Chief Financial Officer. As many of you know, Sean currently serves as Hilton's Treasurer and has been integral in our corporate strategy, capital markets and investor relations activities since joining us in 2010 including our IPO. Sean joined us from Crestline Hotels & Resorts where he was CFO. We look forward to partnering with Tom and Sean in their new roles. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin who will give you a little bit more detail on the quarter. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. First quarter RevPAR growth of 2.1% was at the low end of our guidance range, largely reflecting lower macroeconomic growth in the quarter and a larger than expected impact from the Easter calendar shift. Weakness in corporate transient demand was a 60 basis point drag on total occupancy for the quarter, but we still expect modest occupancy growth for the full year. Transient RevPAR grew 2.4% in the quarter. Results were supported by solid leisure revenue trends that were up in the mid-single-digits, but offset by weaker corporate transient and oil and gas markets which were down nearly 5%. As Chris mentioned, we have seen stabilization in corporate transient so far in April with solid in-the-month for-the-month increases in pace. Group business in the quarter continued to perform in line with expectations, with group room revenue increasing nearly 4% in our Americas owned and managed portfolio and over 15% at our big six assets in what is a seasonally slow group quarter. Results were led by robust performance at our Hawaiian and San Francisco properties and boosted by strong bookings in the smurf and company meeting segments. Even more importantly, group position for Americas owned and managed hotels continues to track up in the mid-single-digits and pace in-the-year for-the-year was up in the high single digits during the first quarter, driven by both volume and rate. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased to $653 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range, driven by solid results across all three of our businesses and including roughly $10 million of favorable timing items in timeshare. System-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased a solid 260 basis points versus the prior period to 38.9%. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items increased 42% for the quarter to $0.17, at the high end of our guidance range. Turning to our segments, Management and Franchise beat expectations totaling $409 million in the quarter, an increase of nearly 5% year-over-year. Our fee segment growth rate was affected by some large franchise sales transactions during Q1 of last year. In the Ownership segment, RevPAR grew 3.1% in the quarter as growth was tempered by softer demand in Chicago and New York and supported by strong RevPAR growth in San Francisco, Orlando and Hawaii, which all benefited from strong group trends. Adjusted EBITDA for the Ownership segment was $207 million, up 13% versus Q1 2015 when adjusted for the sale of the Hilton Sydney. Timeshare revenues totaled $326 million in the quarter, increasing 2% year-over-year as we lapped strong sales from the Grand Islander project in Waikiki last year. Segment adjusted EBITDA was $95 million in the quarter, an increase of 28%, which was driven by favorable sales mix and resort operations results. We continue to make progress on our ongoing shift to a capital efficient business with third-party intervals increasing to 64% of intervals sold for the quarter and accounting for 85% of our inventory or 110,000 units. Now turning to our regional performance and outlook, in the U.S., comparable RevPAR grew 1.8% in the quarter. Hawaii and Northern California markets were strong with RevPAR growth in the high single digits, driven by rate gains across all segments. Reduced city-wides continued to affect Chicago while oil markets struggled with weaker demand and increasing supply in New York continued to weigh on pricing power. International inbound revenues declined in the quarter continuing late 2015 trends as weak demand from Canada and Brazil failed to offset increases from China, the U.K. and Japan. We expect this softness to continue but have less of an impact as comps get easier in the back half of the year. For full year 2016, we continue to forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the low to mid single digits. In the Americas outside of the U.S., RevPAR rose 4.4% in the quarter. Although Brazil remained an overhang on the region given a deepening recession and weakening currency, the Olympics this summer should provide a much-needed boost in demand. Our Latin American properties continued to perform well given a broader strengthening in leisure trends. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect RevPAR growth in the region to be mid-single-digits. RevPAR in Europe increased 2.9% in the first quarter, supported by strong market share gains of 230 basis points. Continental Europe performed well with strong transient group demand particularly across Germany and Prague. The U.K., namely London, remained soft and security concerns continued to pressure our results in Turkey. The tragic events in Brussels had a local effect on business but have not meaningfully affected regional performance. For full-year 2016, we continue to expect low to mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the European region. The Middle East and Africa region struggled with RevPAR down 4.7% in the quarter, given continued weakness in Egypt and depressed leisure demand in the UAE. With uncertainty in the region expected to continue weighing on results, our full-year 2016 RevPAR forecast assumes growth is flat to slightly down in the region. In the Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 7.1% in the quarter with continued strength in Japan and China, our largest regional markets. Business in Japan has been particularly strong, especially in Tokyo, and we have not seen a meaningful impact from the recent earthquakes. RevPAR growth in Greater China reaccelerated to 8% in the quarter as an uptick in group business across key cities drove occupancy gains. We also saw strength in Taiwan, Singapore, India and Malaysia. We expect RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid to high single digits for the year with RevPAR in China up 5% to 6%. Moving on to capital allocation, during the first quarter we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share. Our Board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share for the second quarter of 2016 as well. We remain committed to achieving a low investment grade credit profile and still expect to initiate a stock buyback program subsequent to the execution of our spin transactions, which we expect to complete later this year. As Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our full-year 2016 RevPAR growth guidance of 3% to 5% and also are maintaining our full-year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance ranges. Please note that our full-year guidance does not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spins. For the second quarter of 2016, we expect 3% to 5% system-wide RevPAR growth supported by stabilizing macro trends and the Easter shift. We expect adjusted EBITDA of between $790 million and $810 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.25 to $0.27. Further details on our first quarter results can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. As a reminder, we unfortunately cannot provide many additional details on the proposed spins until we file Form 10 registration statements, which we still expect to occur later this quarter. In addition to the filings, we also expect to provide additional information on the strategy and financial performance of all three companies prior to the execution of the spins. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
William A. Crow: Congratulations on the hires on the REIT side, that's great. Chris, my question is on guidance and the range that you provided, we appreciate you provided any guidance, but 3% to 5%, given the first quarter and the outlook for the second quarter, to hit the high end would imply something north of 6% for the back half of the year, and I'm just curious whether that's even possible at this point given some of the dynamics around the industry?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Bill, thanks for the question. I assumed we would get that first and probably second, third, fourth and fifth as well because I know that's what's on everybody's mind, is trying to get a little color. So let me try and give you that color and maybe answer some other questions that are likely to come up. I think that what we tried to triangulate around what we are seeing both in the business now and what we see on a forward-looking basis where we do have sight lines and try to match it up with a perspective on and an expectation on broader economic growth, and that's why we connected the 3% to 5% to 1.5% to 2.5% broader GDP growth because obviously the largest part of our business which is the corporate transient business is fairly directly related to broader economic growth. And so while first quarter obviously in the low 2s is below the range in 3% to 5% that we're giving, the confidence we have in the 3% to 5% is based really on three different things, okay. One is a little bit of the reverse of the Easter effect. I'm not going to say that that's tremendously dramatic but that's a benefit. The second is that as I said in our – and Kevin said in the prepared comments, we have a very good group position on the books for the rest of the year. For the full year the numbers are quite healthy, but that is distributed, as is always the case, every quarter is a little bit different every year depending on how that group cycled through a lot of the big hotels, in this particular year the way it's distributed is, across the system Q1 is actually quite weak, was quite weak from a group position point of view and Q2, Q3 and Q4 are much stronger with particularly a little bit heavier strength in Q2 and Q3, reasonably good numbers in Q4, a little less than Q2 and Q3. So we have a much stronger group base coming into Q2 through Q4 which we think will help. The other thing is, and this gets back to the broader economic growth issue, if you think about what's been going on with corporate transient which is what's been really weak because leisure has been strong and driving the results in the fourth quarter and frankly in the first quarter that were a bit lower than what we would have hoped or expected, it had to do with the fact that the world froze up. I mean you had things going on with fears of what was going to happen with China's economy, terrorism in Paris, terrorism in Brussels and other things going on that drove the capital markets, the equity capital markets downward. Companies were losing 20%, 30% of their equity market cap. Well, you know that scares people. There was a lot of fear in the air at the end of last year and certainly the first couple of months of this year, and the result of that, and we saw it very dramatically, was people freezed. They stopped making decisions on discretionary spending, on travel, on CapEx spend, and the result is the economic growth numbers come down. I think when you see the print on Q1, it's going to be quite low and that rippled through to our business. So what's different? In addition to the group and the reversal of the Easter effect, why do I feel like 3% to 5% is reasonable for the full-year and for Q2? It's because I sort of told you, as I say it to our guys, the great thaw is on, meaning the world is not – make no mistake, I'm not trying to be a Pollyanna – the world is not, there are things going on in the world that aren't great, but relative to what we saw at the end of last year and the first couple of months of this year, there's a heck of a lot more stability. The equity markets obviously have come back. Valuations not just in our industry but broadly have come back. And I'd say there is an air about stability and that ultimately I think translates into more economic growth. Certainly to get to a 2% sort of consensus for GDP off of what I think will be very low numbers in the first quarter, it anticipates Q2 through Q4 being a lot better. That is what we believe will happen all things being equal, meaning that the stability that exists today are relative to stability continues. Do we have any sight lines into that? Some, I mean I talked about group which continues not only to be good in terms of position but pace is good. So we see the first quarter pace of group bookings for the rest of the year have been very healthy of late. April feels pretty darn good, okay, and certainly relative to what we experienced in the first quarter. And why is it better in April? Because corporate business is coming back. Now that's not a huge dataset admittedly. You're looking at not even a full month of data. But there is the beginning in my mind of a trend. So that's a long-winded way of saying that if you think that you're going to get through a broader growth number that is around consensus, it by definition means that you're going to see some better things happening in the business. Now obviously 3% to 5% growth is not – we're not suggesting we're going back to 2014 type transient growth numbers or the first half of last year. It's obviously the growth is somewhat more tempered than that, but we do believe, again all things being equal for these three primary reasons, that you're going to see performance in Q2 through Q4 that is superior to Q1 performance.
Kevin J. Jacobs: As it relates to the high-end, you know that's why we gave you a range. So you would have to believe – I agree, you would have to believe that broader economic growth is meaningfully above consensus to get that, but that's why we gave a range. We assumed that we are forecasting somewhere in the midpoint of our range and we've given you a range of outcomes if the economy and broader growth is lower or higher.
William A. Crow: Appreciate the insights. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Steven Kent: Two questions. First is the $9 million in costs that were incurred from the spin-offs in the first quarter 2016, how much should we start to put into our models for the remainder of the year, just general numbers? I know they are extraordinary but I just want to have some sense for what that's going to look like. And then separately, I mean you continue to show very strong margin growth. I just want to understand the balance of the shift towards asset-light, more franchising, more management versus the opportunity to reduce expense structure at the owned hotels and what initiatives do you have on both sides of those to improve the margins?
Christopher J. Nassetta: On the first, unfortunately I'm not going to satisfy your need there. We're going to have a lot of information that we're going to – we're just around the bend from filing the Form 10 that will give you a much better sense of what we think and supplemental information ultimately that will give you a much better sense of the cost. So if you could just wait a teeny amount of additional time, I think we'll give you some clarity on that. We'd rather do it in a more complete way as we give disclosures on both companies. On the margin side, obviously yes, we're growing margins in all three businesses. Going forward, all three of those businesses, as we get to the spins, are going to be doing that as independent companies. One of the things I'd talk about here is, and I understand why the market seems to be exceptionally focused on top line, everything is about top line, we don't get a lot of questions on margins and bottom line, so I appreciate it because we're running a very big global complex business and it starts at the top line but driving cost and margins to get it to the bottom line which I think frankly we've done quite an effective job not just in this quarter but for years and years while we've been public and while we've been private, I honestly don't think gets sort of enough attention or discussion. Probably on the limits of time on this call, it would be hard to go into all of those initiatives. I mean part of the margin growth is obviously coming from the really industry-leading growth that we're getting on the new unit side and continuing to see all of the new units coming-in in the Management and Franchise segment where essentially those are 100% margin business additions, but on the Timeshare side, as you'll see as we break that business apart, you'll see in the Form 10, we have done a tremendous amount of work there to drive what I believe are industry-leading margins by just being much more efficient on how we sell and distribute the product. And then inside the hotels, we have hundreds of initiatives that are going on all the time on the labor side, labor management side, making sure we're driving efficiency in every way possible on procurement, et cetera. So there is a constantly evolving but long list of things that we're doing in the hotels. I think it's fair to say we are exceptionally focused not just on driving top line but cost, and ultimately we are running the whole business and trying to drive margins as high as we can to get as much EBITDA to the bottom line as possible.
Operator: The next question will come from Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis: I've been getting a reasonable number of questions on the topic of the Marriott-Starwood merger and its potential impact on Hilton and whether or not it puts you at a competitive disadvantage. So I wonder if you could take a minute and give us your thoughts on what circumstances that might be right and then where it misses the mark?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'm happy to answer it in some ways. I don't want to get snarky about what our competitors are doing. I think the way to think about it is that we have chosen a path proactively which is a different path than others, including them have taken, and that started with the fact that we did not get involved in the process of when Starwood last summer put themselves in play, and that was related to the fact that as we looked at it and we looked at what our opportunity was, we were very focused on having purebred brands that were market segment leaders in their individual segments, that were category killers and that each of our individual existing brands we wanted to be described that way, and any individual brand that we might add to the system, and we obviously have had a number, we wanted to fall in that category. And as a result to drive the highest market share by brand, the highest average market share, which ultimately we thought and think will drive, as a result of resonating with customers, will drive the highest organic growth, and we chose not to want to have the distractions that would come with doing something like that. And I think if you look at our numbers and what we're driving in terms of organic growth, as I said in my prepared comments, we've been leading the industry for the last several years, I think we'll continue to lead the industry, and I think what we're focused on is making sure that every brand we have really resonates with customers and with owners and that we continue to drive that growth and I think that sort of the story. In terms of scale, I said in my comments, we are in a business where scale matters and we think we have enough scale. I think my attitude, our attitude at this point when you have existing system and pipeline that's 1.1 million rooms, we're big enough and we're in the game of quality at this size as opposed to quantity.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Vince Ciepiel: I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more on supply growth. It seems like your pipeline continues to act nicely. Could you comment on what products specifically you think are adding to that? And then also, could you maybe speak to as you think about supply growth over the next couple of years, any natural suppressors that you're starting to see come into place that could put a ceiling on supply growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta: First, thanks for the question, and an important one as well. I think there already is a natural ceiling on supply growth. I mean it is creeping up a little bit but it's still well below long-term averages and I suspect will be lower than people think as it has been the last couple of years when the year is out. It's going to be somewhere in my mind between 1.5% and 1.75% against the 2.5% long-term average. So I think very much in check, and I think the reason that it's in check is really simple and that is, while there is capital available, it's limited amounts of capital, and the basic economics only support a certain amount of development and largely what you would find is that is in the limited service space. We happen to have in my mind the best limited service brands out there. So from the standpoint of what we're seeing product-wise, it's all as described or a little bit as described in my prepared comments. Now Tru with our new brand, Home2, Homewood, Hilton Garden Inn, Hampton, that's the large majority certainly in the U.S. of what we see getting done largely in secondary and tertiary markets. Why is that getting done? Two reasons. That's where the economics make sense where demand growth is heavy enough, where pricing structures and cost to build makes sense so owners can get the economics. And why are we getting disproportionately 2.5x our existing system size in the U.S.? There is a simple reason. Our brands are strong enough, market share is strong enough that while there is limited financing, we are getting a disproportionate amount of that financing. So I've said it before, we're sort of in a sweet spot for us which is there are some pretty decent natural constraints on supply, but yet we're getting a disproportionate share of what's available to get done because we're one of the most financeable and we're driving the best economics for owners so they want to continue to invest with us.
Vince Ciepiel: Great, thanks. And then maybe another big picture question. I think that you mentioned that you guys expect occupancy to swing positive for the year. If you look in the quarter, you have occupancy slightly down and somewhat more modest rate growth. When you think back over historical cycles and kind of where we are within a hotel that's relatively full, do you need occupancy to swing positive for rate to accelerate from the first quarter level or is it something else that could cause rate to accelerate, maybe confidence or something like that?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, I don't think you need occupancy. I think you're going to see the vast majority of RevPAR growth in the industry and certainly for us be rate at this point and then that's what you would expect at this point. We've been saying that this would come for the last couple of years. I think the reason we think – first of all, first quarter if you just neutralize for the Easter effect, would've been positive, a slightly positive occupancy growth. So I think it's just a reversal of that, a much stronger group base and some basic pick-up off a very weak corporate transient demand as I described in my first answer that's going to drive some modest occupancy growth. I don't think it's going to be big time occupancy growth. I think it's just sort of reversal of some of those three trends that drive more volume in the last three quarters of the year.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: One quick question on the Hilton flagship brand that I noticed just scanning the room count, it does look like the brand lost a handful of managed hotels in every region except for Asia-Pac but then there looks to be basically a one-for-one offset in the franchised segment. Can we assume those are basically the same hotels just converting to franchise agreements, and then is that a trend that we should expect to continue?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I don't think it's a major trend. I think it was one portfolio that we have in the U.K. in some of our leased estates that as we were restructuring some of that relationship, we flipped from managed to franchise. So I don't see it as a big trend. I think it was fairly unique to that transaction.
Rich Hightower: Okay, that's helpful, Chris. And then one quick follow-up, just on the outlook for energy markets, it does seem like the outlook for Houston and some other places might be incrementally better over the next 12 to 18 months given what may appear to be a bottoming in oil prices. Are you actually seeing any fundamental acceleration in demand in those markets or is it just a function of easy comps going forward?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not yet, not yet. I think you got two opportunities there. One, the comps get much, much easier really in third and fourth quarter. If you look at the dive in those markets last year, first quarter not so much, second quarter it started, third and fourth quarter was in full swing. So you're going to get much easier comps in those markets in Q3 and Q4. And you have to believe, although I will say, we haven't seen it yet that with oil prices off the bottom and moving back up, it will provide a little bit more of a stability on the demand side in those markets, but we'll have to wait and see that happen.
Rich Hightower: Right. Great. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Greff of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff: I have a question for you guys on your full-year 2016 guidance, and [indiscernible] with this, when I look back at the Q1 results, you hit the lower end of the range for RevPAR growth guidance, yet you were above the higher end of the EBITDA range or above the higher end of the EBITDA range. So when I look at the full-year guidance for 2016 at the lower end to the higher end of RevPAR growth, does that correspond exactly to the lower and higher end of EBITDA growth, i.e., if you hit the middle of the road in terms of RevPAR growth, are you something a little bit north of middle of the road for EBITDA growth?
Christopher J. Nassetta: That's a very fair question, Joe, given first quarter, and if we've done our job, those should match up. In the first quarter they didn't match up exactly, in part really to do with timing on some of the timeshare stuff that moved $10 million or $12 million from one quarter to the next. It would have otherwise generally been lined up. So our guidance on both EBITDA and RevPAR were intending to match up between low and high end.
Joseph R. Greff: Okay, great. Thank you. And then with respect to, Chris, your comments about April, and maybe I missed this, but did you actually talked about what April month-to-date RevPAR growth was and could you talk about it [indiscernible]?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I did not and I don't want to get into month-to-month too much, but here's what I'd say. Relative – April is trending sort of at or a little bit above the midpoint of our guidance for the quarter, so a lot better than Q1, and in the places that you want to see it, good group base but also corporate business coming back.
Joseph R. Greff: Good enough. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will be from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun C. Kelley: Chris, in the prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit about the 'Stop Clicking Around' campaign and some of the success you've had across the metrics. That's something that I think you are likely to probably hear more about as time goes forward. Could you give us a little perspective here, number one, how big is the direct booking channel for Hilton on their Web-sites and apps relative to the OTA channel? And then secondarily, where does the benefit here accrue, does it accrue to Hilton or is it really more of a pass-through to the owners but helps the brands in the long-term?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think it helps everybody. I think here's the underpinning of it, Shaun, is that we're trying to deliver the best value and best experience for our customers, and what Stop Clicking Around is really intended to do is in a fairly loud way admittedly make it clear to customers how they are going to have the best experience and where they are going to get the best value because I think not all customers really understand that, okay. So we're trying to put an exclamation point on it, and I think if you look at the stats early days, but if you look at the stats in the first quarter, I think it reflects that customers are getting it and that so far we're having very good success, but it's a long-term strategy and you definitely will hear more about it. In terms of what's the beneficiary of it, I think everybody benefits from it. In the end I think the customers benefit because they are going to get a better experience and they are going to get a better value. Clearly the system, all of our owners benefit because in the end it is a much more – not only do their customers end up happier because it's a better experience and they get a better value but they get that value at a lower cost because our direct channels are the most efficient way to distribute our product. And so, yes, the largest benefit is really going to flow through to the system, meaning all of our owners, and we are obviously very serious about not only driving market share at the highest levels as described in my prepared comments, to drive returns to owners and incremental growth for us but driving the best bottom line possible. The more that we can have a direct relationship with our customers, the more efficiently we can distribute our product and our owners' product, the better their returns are going to be, the happier they are going to be, the more hotels they're going to build into the system. In terms of percentages, I would say our direct channels are sort of a quarter of our business and growing at a very rapid pace. The OTAs are plus or minus kind of 10% of our business. So our direct channels are significantly larger than those channels, and as I described in my prepared comments, growing at this point at a much faster pace.
Shaun C. Kelley: And just to be clear, the direct channels are excluding property direct and call center, all that, this is just the web?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Correct. These are online. This is Hilton.com and the app, mobile and online.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: You mentioned that everything froze in the first quarter, yet easy comps in the second half. I think a big concern is the decelerating industry demand. Would you expect a V-shaped recovery or a steep acceleration in the industry demand in the second half?
Christopher J. Nassetta: That's hard to say. I mean I think you're going to see an acceleration in demand unless something else goes wrong. I think we're already starting to see the early signs of that. How to describe it as a V or U, I don't know. I'd probably describe it as U, but a long U. Again, I wasn't trying to suggest – I think it's very positive. I think we see great telltale signs that it's happening. I think just – I say to our guys here, common sense tells you it's going to happen because it wasn't just the beginning of this year, the end of last year we went into a deep freeze and we definitely have been witnessing a [sign] [ph] across the broader economy. That just have to ultimately drive incremental business. Exactly how much, it's hard to see. That's why we've been I think tried to be quite reasonable in giving a range of outcomes that are not suggesting a big steep V-shaped recovery but certainly a decent uptick from what we saw in Q4 on the corporate transient and Q1.
Operator: Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Question for you on the performance of the Hampton Inn brand. It definitely looked like it underperformed what I would have expected based on the Smith Travel results for the quarter, and that's your largest brand by room count. How do I reconcile that underperformance versus your commentary on gaining RevPAR index?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I don't know, I'd have to dig into it, Pat, to understand it more clearly. There's nothing going on I would say. It's been a lot of time with all of the brand heads on all of the brands. I can't say I've dissected the first quarter of Hampton but there's not a broader issue and in fact Hampton did gain market share in the system. So it could have to do with – the only thing I could guess is, when you're looking at Smith Travel data, we're comp and Smith Travel is non-comp. I'm not saying that's the answer, just I'd have to dig into it. I mean if you think about where all the new supply is coming in, it's in that segment and those are all ramping up when they come in new and it's a disproportionately large chunk of new supply. My guess is that probably explains it but I'm happy to work with our team and dig in a little bit more. We did gain share on a comp basis in the Hampton. Hampton is doing great. We're signing up owners. I'd say Hampton is one of the most successful brands and most desired brands that exist in this space with the ownership community.
Kevin J. Jacobs: We did gain share on all brands in the first quarter, but it's just varying degrees of share gain that blended to the nearly 100 basis points that we mentioned. And as Chris mentioned, you have independents and then you have non-comp hotels in the STR data. So you can get different answers on a quarter to quarter basis.
Patrick Scholes: Okay, fair enough. Can I ask one last completely unrelated follow-up question, and that's do you gentlemen care to take a stab at what you see RevPAR being for the months of May and June? I know you mentioned April already.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not really, no. I mean I really don't want to give the business forecasting by the month or trying to give color. I'll give you a little color though just based on what we see, it's a fair question by the way, Pat, I know you guys are looking for any forward-looking color and I would too. So I think it's fair rather than give you a number of exactly what our forecast is, what I would say is Q2 has a better group base. That group base is distributed overall more heavily in April and June than May and we've seen as I said in April a nice uptick in the corporate business. Our sightlines in the May and June, what we do have, suggest pretty decent trajectory on that basis if everything stays as I said sort of relatively stable in the world. And so I would expect that, again I said it earlier, we're kind of forecasting a range of 3% to 5%. That means we're hoping to be somewhere around the midpoint. I think it will be distributed with April and June being stronger than May, just in part because of the group base being so much stronger in April and particularly June.
Patrick Scholes: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: Considering the spin, I'm just curious, do you expect the leased hotels are going to stay with the brand or can they go to the REIT, and I guess in broad strokes, I know you can't be specific, how are you just thinking about the G&A load of the REIT? I'm curious if you think you could be more efficient in say [indiscernible].
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'd say on that, we're going to give you the Form 10 and you'll know where everything goes. But the overarching theory is we're trying to make all these companies really great companies and set them up for success. And so things that fit within the REIT you should assume are going to be in the REIT largely and things that don't would not. And so I think the sum and substance of the EBITDA related to leases will end up remaining an OpCo, both because it doesn't fit within the REIT structure really because most of that is international, and importantly in those parts of the world that's how we have our tenure in those assets. Many of which that drive the largest part of that EBITDA are very important strategic assets. So it makes sense for that to stay back in OpCo. Even though they'll be there, and you'll see when we do all the disclosures, it will be a relatively small component. The bulk of all of the real estate ownership EBITDA will be moving out. On the G&A side, we'll give you more – I'm not going to pick on others, I think you can look at our G&A at Hilton and compare it to our competitors and given my earlier comments about we are very top line but also cost and bottom-line focused and we think we do a really good job running a tight ship. We are going to be as efficient as anybody out there. Let's leave it at that and we'll give you more color on that both through the Form 10s and supplemental disclosures that will go along with that.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: And maybe just as a quick follow-up, in the wake of Starwood deal, do you think there's room for more consolidation to happen in the industry or do you think it's a dead topic for the foreseeable future?
Christopher J. Nassetta: You're talking about an OpCo world or…
Jeffrey J. Donnelly: In OpCo world because given the number of people who [are going to be] [ph] pursuing Starwood.
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think you will continue to see more of it. There aren't tons of logical combinations when you really dig into it, but my view is you're at that stage of the cycle, I think people have figured out that scale matters, there are some that have it and some that don't and I do think – I'm not going to in any way suggest anybody is scrambling around because I don't see that, but I do think people are taking deep breaths and saying, are there things that we could do to try and get some of that scale because I think there is something to this network effect that we've been articulating prior to and since the IPO, and I think proving out in both average market share of our brands and leading organic net unit growth, and I think when people look at that, look at what others have done with Marwood, et cetera, I think it has to make them think. Now what they do, I don't know. Again, I just don't sense people scrambling around in a mad dash but it'd be surprising to me if you didn't continue to see some incremental M&A activity.
Operator: Our next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley: I actually have two questions, I'm going to try and package it as one [indiscernible]. I'm wondering on the Q1 in group, I think on your prior call you had actually said that Q1 the group was looking strong. So I wonder if there was maybe a lot of cancellation of group kind of during the quarter, if you have any color on that.
Christopher J. Nassetta: So, no. In fact what's interesting on group, I was going through the stats with the team over the last week or two, not only we are not seeing any increases in cancel or attrition activity, it's gone down year-over-year, so a very good trend. I was sort of surprised myself. I assumed it would be stable, not that it would necessarily go up, but it's actually been going down. So I think we're mixing and matching comp sets unfortunately and that's – when I think we commented in the first quarter, I think we were really highlighting some of the bigger group assets, and what we were talking about today in terms of weakness in group and the group position was the whole system because I think everybody seems to be and should be really focused on our system-wide RevPAR growth in the first quarter and what we think for the system-wide at 3% to 5% for the full year. So it's a little bit of a comp set thing. If you look at our big, we call them our sort of top 120, or you look at the big six assets, they did actually have a reasonably strong first quarter in group. If you take it through the whole system, group revenues were up sort of 1%,. They were up depending on the bigger hotels, they were up 3% to 4%, okay. So I think that's the differential.
Robin M. Farley: Okay, that's helpful clarification. Thank you. My other question then has to do with cancellation and rebooking, but now this is not a question about group, this is just kind of overall business and a lot of this I think would be transient, both leisure and corporate maybe, are you seeing a change in pattern, an increase in consumers cancelling and rebooking closer to the time of stay as rates come down a little bit? It's something we've heard from others and I'm just wondering if it's something that you're seeing too, if there is any way to sort of quantify how that's changing. I know you had experimented with ways to create friction on that but it sounds like it's been difficult to do [indiscernible] that the consumers are kind of resistant to non-refundable or cancellation fees. So I'm just wondering if you could sort of talk about how much that cancelling rebook behavior may have increased versus last year, that kind of thing?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I don't think we've seen a big increase year-over-year in that. I think if you look over the last two or three years, we've seen a significant increase both by customer, because of customer behavior, but also technologies and apps that have come out that have accelerated the behaviour. We did do it, and so yes, like others we have seen that trend. It's more prevalent in certain major markets around the country. It's not as prevalent throughout the system. We do think it's an important issue. We are working hard on it. We did do the test, as I mentioned I think on one of the last couple of calls. Not necessarily that that's what exactly we want to do, but we wanted to get a sense of how our customers responded to it. We're working on a bunch of different approaches to it. And the trick here is to do something that makes sense for customers or that's what we're in the business of doing, is serving customers, but is also thoughtful relative to how we manage the inventory for ourselves and all of our owners. We're one of the very few businesses I can think of that ties up basically all of its inventory with no downside risk, and particularly in today's world with new technologies and these kinds of behaviors, that has a cost to it. Now that cost ultimately is going to be borne at some point by the consumer. So while it may seem like it's good for them, it may ultimately not be so good. So I don't have the answer yet. We're doing – we have all of our – as I say, we've got all our scientists working on it and we're trying to figure out as probably a little bit later this year how do we come up with a way to price our products in a way that customers understand it, it works for them for the various things, the needs that they may have but it's a more sensible way to manage inventory, and we're making some progress on it. Nothing to announce, nothing to scare consumers about. We're not going to do dumb things relative to that don't make sense for consumers, but we – there are other businesses, there are ways to be able to look at pricing for those that need more or less flexibility and to create different sorts of pricing structure. So we'll give you more when we have it. We're very focused on it because I think it's in everybody's interest, customers and owners and the system.
Robin M. Farley: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.
David Loeb: I promise only one question [indiscernible]. Chris, the pace of signings has been torrid but while openings have been strong, they've been a bit slower than signings. Are you seeing any issues that are slowing openings like economic issues, financing challenges, construction costs, and when do you see the pace of openings accelerating meaningfully?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not anything dramatic. I mean there are parts of the world, China being the best example, where you have seen as they over the last year or two have sort of been evolving their economy and shifting to more of a services versus an infrastructure based economy, you have definitely seen a slowdown there relative and a lengthening of development period between signings and openings. But there's nowhere else in the world, maybe a little bit in Europe as it's had, as Europe has had its ups and downs, but broadly speaking, if I went and actually statistically looked at the timelines that we've had historically between signings and openings, they are following pretty normal patterns maybe outside of those, particularly China and about a little bit of Europe, outside of those examples. So I think so goes on the lag to the signings. You can sort of prognosticate that the openings will pick up as you get to the gestation period for development.
David Loeb: So when do you see that curve really bending up the opening curve? So when do you think we start seeing the substantial increase in openings?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Given that we have doubled our net unit growth percentage at the same time we've been growing the Company since 2007 or 2008 by 50%, I think you've been seeing it. We've gone from sort of a low point of unit growth of 3% in 2010 to 6% to 7%. So we doubled our growth rate. At the same time, the Company has gotten 50% bigger. So I'd say you are seeing it. Hopefully appreciating it.
David Loeb: We are. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Kantor Hendrix: First, I just wanted to congratulate you on Tom Baltimore. We have a tremendous amount of respect for Tom and all he has done at RLJ and we're assuming he's going to do the same for Hilton REIT, go congratulations there.
Christopher J. Nassetta: I am confident. As I said in my comments, I've known Tom for 30 years. Tom was not just on the list, Tom was the No. 1 top person on our list, and we couldn't be more pleased that he was willing to come provide the leadership of our new REIT. So it's an exciting day for all of us.
Felicia Kantor Hendrix: That's just great. I know you talked a lot around this but I want to understand the impact of Easter a bit more. You definitely discussed your outlook for an improvement in April, but how much of that April recovery what you're seeing has benefited from the Easter shift?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Some of it for sure. I mean there's no question. It'd be hard, Felicia, for me to give you an exact number at this point, maybe when we get through the month and we have, we can scrub all the data we can. There's no question the reverse impact is benefiting you, but there's also no question – and I'm not trying to pound the [indiscernible], there's no question we're also seeing broadly unrelated to that a modest pick-up in corporate transient business. It's there, I've been talking to a ton of corporate customers. The great thaw that I described, it's going on. And what I can't tell you is like what is the result in terms of broader growth, exactly what is the shape of the uptick, but I think all things being equal meaning things stay in a relatively stable mode, it's just hard creating Easter effect, it's hard to apply common sense and not believe that you're going to see corporate transient pick-up.
Felicia Kantor Hendrix: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And just finally, Kevin, you didn't appear to prepay any debt in the quarter. I think you did that for most of last year. So just wondering, are you preserving cash for another purpose later this year such as share repurchases or is there any other reason behind that?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, we have, Felicia, these two big transactions coming up that as Chris said earlier in response to Steve's question have some expense associated with them. So that's in – and also as I said in my prepared remarks, we fully expect to target the same credit rating and start a share repurchase program once we get the spins or ask our Board to start a share repurchase program once we get our spins complete, but we're really just saving our cash for the transactions.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, we're hunkered down to get these things done and there are a lot of moving pieces all of which are manageable but we want to sort of get it done and create three pure-play companies and we'll get back on it.
Felicia Kantor Hendrix: It completely makes sense. Thanks.
Operator: The next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas Allen: China RevPAR accelerated from 3% last quarter to 8% this quarter. Did that surprise you at all? And you didn't change your guidance for the year. So just trying to hear your latest thoughts.
Christopher J. Nassetta: It did honestly surprised us to the upside a little bit. In talking to our China teams, I talk to our teams constantly around the world, they were a little bit surprised and part of what's going on is just sort of part of the great thaw. The reason for the great thaw is I think there is a little bit more stability in the Chinese economy. Certainly the world is starting to settle down on China. I think if you're in China, which our guys are, and operating running businesses I think, it feels like things are to our teams more stable, the business is showing up. And so, yes, we feel pretty good about what will happen for the year ahead. I'm not going to say we're being conservative. It's not going to make a huge difference in the numbers. Therefore a little off given it's a relatively low percentage of our overall EBITDA. But things are reasonably good. Surprised a little bit to the upside, not so much so that we thought we should change our guidance at this point. Some of it driven by some particularly strong group bookings and some of the bigger hotels in China, but all good. It's nothing but good. And same thing on the development side. We shifted the strategy there appropriately a couple of years ago to more of the midscale side of things, and we're continuing when others are not to accelerate both signings and particularly accelerate openings. I think we'll probably open 20% more rooms this year than we did last and last year was I think the best year we've ever had in openings in China. So, China feels reasonably good.
Operator: The next question will come from Chad Beynon of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
Chad Beynon: Just wanted to get a better understanding of what you're seeing in the first quarter and kind of going forward from a cost standpoint at your owned and managed properties with respect to labor, taxes, insurance, some of the inflationary things and kind of your outlook over the next 18 months on some of these important cost line items?
Kevin J. Jacobs: On an overall basis for the segment, we've seen cost per occupied room for the first quarter was still below 2%. So we've had pretty good cost containment there. On the U.S. hotels, we'll detail all this in the Form 10s and the like and how it breaks up, a little bit higher but we've been doing a good job of containing costs even in a wage and benefit environment that's been pretty high growth across the nation.
Operator: The next question will be from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.
David Katz: So if you could – I think you've sort of given some pretty positive context around the development landscape. Can you talk about the financing environment for hotels which I think obviously is an important driver of new franchising deals, new management deals, what are you seeing in terms of LTVs and the size of deal opportunities, et cetera, and directionally where you think that's headed?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'll let Kevin maybe get into more specifics because he's more active day to day and working with our owners. But at a high level, I think it's been reasonably steady. I think most of our stuff if you use the U.S. because it's a big chunk of where the development is occurring, most of it is getting financed by local and regional banks where you have owner-operator, some big, some small, that are financing with generally a decent chunk of equity or recourse on the debt. It's the way they do the business, and the local and regional banks have continued to be pretty stable. The end of last year and very beginning of this year when all the world in my description froze up, you were starting to see little telltale signs certainly on Wall Street of less capital available. I would say in my opinion, it didn't really trickle through the main Street very much and now with the world being stabilized with a whole bunch of our owners that are building these things a few weeks ago and I asked them, you're seeing any difference in your ability. Then they said, no, maybe a teeny bit more expensive, a little bit more equity, but no real difference in sort of the mainstream kind of lending environment or nothing that they viewed as material, the best quality, developers are still able to get it and still able to finance our stuff. Kevin, I don't know [indiscernible].
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, I think that's a good way of describing the Wall Street versus Main Street. I mean you know the main street side of it is where the lion's share of our development is getting done, especially in the U.S. On the Wall Street side of it, I think for existing cash flowing assets, when you had the world freeze up the way Chris described it, CMBS in particular, spreads did gap out quite a bit, but those markets have re-stabilized and they are looking a lot stronger than they were. But again on the main Street side of it, I think specific to your question about development, that is almost all local, they are highly equitised, they are financed on a loan to cost basis and it's just a little bit different environment than some of the things you've been hearing out of Wall Street.
David Katz: Got it. If I could ask one more smaller question, and I recognize that it's a smaller piece of your business, but given the split, it's relevant, we did hear a timeshare competitor talk about default activity yesterday. And I wondered if you had any perspective on your timeshare business and whether there has been any change directionally or anything notable with respect to timeshare notes and your customers in your system?
Kevin J. Jacobs: David, we saw those comments of course like you did and we have not seen that – that particular activity has not existed in our business, and frankly our customers, who is a little bit different customer, has been quite strong. So our default rates are not picking up. Our average FICO on new loans is almost 750, so a quite high credit profile for our customers. And frankly I was just looking at our default rates. We're not up really at all in the quarter. So we're not seeing that issue.
David Katz: Understood. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta for his closing thoughts.
Christopher J. Nassetta: All right, just want to say thank you everybody for spending so much time with us this morning. We continue to make great progress. You should be looking out in the not-too-distant future for our Form 10 to get more information on the spins and we look forward to catching up with you on the next quarterly call or before. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2015 Q4  (2016-02-26 10:00:00) =====
Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Holdings' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Denise. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For a discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please see the Risk Factors section of our recently filed Form 10-K. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of the current operating environment and the company's outlook. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then review our fourth quarter and full year results and provide greater details on our expectations for the year ahead. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're happy to kick off what should be an exciting year for Hilton Worldwide with our tremendous development momentum, new distribution initiatives supported by our largest marketing campaign ever as well as the planned spins of our real estate and timeshare businesses announced this morning. We think we're well positioned to drive value for guests, hotel owners, and shareholders alike. While we're confident in our ability to deliver industry-leading value over the long-term, we do realize that shorter-term macro concerns are weighing on sentiment. Despite increased uncertainty, we remained optimistic that 2016 fundamentals will continue to support top line growth. As we noted on our last earnings call, corporate transient demand began weakening in October and those trends continued throughout the quarter and into this year. Corporate transient performance in the U.S. did diverge in the quarter with oil and gas markets seeing declines, while non-oil and gas markets continued to be up in the mid-single-digits. Going forward, we expect corporate transient volume to remain highly correlated with the GDP and non-residential fixed investment, both forecast to grow this year modestly lower than last. Furthermore, corporate negotiated rates as well as group position are both up in the mid-single-digits this year, providing a good setup for continued growth. When coupled with supply growth that continues to run well below long-term averages, we believe, we are poised for solid RevPAR growth in 2016. As a result, we expect system-wide full year 2016 comp RevPAR growth between 3% to 5% with rate expected to account for 90% of that growth. This same-store growth coupled with accelerating net unit growth should drive high-single-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2016. Fueled by the strength of our 12 clearly-defined market-leading brands, we opened approximately 50,000 gross and 43,000 net rooms in 2015, representing 6.6% net unit growth in our managed and franchised segment, and a nearly 20% increase versus 2014. This was accomplished with no meaningful capital expenditures or brand acquisitions on our part and it included more than 14,000 rooms converted from competitors' brands and independent hotels. We continue to grow our industry-leading pipeline, signing over 100,000 rooms in the year for a total global development pipeline of 275,000 rooms including all approved deals. More than half of our pipeline is already under construction and represents nearly one in five of all rooms under construction globally, more than any other hotel company. Our growth rate in coming years will also benefit from our new midscale brand, Tru by Hilton. The brand's innovative design will appeal to a broad range of customers with a price point 25% lower than Hampton. It's tightly engineered design, relatively small footprint, and low development costs should drive very attractive returns for hotel owners. At its launch last month at Alice, we had nearly 130 deals in process, none of which were in our reported pipeline. To-date, we have over 160 deals in process and more than one in every four commitments received in January was for a Tru franchise. We have very high expectations for the growth potential of this new brand and expect to eventually open thousands of Tru hotels with the first opening expected later this year or early next. Tru will also further strengthen our network effect by bringing new and younger customers into our system and offering more opportunities for existing customers to stay with us. We also want to offer customers even more compelling reasons to have a direct relationship with us. This month, we launched our largest global marketing campaign ever entitled, Stop Clicking Around, highlighting key customer benefits of our network and its scale namely the joining Hilton HHonors and booking directly with Hilton offers customers the best value and a better experience. This includes offering HHonors members their points, of course, as well as preferential pricing, free Wi-Fi, and the ability to check-in and choose their room online as well as straight-to-room capabilities that we're deploying to all of our hotels globally. By broadly marketing these benefits, we hope to drive growth of our preferred channels, including our industry-leading mobile app that will increase our value proposition to guests as well as to our hotel owners. This morning, we also announced our intention to enhance long-term value for shareholders by separating our real estate and timeshare business segments, resulting in three publicly-traded companies. We have been clear about exploring our options and strategically manage that process in a way that allowed us to preserve the optionality to efficiently execute spins. We're pleased to have obtained a private letter ruling for the IRS for both spins. By simplifying our business, each segment should benefit from a dedicated management team with the capital and resources available to take advantage of both organic and inorganic growth opportunities. We believe it will also allow investors to more effectively allocate capital towards businesses more in line with their objectives. We intend to elect REIT status for the newly formed real estate company, enabling it to operate in a structure that is competitive with its peers, to facilitate access to capital markets, and to be more tax efficient. Currently contemplated to include approximately 70 properties and 35,000 rooms, the real estate company will form one of the largest and most geographically-diversified publicly-traded lodging REITs. It will have a high quality portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels located across high barrier-to-entry urban and convention markets, top resort destinations, select international markets, and strategic airport locations. The portfolio will be operated under our market-leading brands with industry-leading RevPAR index premiums. We expect the newly formed timeshare company to manage nearly 50 club resorts in the United States and Europe. The company will benefit from an exclusive license agreement with Hilton Worldwide, which will provide the right to market, sell, and operate resorts under the Hilton Grand Vacations brand, while also providing access to our strong commercial services platform and loyalty program. In addition, the timeshare company will continue growing its market-leading capital efficient business model. Our intention is to complete these spins by the end of the year with appropriate leadership, strategies, and capital structures in place to set all three companies up for success. We expect to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC, which will obviously contain a great deal of detailed information on these spins, we intend to do that during the second quarter of 2016. In closing, we are optimistic on the fundamentals and we believe that our clear strategy, scaled commercial engines, and a well-defined brand portfolio that can serve our customers for any need anywhere in the world, should continue delivering long-term value. I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarter and the year. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Our results for the year were quite strong with system-wide comparable RevPAR growing 5.4% on a currency neutral basis. Rate gains accounted for two-thirds of full year RevPAR growth. Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the high-end of our guidance at $2.879 billion, a year-over-year increase of 13% with margins increasing 290 basis points. Turning to our fourth quarter results, overall performance came in largely as expected, although, lower growth in corporate transient demand, particularly in focused service hotels, drove modestly lower than anticipated top line growth. System-wide comparable RevPAR grew 3.7% on a currency neutral basis. We saw a particular weakness in oil and gas markets, which we estimate adversely impacted system-wide RevPAR growth by 50 basis points in the quarter. Solid results in leisure helped quarterly performance as RevPAR increased more than 5%, driven by both occupancy and rate gains. Strong growth in BAR and leisure group business, where revenue was up 7% and 6%, respectively, in our Americas full service portfolio also boosted results. In spite of lower top line growth, adjusted EBITDA in the quarter increased to $745 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance range. The beat was primarily driven by better than expected corporate and other segment results, franchise sales, and some one-time items. For the quarter, system-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased to solid 230 basis points versus the prior period to 41.4%. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items increased 29% in the quarter to $0.22 at the midpoint of our guidance range with an incremental $0.02 of negative headwind from FX. Now turning to our segments. Management and franchise fees totaled $428 million in the quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year increase, which meaningfully exceeded our guidance range. This strong performance was driven by better than expected franchise sales including change of ownership and application fees as well as license fees. For the full year, management and franchise fees increased over 15% to approximately $1.7 billion as solid RevPAR growth at comp hotels coupled with new units continued to drive growth. In the ownership segment, RevPAR grew 3.6% in the quarter as growth was tempered by softer demand in Chicago, New Orleans, and Key West. Pressure was somewhat mitigated by strong RevPAR growth in Orlando, which was up nearly 9% in the quarter, while trends in Hawaii were also strong as a solid group base drove higher transient ADR. Given a favorable group mix, EBITDA at our Hawaiian properties also benefited from strong food and beverage business. Adjusted EBITDA for the ownership segment was $275 million, up 5% versus fourth quarter 2014 when adjusted for the sale of the Hilton Sydney. Margins expanded over 150 basis points on the same basis, helped by the 1031 acquisitions and greater flow-through from rate-driven RevPAR growth. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA for the ownership segment totaled nearly $1.1 billion, representing an 8% increase versus 2014 when adjusted for the Hilton Sydney disposition. Ownership margins expanded roughly 170 basis points. Timeshare segment revenues increased to $334 million in the quarter, driven by improved tour flow, which was up nearly 10%, somewhat offset by VPG declines of 2% as we lapped The Grand Islander launch last year. For the full year, tour flow increased a strong 10% and VPG rose 8%, helping drive full year adjusted EBITDA to $352 million, which was above the high-end of guidance. We also continued to make progress on our ongoing shift to a capital efficient business with third-party intervals increasing to 66% of intervals sold for full year 2015 and accounting for 85% of inventory or 114,000 units. During the quarter, HGV signed another capital efficiency for service deal, the former Westin Orlando Universal Boulevard, which was rebranded as Las Palmeras and will soon be converted to a 226-unit HGV club resort. The property will be HGV's fourth in Orlando. Now turning to regional performance for the quarter and our guidance for 2016. In the U.S., comparable RevPAR grew 3.8% in the quarter, pressured by demand softness in corporate transient business. Houston and New Orleans struggled with weaker demand due to energy market declines, while increasing supply in New York continued to weigh on pricing power. For full year 2016, we forecast U.S. RevPAR growth in the low- to mid-single-digits, while we expect concerns in energy-driven markets to continue, the effect should wane as the year progresses and we lap easier comps. The strong U.S. dollar will likely continue to affect inbound demand but to a lesser extent in 2016 than it did last year. In the Americas, outside the U.S., RevPAR rose 4.7% in the quarter as strong performance in Central America offset declines in Brazil, owing to a deepening economic recession and weakening currency in that market. For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR growth in the region to be mid-single-digits boosted by the Olympics in Brazil this summer. RevPAR in Europe increased 5% in the quarter, supported by strong market share gains, strong group business contributed meaningfully to performance across the region with group revenue up more than 8% in the quarter. Additionally, Germany benefited from strong leisure growth which mitigated softer transient business in London and political instability across certain markets. For full year 2016, we expect low- to mid-single-digit RevPAR growth for the European region. The Middle East and Africa region struggled, given the shift in timing of the Hajj, which benefited the third quarter but led to a year-over-year RevPAR decline of nearly 9% in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we saw declines in Egypt driven by cancellations and travel slowdowns following the Russian airliner crash, while the UAE experienced a shortfall in leisure volume. With uncertainty in the region expected to continue weighing on results, our full year 2016 RevPAR assumes a low-single-digit growth. In Asia-Pacific region, RevPAR increased 6.7% in the quarter, as robust group volume in Japan supported a 15% RevPAR increase in the country, an influx of Chinese tour groups drove 18% growth in Thailand, and we gained market share driving our RevPAR index up over 2 points in the region. RevPAR growth in Greater China decelerated to 3% in the quarter, ending the year up 7%. For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region to increase in the mid-single-digits with RevPAR in China up 5% to 6% due largely to market mix, continued share gains, and new hotel ramps, tempered by a softer economic setup in that country. Moving on to capital allocation. During the fourth quarter, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share, bringing our total dividend payout to $138 million for 2015. Our board has authorized a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of 2016. We also reduced long-term debt by more than $230 million during the quarter. Our total debt reduction for the year was approximately $1 billion, resulting in a net debt-to-trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.3 times, down from 4.1 times at the end of 2014. We remain committed to achieving a low investment grade credit profile and still expect to initiate a stock buyback program later this year. For full year 2016, we expect RevPAR growth of 3% to 5% and net unit growth in managed and franchised rooms of 6.5% to 7.5% to result in adjusted EBITDA in the range of $3.02 billion to $3.1 billion. That includes $25 million of expected FX headwinds. We estimate adjusted EPS of $0.92 to $0.98. And cash available for debt reduction and capital return of $800 million to $1 billion for the year. Please note that our full year guidance does not incorporate the impact of our intended real estate and timeshare spins. For the first quarter of 2016, we expect 2% to 4% system-wide RevPAR growth. This is lower than our full year forecast, given late January weather impacts of about 50 basis points, market softness in select gateway cities such as New York and Chicago, all exacerbated by relatively tough first quarter comps. We expect adjusted EBITDA between $630 million and $650 million. And diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.15 to $0.17. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year results as well as 2016 guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. I'm sure you have a lot of questions about our real estate and timeshare spins. We unfortunately cannot provide many additional details at this time. But, as Chris mentioned, we expect to file Form 10 registration statements with the SEC during the second quarter. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question. Denise, can we have our first question, please.
Operator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question will be Harry Curtis of Nomura. Please go ahead.
Harry C. Curtis: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning, Harry.
Harry C. Curtis: First, I just wanted to compliment you on receiving your PLR, I'm not sure investors really appreciate how tough it was to get it.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thank you.
Harry C. Curtis: Just kind of a two-part, one question, if I can get away with that. First of all, you've been contemplating the spin for a while and I'm curious if there are – if the spin allows the separate companies to undertake growth strategies that they've not done before that would add value. And then turning to Blackstone, there are some concerns that they would have to take their ownership stake down to accomplish the spin. Can you give us some insight into whether or not that has to happen?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah, happy to, on both fronts. As Kevin said, we're going to provide a heck of a lot more detail when we file our Form 10s to give everybody a really good sense about these companies. But I'm happy to give some directional sort of guidance on that. I'd say, the way to look at all three of these companies is – and the reason for – in part, for the separation of these companies, is to, of course, have dedicated management teams and allow for dedicated investor bases. It's, obviously, to create capital markets and cost of capital efficiencies. We're doing this to create tax efficiencies. And, last but not least, we're doing it to be able to activate all three businesses fully. When we think about activating it, to your specific question, I think that means both organic and inorganic growth. And so, I think the way to look at each of these businesses is that they are going to be setup to be the leaders in each of their segments and to be able to do everything that they need to do to be successful and grow long-term value. If that includes inorganic opportunities, then they certainly will have the capability to pursue those. On the BX question, that I know has come up a lot of times, we do – BX does not need to sell down in order for us to complete the transactions in the timeframes that we've talked about.
Harry C. Curtis: And the follow-up question would be, there has been some discussion about tax efficiency. Would that be impacted at all by them not selling down?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No.
Harry C. Curtis: Okay. Very good. Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi, we get one question, right?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Well, Harry, I guess padded his a little bit (22:33).
Kevin J. Jacobs: (22:33) So I don't know where we're going with this.
Christopher J. Nassetta: All bets are off.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Let's start with one.
Felicia Hendrix: Look, I know you guys can't talk a lot about the transaction. I'm going to ask one. Just, could you just help us think about the capital structure? Would you expect to refinance the debt that's associated with owned real estate and are there any mandatory payments that are going to have to be made because of the transaction?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Here's the way I think about it on the capital structure. Again, we're going to give you great amount of detail when we file our Form-10. There are no material financings required to get all of this done as I think we've talked about on prior calls. When we went public – just prior to going public, when we put the debt in place and we had the real estate related debt or the CMBS debt, we set it up to be portable. So it is portable and we can move the debt over. We may, opportunistically, enter those markets because we can improve the situation and have an even stronger balance sheet, but we don't need to do it. So I think the way to think about it is, we may if the markets are attractive during the timeframe between now and when we execute on the spins, we may in fact enter those markets. But there's no major financings required in order to get it done.
Felicia Hendrix: And, no mandatory payments.
Kevin J. Jacobs: And, no mandatory payments.
Christopher J. Nassetta: And, no mandatory payments, excuse me. Yes.
Felicia Hendrix: And, do these planned spins off impact your ability to begin share repurchases this year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Not in a material way. I'd say giving you a little bit of color on that, in order to get the transactions done, we will, by definition, have one-time costs. There will be friction that we've talked about on a number of occasions on prior calls in terms of operating three companies instead of one. The net effect of those things is a small amount of incremental leverage if you just do the math. We maintain our desire to want to be in low-grade investment grade, and ultimately within the OpCo business. And, that is, we've said sort of low- to mid-3s, I think really in the lower-3s. The effect of having a small amount of incremental debt means that it takes a little bit longer to get there. But, let me – we had been talking sort of mid-year-ish, I think, directionally. I think it means that we'll be in the second half of the year. But, we still have every expectation that we will begin – even with the spins, we will be able to begin a buyback program at some point later in this year. Obviously, we have a lot of moving parts at the moment. When you're taking a 100-year-old – nearly 100-year-old company and breaking it into three pieces, there is all sorts of things structurally that are going on. So, we want to get a little bit further down the line. But, it would be our intention and I think our credit even with a very small amount of incremental leverage associated with doing the spins. Our credit will be where we would want it to be in the second half of this year.
Felicia Hendrix: So, it sounds like both no financial gating factors, but also no regulatory gating factors.
Christopher J. Nassetta: That is correct.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Joe Greff of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph R. Greff: Good morning, everybody.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph R. Greff: Chris, have you determined who's going to be running the REIT, who's going to be running the OpCo and presumably the timeshare guys will be running the timeshare business?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. That's a really good question. And the answer is, you're pretty much directionally right. We have – at HGV, we have an amazing leader in Mark Wang, who will become the CEO of that business. That business is reasonably self-contained. Mark has been running it. He's a 30-year veteran of the business, in my opinion, strong opinion, the best guy in that business and I think has been and will continue to be a great leader of that business. On the real estate REIT side, we are considering various options at various levels that involve both internal and external candidates. And, hopefully, somewhere around the time of the filings or just thereafter, we'll be able to give you a little bit more clarity. Let me be clear, our objective is really simple, we want the best in all three businesses, we want to have the best management teams in the business, and we want each of these businesses to be the clear leaders in their business. And so, that will be sort of the philosophy as we build our teams.
Joseph R. Greff: Great. And the REIT that will have the roughly 35,000 rooms, how much of EBITDA is associated with those 35,000 rooms?
Christopher J. Nassetta: We will give you that in our Form 10. I know you're going to get tired of hearing me say that. But we'll give all of that disclosure when we file.
Joseph R. Greff: Great. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Okay.
Operator: The next question will come from Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, everyone. Good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Hey, Carlo.
Carlo Santarelli: If I may, I'd like to ask a little bit about the management franchise guidance for 2016. You guys are, obviously, guiding your fees 7% to 9%, RevPAR growth 3% to 5%, with unit growth kind of in the 6.5%, 7.5% range, is the entire delta there just primarily FX or other – some other things that maybe we should be aware of?
Kevin J. Jacobs: There is a – Carlo, it's Kevin – there is a little bit of FX, but then also if you look at 2015 we had a couple of, I wouldn't even refer to them as one-time, I'd refer to them as more timing items that caused 2015 to come in a lot higher than we thought at 15% in that segment. So we're lapping those comps a little bit. So that's all it is.
Carlo Santarelli: Okay. So more of a smoothing over the two year then?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Correct.
Carlo Santarelli: Okay. And then if I could just follow up a little bit on what you guys are seeing, specifically, in the leisure segment with respect to more kind of current environment pricing ability and the ability to drive rate, would you guys be able to provide some color on that?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah, I mean, I think the way to think of that business as you're seeing pockets – there are areas that have been a little bit weaker and that's really been IBT, individual business traveler segment has been weak for the reasons that we articulated in the prepared comments and that I know everybody has been talking about. BAR has been quite strong. So that would be sort of the negotiated corporate business. BAR, best available rate, which is the non-negotiated, has actually continued to be quite strong. Leisure up in the low- to mid-single-digits. Leisure has been up in sort of the mid-single-digit. So maintaining strength. And group has been reasonably strong. And as we mentioned briefly in the prepared comments, the group pace has been good at the end of last year and into the beginning of this year and the group position for the year is up in the mid-single digits. So all feeling pretty good. What sort of weighing – I think what's weighing on the IBT business is a bunch of different factors, I think largely it's a little bit – it's, obviously, a bit of a slowdown in the broader economy, but it has a lot to do if you really delve into the numbers with the energy markets, which are not just Houston and Dallas and the Southwest. And those markets, you've seen a clear – as I described in my comments, a clear bifurcation where those markets are down. If you look at IBT or business broadly, transient business everywhere else, it's still up. But when you put it all together, which is the economy, what you're seeing is sort of lower-single-digit growth in IBT still positive, so not to be a Pollyanna, but still positive. And then, you're weighting up overall performance, because of group, BAR, and leisure.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Shaun Kelley: Great. Good morning and thank you guys. So, Chris, you probably know the REIT business as well as just about everyone out there as well. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on the, kind of, general view on kind of capital market receptivity to a new, let's call it, largely full service REIT and how you think this is going to fit into the broader landscape of the lodging REIT community?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah, I mean, that's really I should ask you guys that I do have some vague memories of the REIT world from my prior life, but I've tried to expunge all of those, just kidding of course, no. You guys could judge that better than I could. I think what we're doing is really I think setting up a company that's – that has terrific assets. We've been very thoughtful including when we did the Waldorf sale and took $2 billion and did a 1031 into a bunch of assets, and thinking – forward thinking about how do we build a portfolio that is in the best strongest markets with the best growth profile with really high-quality assets that – where we've spent money and maintained the assets, and that are associated with brands that are the market-leading brands. So when I think about it, our objective is to put this company out there to be a market-leading company both in terms of the assets that it has and the strategy that it has that I think ultimately is to not only drive same-store growth at the high-end of the market, but to be sort of in a fulsome way the best REIT in the business. From my experience being running a REIT really well involves three basic things. It involves managing a balance sheet, it involves being really good at asset management, and it involves being a great capital allocator. And great capital allocator means knowing when to buy, knowing when to sell, there's times to do both of those things, there's times not to be doing those things. What we're trying to do is both build a portfolio out of the blocks that has great diversification, brand representation, market representation, and growth profile, and a management team that is the best of the best at understanding those three components of the business, so that we both drive same-store growth rates. But we also, through capital allocation at the right times in the right ways, can create a significant amount of value. So that's the objective. I think, as a result of that, I would hope that ultimately the markets will decide that there will be a great level of receptivity to a company that will be a very large cap, ultimately, as a result, liquid stock that is going to go out in the market and be really intelligent sort of focusing on those three pillars of what it takes to be successful from my experience in that world.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you. Thank you for that. And just as a quick follow-up, but we've got a couple of questions from investors about how to think about incremental SG&A at the two businesses. So I don't know if you could give us a little bit of color or thoughts about how we might think about that?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I know you're – I said you're going to be tired of hear me say this. We'll give you a lot of color on that when we do our filings. I mean you can triangulate off of things that are out there. I mean, I think, in a very high level, I'd say the timeshare business is other than sort of public company related costs relatively self-contained already, real estate business not as much. So you can look at what others are spending out there and you can scale it. This is going to be the second – probably the – clearly, the second largest. I mean you can do some basic math and not to be evasive. We're still refining those numbers and, at the time, we do the filing, we'll obviously give you some more clarity. But I think you can do a pretty good job directionally by looking at what exists in the marketplace.
Shaun Kelley: Thank you very much.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. Thanks, Shaun.
Operator: The next question will come from Steven Kent of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Steven Eric Kent: Hi. Two questions. It goes a little bit to what Shaun was saying. You provide intersegment adjustments to get to your adjusted EBITDA by segment. So timeshare fee $45 million, owned fee of about $130 million that are added to managed and franchised EBITDA. Are these the intersegment fees that the independent companies would ultimately pay to each other, or would there be a step-up? And then, to truly talk about an operating issue, which is Tru, is there any fear that Tru would start to compete with demand for Hampton Inn, especially from developers. How are those two brands differentiated?
Christopher J. Nassetta: On the first – thanks, Steve – on the first one, that's – you're right to sort of – I know you guys are trying to model and trying to figure it out, and we're really not trying, even though it seems like we are, to be evasive. But, we will provide that kind of detail when we file the Form 10s. I think the way to think about, here's how I'd think about the fees and those two give you some directional guidance. On the timeshare side, there is sort of a market that is formed for essentially a master license arrangement between a brand and timeshare company. So, I think you should think a little bit that we have something in place to probably directionally consistent with the market, and we're going to follow the market. On the real estate REIT side, similar sort of approach which is obviously, we're going to have very long-tenure agreements. These are really important assets to the operating company, because these are bellwether assets. In terms of economic terms, I think these will be a market-based kind of economics. Some – whether there will be adjustments or not, we'll clarify. But, I think the way to think about is long-tenure but economics that are market-based. On Tru, the answer is no. I mean there is always a little bit of sort of cannibalization that goes on around the edges with all the brands. But, I'll tell you the biggest – the most positive reception that we've had on Tru has been from our Hampton owners. In fact, what we did is go out first really to our existing owners, we have not – with 163 deals that we've done, it's 100% existing owners, we have not opened it up to outsiders yet, and the very large majority of those people are Hampton owners. They love it, because they realize that it's a different product, different price point. So, frankly, most of the 163 deals that we have done are from Hampton owners that are – have been part of our process and are very, very supportive of it. So, I think this is intended to be something different. As I say – I can't say there's never overlap in any of these price points and brands, of course there is on occasion around the edges. But, you're talking about a 25% lower price point, different cost to build, really a different sort of product approach. So, we think this thing is going to do incredibly well, and that it's going to allow Hampton to continue to be incredibly successful at the same time.
Steven Eric Kent: Okay. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: The next question will come from David Loeb of Baird. Please go ahead.
David Loeb: I promise to only ask one, and not ask one about whether you're going to take more than one.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, David.
David Loeb: I want to ask actually – I want to ask about the cancellation fee trial. What did you learn and how will the results impact your revenue management strategies?
Christopher J. Nassetta: We learned a lot in that. And, we did it – let me – we did it in a really blunt force way intentionally to sort of see what customers' reactions were. And, I think what we learned is customers hated it, okay? But, not – that's not really surprising, we knew they would. And, but we did get some nuanced intel out of the experience. I think going from where we are, which is an industry that not just us but all players in the industry, are willing to tie up inventory essentially for a large part of the customer base at no cost, which sounds illogical, and is illogical, and going from there to what we were testing in one step, I think is very hard just because of consumers have been trained for so long around the model the way it exists. I think what it tells you, though, and what we've learned is that there are some serious – there is some real opportunities to change the way we go to market in overall pricing. So it's, as opposed to the test that was quite blunt force intentionally, so we could learn, I think what you will see us do and we're in the process of doing the work and doing other tests right now, is the different ways of pricing our products both for different customers, short, long lead, more and less flexibility. To some extent, not unlike what the airlines and other industries have done. So I think of this as what we want to do is make sure that on behalf of ourselves and our owners that, we're not tying up inventory unnecessarily without customers having to take any risk or have any cost, but we have to migrate a behavior from where it is to where we want it to be. And I think there's some really intelligent things that I think you'll see us start to do later this year to start to move customers down that journey of recognizing, yeah, if you want total flexibility, there is a price for that. And if you want a better price then you're going to have less flexibility. And there's a lots of ways we can sort of create boundaries around our pricing structures to be able to accomplish that and I think get to the same place with a little bit less of a brute force approach.
David Loeb: So, Chris, just to follow up on that, there is I think valid concern that in any pockets of weakness or in any broad-based weakness, the repricing engines are going to lead to a lot of cancel and rebook behavior. How will you battle that? Are the initiatives you're talking about enough to really (41:09)?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I think so. Yeah, I think so. You'll have to see and we'll have to see as we roll them out. But I think so, that with, I think a lot of people in the industry including us sort of changing our cancel policies to thwart some of the robo techno approaches to cancel and rebook that are going on. We've changed our policies. It used to be same day for everybody in the industry, now it's 24-hour. There are things that we can do and sort of extending that timeframe in addition to creating different types of pricing structures for more or less flexibility and I think the combination of those two things, David, if we're smart should accomplish the objective.
David Loeb: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Thomas G. Allen: Hey, good morning.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning.
Thomas G. Allen: Hey, how are you? One of your peers last week said that their RevPAR in January was up, I believe, a touch over 3% and they expected February to be slightly better than that. Can you give us any similar color? Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. Similar, I mean we gave you our guidance of 2% to 4% for the quarter. January was basically 3%, very high 2%s, 3%. February, similar – similar, and we're hoping – January and February have seen transient trends in the mid-2%s. We do hope and are expecting March to have a bit of an uptick in the transient trends. So that's how we get to the 2% to 4%. But if you look at January and February, we're sort of running plus or minus 3%.
Thomas G. Allen: Helpful. Thanks. And then just in terms of 2016 U.S. RevPAR trend, you have a pretty diversified chain scale mix. How are you thinking about each chain scale? I mean, last year, you saw the inflection where the lower tier chain scales start to outperform the higher tier, but it sounded like in your prepared remarks there was some weakness in the fourth quarter and (43:22)?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. And I've been saying this I think for about a year or more – and we started to see it last year. I don't think you're going to see a huge divergence by the way, I mean this is one of things, when RevPAR starts growing at a little bit lower level, things do converge, the spreads converge on one another. But I do think you'll see higher end outperforming lower end a bit. And the reason, I'm sure, is obvious to you guys, that really the group side, right, because the higher – lower end doesn't have much group business, which, given group position, is stronger, lower end is much more transient in orientation. So, I would expect and I would say is natural at this point in the cycle from my experience in prior cycles that you'll see upscale and above upper upscale really and above outperform everything below, just for the group factor if nothing else.
Thomas G. Allen: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from Bill Crow of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
Bill A. Crow: Good morning, guys.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Morning.
Bill A. Crow: Chris, just a housekeeping question to start with. The timing of the filing of the Form 10?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Q2, where a lot of work going into it. We've done a ton of work. I'd hate to give an exact date, I mean we're – sometime in the second quarter, hopefully in the earlier part of the quarter than the later, but we'll see. It's a lot of moving parts coming together.
Bill A. Crow: Okay. And then a two-parter, and I'll be done here, on capital. I think there is a perception among the REIT investors in particularly that maybe you're, I think, you called them bellwether assets, need a lot of CapEx. So could you comment on that? And then, as we've heard from other companies, there's certainly some challenges in the financing environment out there. Have you thought about whether you're going to increase your investment in unit growth through either increased key money, mezz loans, anything like that? That's it for me.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Okay. Yeah. I'm happy to cover both and Kevin may want to jump in, if I miss something. On the CapEx, on the big super tankers or broadly in the owned estate, we've invested a lot of money. And I think since 2007 and 2008, $2 billion into those assets. We've I think done a very good job of doing the core things. There was a lot of deferred maintenance in some of those assets just in terms of room renovations, basic meeting space, some of the public spaces. And we've done a ton of that work. So I would say, my view is from a – sort of what I think the market worries about at least what I hear and I think implied your question is, as there are a bunch of huge deferred maintenance; no, there is not. We've spent, I mean on average, probably 8% of revenues or more, 8% to 10% of revenues on those assets. Having said that, I do think there is lots of opportunities because we have been very focused on being capital-light. And so, as it relates to opportunities to invest in larger ROI or doing incremental investing that could drive returns, I mean not deferred maintenance but incremental to deferred maintenance that would drive even higher returns. Being perfectly honest, we have shied away from that, because even though that's a big part of the company, as a combined company that's just not – we're focused on the capital-light side of the business, we think investors want us focused on that. So we have not been deploying as much capital as we could have. So I do think there's plenty of upside opportunity for a separate company that is going to be in the capital intensive business, by its very nature, and have an investor base that understands that, that actually is looking to make investments and allocate capital to get really, really strong returns on significant ROI opportunities. So that's how I would describe the capital. Kevin, anything to add to that? And then on the financing, I'd say, we're not seeing or doing anything usual to stimulate our pipeline. We signed, as you heard me say, 100,000 rooms last year. We opened 50,000 rooms gross, 43,000 rooms net. I think, in key money and all investments, we spent under $25 million last year, something like that. So, there is a lot of competition out there, et cetera, et cetera, but we don't see, at the moment, anything really material happening. I mean, with Tru, we've done 163 deals, and we have not spent one penny in key money or provided one penny of guarantees or one penny of mezz debt, one penny of anything, okay. So, we are very focused on being capital-light and the good news is we can be, because I would say, I think we have the purest, highest quality brand portfolio in the business. We have 13 the best brands, each one of them either the market leader or a category killer. They're the most financeable brands out there. They're the most consistently high brands out there. And it is obviously resonating with the ownership community given that we have one in five of all hotels under construction in the world. We're fighting it four times or five times our weight in terms of our existing base of supply in the world. So, I think, we've got really – I think we've got really good momentum on the development side and we – when it's necessary and it's strategic, we certainly have been willing to do small things. But it's a very small minority of ultimately the deals that we're doing.
Bill A. Crow: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: The next question will come from Smedes Rose of Citi. Please go ahead.
Smedes Rose: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask you a question just a little bit on your guidance. You note that cash available for debt reduction and capital return at $800 million to $1 billion for the year. And I was just wondering, is there anything going on there maybe with cash taxes or some – or working capital, I just – it just seemed at least relative to our numbers like a little bit lighter than what we were looking for? And I was curious if you could add a little color around that.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yeah. Sure, Smedes, it's Kevin. I think not fully knowing what you're looking for and certainly Christian and Jill can take you through the modeling what you're doing. But I would say, relative to last year, we did $1.1 billion. And I think that you got to remember, we had a couple of capital transactions last year including one very large asset that we sold, that we used the entirety of those proceeds to pay down debt. So, if you look at it on a run rate basis, this year's free cash flow guidance range is higher than last year's. And that's how we think about.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then you had mentioned in the quarter that your franchise fees or management fees were a little bit higher due to some franchising relicensing, I think. I was just wondering if you could isolate that piece in the fourth quarter.
Kevin J. Jacobs: No, I mean, it's just a – I mean, there are a couple of larger deals that happened in the fourth quarter and then it was just kind of volume, right. I mean, we're at – we're a pretty active part of the market for that sort of thing. So, we had good volume and we think we'll still have good volume this year; it's just some of the timing got pushed it into the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wes Golladay or RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, everyone.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning.
Wes Golladay: Hey. When we look at Stop Clicking Around, I guess is that more U.S. focused marketing campaign? And what's the difference in rooms booked directly in the U.S. versus international?
Christopher J. Nassetta: That is a global campaign in fact, at least in my history and I think probably in the history of company since just before I got here we put the company back together. And this is the first time we've done a global campaign that is activated in all forms of media, it's activated with all of our team members around the world every hotel. There's not a hotel that you'll go in, in our system, in the world where you won't see Stop Clicking Around. There's not a team member that doesn't know about it. So, it is an all hands on deck Hilton Worldwide effort and will continue to be so. The ultimate objective is, as I stated, it's really – it's about having direct relationships with our customers why do we want that because we want them to have a – we want them to get the best value that they can get, get the best experience, and we obviously want to lower our distribution costs for both ourselves and our owners. We're a couple weeks into it. So it's – maybe we can give you some stats next quarter, it's early days, but so far off the charts, meaning, we've had the highest levels of HHonors enrollments in our history and we've had some pretty high enrollment periods. We were up 50% in enrollments last year, but we're setting new records. We've had the highest level of web activity that we've ever had on our websites, more downloads on our app than we've ever had, and historically high revenues coming booked through the app. So, it's working. I think people are getting the idea that the best value and the best experience is going to come through being an HHonors member and booking through our channels. So big and global and this will be a drumbeat you're going to continue to see. Obviously, a big burst at the beginning, but you're going to continue to see a drumbeat for a very long period of time.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thank you. I look forward to the updates.
Operator: Our next question will come from Vince Ciepiel of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.
Vince Ciepiel: Thanks. Most of mine have been answered, but just a quick one. I wanted to take a step back, and think about the fee business on a standalone basis. I know you have a relatively higher exposure to franchise fees versus some of your peers. So how should we think about kind of longer term fee growth trajectory of your fee business? And then also maybe the durability of your fee stream in various market conditions?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Again, I hate to retreat to, we'll give you more later but – we'll give you more later. No, we are going to, when we file our Form 10s, give individual analysis and strategic thinking about each of the businesses, and break it apart in a granular way, so that you can understand that. I think a couple of things that we've talked about, and so you'll get a lot of information. I think the way to think about our fee business is, it's got tremendous growth potential both same-store and obviously new unit growth, and new unit growth is easy. We're leading in organic new unit growth, and my job – our job is to continue to do that, and we expect that we will. So that's going to add to the profile of the growth. In terms of the existing fee base, I think it's in a really good place in terms of having tremendous upside potential at a much lower beta. And I say that because a large part of it, I think it's something like 70% of the existing fee business which you can see without further disclosure, is in the franchise space, which means we have tremendous growth potential in that, but it's a lower volatility fee stream. We also have opportunities to continue to move those fees up. We have – our sort of market level of fees on average is about 5.5 and growing on average and we are now only at 4.7. So, we have opportunities to continue to move those fees up on our management business. We do have incentive management fees and lots of upside potential there. We've been growing those obviously in the 15% to 20%, before FX and increasing. The way to think about our incentive management fees is, it's very different than some of our competitors, because, number one, it's a lesser part, so lower volatility, it's 10% of our overall fee base growing at a nice rate, and 80% of it is in the international arena and the very large bulk of those deals do not stand behind owner priorities which is quite different than I think some of our competitors, particularly in an environment where things might slowdown and you have cliffs that you go over where you go under an owner's priority and fees go from something to nothing. We don't really have that, almost all of our deals that we participate first dollar of profitability and there is no cliff. So I think, it's actually – again, we'll give more detail, I know I just threw out a bunch of stats and we'll be happy to work with folks at the appropriate time that model it. But I think the way to think about it is, between the structure of what we have same store, new unit growth, tremendous growth potential but a lower beta business at the same time than some of our competitors.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks. And then finally just, could you comment on the quarterly cadence of what you're seeing in your group bookings?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. I think – for the full year, I think, first quarter is strong, second quarter less so. I think it's first and third quarter strongest is my recollection, second quarter a little less, and fourth quarter is always – fourth quarter is a smaller quarter for the group side.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from Robin Farley of UBS. Please go ahead.
Robin M. Farley: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask – I know that a lot of the detail is going to be in the filling. But when you look at properties that are going into the REIT versus those that aren't, I guess we had thought about maybe 80% of your owned and leased being – 80% of that being owned, but you're only putting in 70 properties of the 124 properties that are wholly owned and leased. Can you maybe sort of just give us some philosophy behind what's not going to go into – go in the REIT? And then....
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. Yeah.
Robin M. Farley: ...also – go ahead.
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, that's a great question. And yes, I can give you some philosophical view and then we'll provide the granular detail. I think what we've tried to do, as I said, is set up every one of these companies for a success. So, what we've thought about is there are both structural issues, of course, with what goes where, but we've tried to set up the REIT in a way that will be appealing to the REIT investor base, which means that it is – wants to be largely U.S. domestic assets, which thankfully we have a lot of those. There is – there will be a small complement of international assets where it makes sense. But it will be a very small minority of the overall company. Where we've left assets in or going to leave assets in OpCo has to do with some international where having long-term control of those assets makes sense for OpCo because it's how it will control its tenure. And then leases, particularly the international leases, are largely if not entirely left in OpCo because that is, number one, doesn't really work or fit within a REIT; and number two, it is the means by which we control our tenure, given the structure of how those were set up in the international estate and we want to be able to control our tenure. So that's philosophically how we did it, set each company up for success, make it very attractive to REIT investors and allow OpCo to continue to control its destiny on certain assets, particularly leased assets that are controlled under those structures for the long term.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yeah. And, Robin, I'd just add that, in terms of economics, this is factual that we've talked about before about the existing company is. Our top 10 assets are 50% of the EBITDA of the segment. Our top 20 assets are two-thirds of the EBITDA of the segment. So, no commentary on what's going to be in or out, but I think you can get a sense for the economics versus the asset split from those stats.
Robin M. Farley: That's great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And if I could ask part two of my one question, as everyone is.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Sure.
Robin M. Farley: Chris, you commented on the three things that are most important when running a REIT and one of them you talked about was the timing of whether – knowing whether it's time to buy or sell assets. So I guess I'd love to hear your view on whether you think right now it's time to buy or sell?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I actually would say right now is the time to probably do nothing, not to be trite about it. I think right now is the time – I do not think, with the uncertainty in the world, that it's a great time to go out and buy. I also don't think it's a particularly great time to sell, because the markets have really – capital markets for those kinds of transactions, debt markets, have slowed down. So there are times in the REIT world where the best thing to do is really hunker down and really drive the value of what you have. And if you're going to buy anything, I'd be buy what you know best, buy your own shares in an environment where they're significantly undervalued. I think now is one of those times.
Robin M. Farley: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: The next question will come from Rich Hightower of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one question here. I want to hit on one of Chris' earlier comments in the prepared remarks about organic growth opportunities in the real estate portfolio and I think you answered part of the question in the CapEx discussion in terms of potentially pursuing ROI projects that haven't been done to-date. But also were there previously internal resource allocation questions or things like revenue management or group production that might be improved upon when the real estate portfolio is spun out separately?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I don't think specifically, but I would say this, we've certainly had, I think, a very full asset management approach to these assets and I think our operators have worked well with our asset managers to drive good results. I think reality is, if being – I told you my three pillars, asset management, managing the balance sheet, and capital allocation, have we dedicated as a big operating company where the thrust of our growth has really been in the management franchise segment, have we allocated capital or G&A, if you will, to having a super robust asset management team with every resource available? The truth of the matter is, no. That's not to say we, I think, have been irresponsible in any way, we haven't. We have allocated capital the way we thought we would get the greatest return. So said another way, I think there are opportunities as this company becomes independent and builds an even fuller asset management capability to drive better results. And we will be very pleased to be working with them as a partner, a long term partner to do that.
Rich Hightower: All right. Thanks, Chris. That's all from me.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Katz of Telsey Group. Please go ahead.
David Katz: Hi, good morning, all.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Good morning.
David Katz: I wanted to just ask about specifically the timeshare business, because you mentioned that as a free standing business, it can grow in a more natural way, and we've certainly observed what's happened when a competitor of yours spun-off theirs , and we've seen other entities start to grow? And I wonder how you think about that timeshare business as a competitive landscape? Is there a point at which those entities can compete with each other? And since the one question rule seems to have fallen by the wayside, I wanted to ask about the shared economy, and it's become an increasingly focused upon issue within branded hotel environments and how you envision something like that fitting into your business today and then in the three parts, all using the same brand, and I'm referring to the sort of Airbnb type model? Thank you.
Kevin J. Jacobs: All right. So, David, I'll take timeshare first and then probably hand it over to Chris for sharing economies. So, I think, the way we think about it is our timeshare business has been a really strongly performing business for a long period of time, its top line revenue has more than doubled since we've been here at the company since 2007. The way it's done that is it has transformed itself to a capital-light business. We've singed up 11 fee-for-service deals, and we've significantly built our inventory such that it's been effectively growing in good times and bad, it continued to grow through the Great Recession. So we don't think any of that changes, it's going to be set-up for success. I think what Chris referenced before is it may allocate capital in a slightly different way, and I think that what that's going to enable it to do is, at times when it makes sense to maybe lean in a little bit more on capital, whether that's buying back inventory or investing in new projects, it will have the ability to that, because it's going to have a shareholder base that thinks about capital allocation slightly differently. That said, I don't think it ever goes back to the way it was, when we got here where we were spending $0.5 billion a year building timeshare towers. We permanently transformed this business under Mark's leadership and with our capital allocation efforts to where it's set up for success and I don't think it's going to – we don't expect it to perform any differently out on its own than it has been with us other than maybe a little bit...
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah, I would say...
Kevin J. Jacobs: ...a little bit higher tolerance for capital allocation.
Christopher J. Nassetta: And as a result, David, I'd say, we think that HGV can grow its bottom line a bit faster on its own than with us. Simply because, even though, Kevin is right, we are not going back, we are going to continue to lean in to being capital light. There is some, I think relatively modest incremental capital allocation that would be made to the business that, that investor base would understand and appreciate, that will help grow the bottom line a little bit faster. And those were investments that we did not want to make. We wanted to, again, be capital light. We did not – we wanted to allocate a minimum amount of capital to that or any capital intensive business as a consequence of having those businesses tied to the management franchise business. By delinking them, I think it allows them to allocate a little bit more capital and grow a little faster. And then on Airbnb, I mean, I certainly have answered the question. Exactly – I was trying to figure out exactly the tack. We talked about this quite extensively on the last call. Can you maybe refine the question a little more on what exactly you're asking?
David Katz: Yeah. What are you doing today and what are you planning to – what strategies have you added since the last time you discussed or answered the question, in terms of evaluating that as a business and whether it belongs within your branded system or not?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. I don't think we talked that. I don't really have a different view than – David, than we talked about last time. I think Airbnb's a real business, I suspect going to be around a real long time. I do think it is satisfying, I mean, it's a business that frankly has been around for thousands of years, that is becoming very, very efficient. I do think it is meeting demand that customers want. I think it's a different product that they're delivering on than what we deliver on. And in the sense that it is generally longer stay, leisure, and value oriented. That is not generally what we do. I think we have lots of products, we take a physical product and wrap it in a lot of hospitality and in a lot of service which I think is very different. So I think there is ample opportunity, as I thought on the last call, for us to coexist. I think we believe that these are different businesses. There is overlap in our customer base. We don't see any material impact from it. I think testimonial to that is that the industry is at the highest levels of rates and occupancy that we've ever seen in history. So we certainly have not been suffering. There's no sort of scientific data that would say that we're suffering. I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to coexist for them to do what they do best and for us to do what we do best.
David Katz: Thanks for taking my questions.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: The next question will come from Patrick Scholes of SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Patrick Scholes: Hi. How are you? One thing I was confused about just some of the assumptions that go into your 1Q RevPAR guidance of 2% to 4%. I want to clarify something. An earlier question you answered, you had said that for January and February you were currently tracking plus 3% for RevPAR, is that correct?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. I guess my confusion or where I'm not following is, we know that March is going to be a really tough comp month, how – what do you assume to get to the high-end of your RevPAR guidance or even your midpoint here because it seems a stretch in my opinion?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yeah. I mean, we – I don't really know quite how to answer that in a sense that we've said it's 2% to 4%, so we think we're going to be in the range of 2% to 4%. We've been running 3%, maybe a slight bit less than that. We do think transient trends are going to be a little bit stronger in March based on the booking trends that we see right now and I would say we feel good about being within that range. Exactly where we'll be, we'll obviously come back and report after the fact.
Patrick Scholes: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. And with no further questions, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Chris Nassetta, President and Chief Executive Officer, for any additional or closing remarks.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Well, we've probably taken enough of your time today. So, I'll just say thank you for spending the time with us. As I started out by saying I think we're going to have an exciting year in 2016. We still feel good about where our fundamentals are. We're very excited about the momentum we have in the development side of the business that add to our growth. The spins are going to – are complicated, but I think long-term we're going to create a tremendous amount of value. We'll look forward to telling you what's going on in the operating environment when we get together next and we'll look forward to giving you lots more detail on our Form 10, which I know based on all the questions everybody is interested in getting here in the not too distant future. So again, thanks for the time today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We’re pleased to report another strong quarter with top-line growth above the mid-point of our guidance and adjusted EBITDA above the high-end of our guidance. Healthy fundamentals should continue to drive solid performance for the rest of the year and in the next, which we’ll cover in a little bit more detail shortly. In the quarter, system-wide comp RevPAR [Audio Gap] currency neutral basis. Transient growth was the primary driver of RevPAR growth in the quarter as the expected holiday shifts impacted group demand. System-wide transient growth was up 6% in the quarter, strengthening significantly in September and with particular strength in leisure, which was up almost 10% in the quarter. System-wide group revenue increased nearly 4% in the quarter with strength in New York, Orlando and Los Angeles. Group revenue was strong in July with over 8% growth, but was tempered by the effect of calendar shifts in August and September. Americas owned and operated expected group revenue is up over 500 basis points in Q4 versus Q3 actuals and strengthening in pace. On top of strong top-line performance in the quarter and great cost discipline, both corporately and in the hotels that drove strong margin growth, we continue to benefit from significant and accelerating net unit growth. Our leading brands that can serve nearly every lodging needs guests have anywhere in the world they want to be, drive loyalty to our system and result in our industry leading market share premiums. Better top-line results drive better returns for our hotel owners and they in turn choose our brand. In the quarter, our net unit growth was nearly 13,000 rooms on openings of 91 hotels and more than 14,000 gross rooms. Our net unit growth of nearly 30,000 rooms through September is more than 12% ahead of last year and we’re on track to meet our 2015 guidance of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms. We’re also on track to improve a record total of nearly 100,000 rooms this year, continuing to grow the largest hotel system in the world with the largest pipeline in the industry as measured by star. We continue to get a disproportionate share of new development with our portfolio brands accounting for one out of every five rooms under construction in the world. That’s four times our existing share of global rooms and we remain number one in rooms under construction globally. Our goal is to win everywhere. And having a diverse portfolio of brands enables growth as markets have inflow. And China for example, we expect to sign more deals this year than last, because we strategically deployed focused-service brands there over the past couple of years and these brands are now ramping up as full service and luxury development slowed. Our China pipeline now contains 31 Hilton Garden Inns and 13 Hamptons. The first of hundreds of focused-service hotels, we expect to open in China by the end of the decade. We expect the pace of openings in China to increase as more focused-service hotels enter the pipeline with a typical time to build less than half of full-service and luxury projects. While full service and luxury development is slowed, we still see great long-term growth potential in these segments. In fact, we expect to open nearly 20 of these hotels this year with an additional 125 projects in the pipeline. It’s worth noting that nearly 30% of our gross openings year-to-date were through conversions, largely to our DoubleTree and Curio brands that grow our system but do not add to overall lodging supply. These conversions average less than one year, in our pipeline before opening and the average has been decreasing as a Curio can convert to our system in a matter of months. Our net unit growth is driven by what we believe is the best brand portfolio in the business. Every one of our brands has a growing pipeline and over half the pipeline of rooms are under construction. We have also organically launched three brands in the past few years to address incremental market segments and further our network effect. Home2, Canopy and Curio now account for over 420 hotels and nearly 55,000 rooms either open or in development. Earlier this month at the Lodging Conference held at the Arizona Biltmore, we begin introducing our new mid-scale brand to owners. The response was extraordinary. We expect to formally launch the brand early next year with a large number of signed deals and believe this could be our largest brand by number of hotels over time as it serves the largest segment of customer demand. All of our new brands are driving incremental fee growth at essentially a 100% margin. And this has been achieved with no acquisitions and essentially no capital investment on our part. We believe that the scale of our high return organic brand growth leads the industry. Now, let me take a minute to update you on our view of the cycle and our outlook for the rest of this year and in the next. In the U.S. which drives nearly 80% of our earnings, we expect continuing strong fundamentals driven by moderate demand growth coupled with historically low supply growth. With that said up, until that supply demand balance meaningfully changes, we should continue to deliver a mid single-digit RevPAR growth, consistent with the cycle today. Supply growth is forecasted to be half of the 30-year average this year and only modestly growing next. There is good visibility into new capacity with years of lead time. And annual estimates on supply growth during this cycle have tended to be higher than what was actually delivered. Overall development continues to be largely driven by economically rational projects in markets that can support the room growth. We get a number of questions about Airbnb’s potential impact on supply, so I thought I’d give you a sense of how we view it. As you would expect, we’ve done a lot of thinking and work on the topic including having commissioned some independent analyses. The bottom-line is we believe that a large portion of Airbnb’s demand is incremental. The bulk of the demand is in higher rated, high occupancy urban markets; it is longer length of stay with a predominantly leisure and value focus and stay occasions where customers are willing to accept inconsistent product with very limited services. We do not believe there is a material impact on the bulk of our markets or with our core business and leisure customers. As we speak to our largest corporate clients, we are confident that Airbnb will not satisfy a meaningful piece of their demand. We’ll obviously maintain a watchful eye on Airbnb as time goes on. Now back to the fundamentals. On the demand side, there is a very high correlation between lodging demand and macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth and non-residential fixed investment, both of which are forecasted to modestly increase next year. So, a steady and intact business cycle bodes well for us. Specifically for the fourth quarter, we expect 4% to 6% system-wide RevPAR growth. In the U.S. for the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR growth to be consistent to modestly better than the past couple of quarters, driven by consistent transient demand and improving group trends. Outside the U.S., we expect fourth quarter RevPAR growth to be meaningfully lower than last couple of quarters, in large part driven by the EMEA region after a third quarter that benefited from a tremendous summer season in Europe and a favorable holiday calendar in the Middle East. Overall, system-wide trends for the fourth quarter are a bit lower than we had anticipated due to the difficult comps in EMEA that I just discussed and U.S. transient growth in October that has not accelerated as we anticipated against a difficult year-over-year comp. For the full year 2015, given results to-date and our fourth quarter outlook, we expect system-wide RevPAR growth between 5% to 6.5%. We’re raising our full year 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million at the midpoint to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion. Looking ahead to 2016, our guidance reflects our view of continued strong fundamentals and it’s supported by a group position that continues to track up in the mid single digits with a strengthening pace of transient growth consistent with current trends. As a result, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase 4% to 6% in 2016 with 75% to 85% of that’s being driven by rate. We believe that RevPAR growth will be led by the Asia Pacific region and the U.S., both of which should be above the mid-point. We expect RevPAR growth in Europe near the mid-point and Middle East, Africa region below the mid-point. We also think that our strong development pipeline will support unit growth acceleration in 2016, translating into global net rooms growth of 45,000 to 50,000 rooms. Lastly, we continue to work diligently on potential strategic alternatives for our timeshare and real estate businesses. We’ve made great progress assessing these complex opportunities and our hoping to be in a position to update you all when we report our year-end results. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarterly results and our outlook. Kevin?
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our RevPAR growth of 5.8% was driven by a 4.2% increase in average rate and a 1.2 percentage point increase in occupancy to nearly 80%. In actual dollar, system-wide RevPAR per increased 3.3%. RevPAR growth year-to-date through September is 5.9%, roughly two-thirds driven by rate. Diluted earnings per share adjusting for special items was $0.23, an increase of 28% versus the prior year period and at the high end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA was $758 million for the quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year, beating the high end of our guidance by approximately $8 million. Fee growth and timeshare outperformed expectations with the majority of the timeshare being timing driven which should normalize in Q4. For the quarter, enterprise-wide adjusted EBITDA margins were up 290 basis points year-over-year to 41.4%, driven by lower than expected corporate and other and fee revenue. Management and franchise fees were $438 million in the quarter, up 14% over the third quarter of 2014, driven by strong franchise fees, new unit growth and franchise sales. As noted last quarter, we expect fee growth in the fourth quarter to moderate owing to accelerated timing of fees booked earlier in the year than we initially anticipated and some one-time items that benefited prior year results. However, solid comparable fee growth, outsized organic net unit growth and rising royalty rates continue to provide a healthy setup for future fee growth. And as a result, we are increasing our 2015 management franchise fee growth guidance to between 12% and 14%, an increase of 1 percentage point at the midpoint. In the ownership segment, RevPAR grew 6% in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA was $281 million, up approximately 10% versus the prior year adjusted for the sale of Hilton Sydney. Results were boosted by better performance in our international portfolio, particularly our UK hotels and lower utility prices which supported segment margin expansion of nearly 190 basis points, again adjusting for the Hilton Sydney sales. Adjusted EBITDA was adversely affected by soft group demand related to holiday shifts. Hawaii was further affected by weaker transient business from Japan although strong group position benefited one of our larger properties. Chicago had lower occupancy due to fewer citywides. And renovations at the Moscone Center were somewhat of headwind in San Francisco. Timeshare segment revenues increased 13% in the quarter as a result of continued growth in our capital light timeshare sales and favorable resort operations. Overall timeshare sales volume was up 19% in the quarter, driven by tour flow increases of nearly 12% and VPG increases of over 6%. Adjusted EBITDA was $99 million in the quarter, growing 24% versus the prior year period. This exceeded our expectations by about $8 million which as I mentioned earlier was largely driven by timing. We continue to expect strong tour flow and VPG growth and maintain our timeshare adjusted EBITDA forecast of $335 million to $350 million for full year 2015. Finally, our corporate expense and other was $60 million for the quarter, slightly better than expectations. And as a result, we now expect growth in that segment to be flat to moderately down year-over-year. Moving on to our regional results. In the U.S. RevPAR grew 5.1% year-over-year at comparable system-wide hotels, up slightly from 5.0% in Q2. Performance is driven by strong results in July with transient and group revenue, both up in the high single digits. As we anticipated, growth in August and September was tempered by softer group business, largely attributable to holiday shifts and difficult year-over-year comps. International inbound revenue declined 1.7% during the quarter, owing primarily to weaker demand from Canada, Japan and Brazil but mitigated by increases from China, Spain and the U.K. Year-to-date revenue from international inbound travel to the U.S. is up 40 basis points versus prior year while overall room nights are down 2.9%. In the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 7.5%, driven largely by strength in Mexico and somewhat hindered by softness in Brazil where performance struggled due to economic weakness and was exacerbated by tough year-over-year comps as we lapped the 2014 World Cup. We expect Brazil to remain soft but then positive momentum across other countries should continue supporting mid-single digit RevPAR growth for the full year. RevPAR growth in Europe increased 8.8% in the quarter driven by three consecutive months of robust growth in the region and continued market share gains, with our RevPAR index in Europe up 1.2 points for the quarter. Improving fundamentals were supported by a record breaking summer in Continental Europe which benefited from tremendous leisure transient business. U.S. travel to Continental Europe increased 14% year-to-date. Results were modestly tempered by softer group volumes, given difficult 2014 comps from events such as the Commonwealth Games and The Ryder Cup. While challenges in eastern Europe particularly Russia continue to pressure regional performance, we remain confident in our ability to deliver solid results given increased inbound travel and local demand, coupled with rising market share. We maintain our mid-single digit RevPAR growth forecast for 2015. In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR grew a strong 9.1% due to continued recovery in Egypt which posted its strongest quarter since 2010. Additionally, Saudi Arabia benefited from stronger group performance owing to favorable calendar shifts in Ramadan and the Hajj which will in turn weigh on fourth quarter results. We anticipate low single digit RevPAR growth forecast for the year. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR increased a robust 10.2% versus prior year, driven largely by a 23.9% gain in Japan as the country continued to benefit from increased local demand and influx for Mainland China and strong transient rates. Additionally, easy comparisons aided performance in Thailand. Strong corporate transient leisure volumes coupled with market share gains supported 7.6% RevPAR growth in Mainland China. We expect transient China to remain favorable in spite of broader economy deceleration. We think increased outbound demand from the UK and U.S. combined with our market mix and market share gains, position us to continue delivering solid growth. Our RevPAR growth forecast for China remains 6% to 8% and we maintain our high single digit growth expectations for the Asia Pacific region. Turning to capital allocation, we reduced long term debt by $350 million during the quarter with a subsequent payment of a $100 million in October, bringing total debt reduction year to date to $850 million. We ended the quarter with a net debt to trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.4 times. We paid our first quarterly dividend in September and expect to maintain a target payout ratio of 30% to 40% of recurring cash flow. We are on track to achieve a low grade investment credit profile by the second or third quarter of next year, at which point we would likely commence programmatic share buybacks. In terms of our outlook for the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are narrowing system-wide RevPAR growth guidance to between 5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $10 million at the mid-point to $2.84 billion to $2.87 billion. Our full year guidance continues to assume approximately $60 million related to FX impacts for the year. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4% and 6% on a comp currency neutral basis, adjusted EBITDA of between $706 million and $736 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our third quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We’d now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, can we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator instruction] And your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Chris, thank you for the detailed kind of overview in the prepared remarks. One thing that I think is on people’s mind is sort of what you are seeing so far into the 4Q. And you talked a little bit about, little bit softer transient growth in October than maybe you had expected. So, I was curious, I think coming into the quarter most investors expected that 4Q is going to better than 3Q. If you could just elaborate a little on sort of what you are seeing in the business right now, I think that would be helpful.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I assume somebody or many people would ask that question because it’s on everybody’s mind. And we’ve obviously spent a lot time looking at what’s going on in the results. Focusing on the U.S. for the moment which my guess is what you are more focused on in your question. I think what we are seeing is generally consistent with what we would have expected with exception. The group side in the fourth quarter is getting better as we expected. The transient side of business is generally tracking consistent with what we saw over the last quarters, as I said in the prepaid comments. And when you put those two together, that’s how you get a U.S. fourth quarter that we said will be sort of similar to modestly better than what we’ve seen in the last couple of quarters. I will say we had anticipated, forecasted, maybe hoped for a transient pace that would pick up in the fourth quarter and particularly in October which is a very big transient month. And that has not materialized the way we had thought. Now I’m not one who likes to sort of give you their 50 excuses or reasons why. When we look at it and we’re sort of still trying to understand everything in a great amount of detail, it seems like it’s a few things that’s going on in October, one you are in a month we have very high levels of occupancy, in the low 80s. So that is an issue. The comps over last year where you had high single digit transient growth last year. So, you put those two things together, it makes it hard to sort of expect a lot. And so in part maybe we were a bit aggressive in our views of pickup in transient business in October. What’s really happening as I said is it’s stable, it’s not -- it hasn’t really ticked down, it hasn’t kicked up; it’s been relatively stable. The other thing that’s going on and it’s hard to perfectly scientifically quantify it as we had two hurricanes. And I know everybody sort of gets tired of weather. But weather has an impact. And we had two hurricanes that ended up net-net on the East Coast and other parts of the country, cancelling thousands of flights, so people couldn’t get places. We do think that in October in transient that there was some impact in that regard. And I would say in the corporate business which is what we expected to pick up, it has been a little bit choppier than we expected, meaning the net result is about where we’ve been. There have been weeks that have been better and worse, so a little bit choppier. So, it’s a whole bunch of stuff. I guess the primary theme that I would sort of glean from all that I would suggest as what we’ve gleaned from it all is that what we’re really seeing in the fourth quarter is strengthening of group the way you expected, particularly in October in transient that is clicking along pretty much like the second quarter and third quarter. And those things are combining to drive a reasonably good result sort of where we’ve been or a little bit better in the U.S. The rest of the world which is why the fourth quarter number is four to six is really a comp exercise, particularly off of third quarter you had massive leisure season in Europe with Europe on sale. In the Middle East, you had the HOD [ph] shift from fourth quarter last year to third quarter. When you put those two things together, RevPAR growth in the rest of the world which is just fine for the year and it will be fine next year and everything is good, it’s just a comp issue, will be less than half of what it is was in Q3. So, you put together, a stable to modestly better U.S. story with the comp issues and the rest of the world and that’s sort of how you get there. But we’re -- thing are developing, as I said, pretty much to where we thought with the exception of not seeing the pickup in transient demand in October that we forecasted.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: I had two questions. One, Chris, if you won’t mind sharing kind of how your view around some of the strategic initiatives you’ve previously spoken about has changed? And secondly, if I could ask, as it pertains to your outlook, how much of the change and maybe the tone around 2016 and beyond stems from what you’re seeing in your business today versus maybe what you are seeing in hearing from commentary of complementary peer industries?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, happy to cover both. On the strategic initiatives, I covered it, albeit briefly, in my prepared comments and not to repeat it. We are making really good progress. It is -- they are massively complex sort of options that we’re thinking through and with lots of different moving parts. And I would say we don’t really think about it any differently than any prior commentary that I’ve made. But we’re not in a position to really get into it at any level of detail at this point until we finish the process. And that’s because honestly I think it’s just unfair to piecemeal it and can talk about one element of it without talking about all elements of it. So, we’re making progress. It’s maybe taking us honestly a little bit longer. But as you can imagine, there are lots of things going on that impact it. And we’re I think rapidly getting there and will be in a position to lay it all out for you guys, whatever it is that we think makes sense and it’s not too far out. And in terms of 2016 guidance, I’m glad you asked it because you may or may not like the answer. We obviously look at our performance on a forward looking basis in a very granular way; we go through a very detailed budget by property and aggregate that all together to determine where we think we are going to be in the world. And we are not quite complete but we are very-very close to complete. And I think, we’re not going to share that budget, obviously we never do. But I think it would be supportive of what I suggested in my commentary, which is we’re still in a very healthy part of the cycle where we have moderate demand growth matched with very limited capacity additions. And we’re going to drive I think very healthy RevPAR growth. So the underpinning of that is that we feel good about things. We think that the transient trends we see here and now that I just described, supported our group position in the next year in the mid single digits, supports it. And so that’s how we’ve sort of determined. You can imagine our budgets are likely more at the higher end than anywhere else but we’re always -- you don’t get what you don’t ask for at the property level and we’re always pushing. There is a level and I will be perfectly honest than not, in a sense not perfectly scientific, there is sort of a overlay of a bit of conservatism that we’ve put in our guidance that we just described, that Kevin and I just described to you. And that is just because we are out there, we’re talking to all of you, we’re talking to -- I’m talking to lot of contemporaries and lots of different industries, we read the papers, watch the news. And I think vis-à-vis the summary then the macroeconomic risk profile has gone up a little bit, right? I mean, we’re very optimistic, you know that; you heard my description of what we think we can deliver and we’re going to good healthy part of the cycle. But there are more I think a little bit higher level of macro risks than might have existed three, four or five, six months ago. And so we have definitely sort of put an overlay -- a bit of an overlay of conservatism into our guidance to take that into account.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley: Just looking at the guidance you gave by region, it sounded like each region was essentially unchanged in your guidance but the overall guidance came down. Should we just think about it being lower in the range and I don’t know of this transient comment, is that mostly the U.S. issue or is that something that you’re seeing in those other regions as well? And then maybe just as a quick follow-up and maybe this one is for Kevin. Your full year EPS guidance was unchanged at the midpoint but your EBITDA went up at the midpoint. I guess maybe some color about why we’re not seeing more flow-through from that because I don’t think your corporate expense is any higher, so some color…
Chris Nassetta: I’ll take the firstly, leave Kevin the second. In terms of our guidance, I mean I was trying to really give you a super high level trajectory on by the region. So I don’t think your math is necessarily wrong. And I think my last answer probably is the right answer, which is what we try to do is look at what we think we’ll have by property, by region and then we have -- there is an overlay of a bit of conservatism.
Robin Farley: Is it more that the U.S. -- if we think about your guidance, moving within the range unchanged but where within the range it’s moved; is that more…
Chris Nassetta: I would say Robin, to be honest; it’s sort of across the board probably. Our conservatism is there are a lot of things going on in the world; I think the risk profile in the world is a little bit higher than it was. So, assume it’s sort of a general risk overlay of conservatism, not specific to U.S., obviously U.S. is a big part of the business. So, by the very nature of that overlay be predominantly U.S. overlay.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great, thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: And then Robin, the full year EPS is just in -- the outlook there is in incremental penny of FX translation in there that just kept us from moving the range up.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open. 
Joe Greff: Chris, not to beat the dead horse here about the transient commentary in October but it sounded like it was a pretty broad statement for the U.S. But can you talk about what markets where maybe things were not as bad or can you just talk about whether it was -- how market specific or how chain scale segment specific the trends that you’re seeing so far in October?
Chris Nassetta: I will maybe give it to Kevin by market but I would say, it was -- we had expected broadly an increase in transient. Again, we may have been wrong in expecting that given the high occupancy months that we are in and the comps but we expected it broadly. And I would say the trends have been -- every market is a little different but the trends have generally been consistent.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think that’s right. They have been pretty consistent. Obviously, Joe, every market has its own story but the larger markets with larger hotels tend to have a bigger impact for us overall but I think they’ve been generally pretty consistent.
Joe Greff: And can you talk about your outlook for corporate negotiated rates as we’re in the midst of that negotiation, what your expectations are broadly?
Chris Nassetta: I think, I just was with our team that is in the middle of those negotiations in the last week, and I think we’re solidly in the mid single digits, maybe mid single digits plus.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis: First question is if in October you’re seeing record occupancy, what’s keeping your property managers from pushing rate more?
Chris Nassetta: I think we are trying to push rate. And think as you will probably end up seeing in October that most of the RevPAR growth is going to be raised. So, we are having some success market by market but I think you will see the lion share of the growth that come through rate. Because there is just not that much more occupancy to get particularly during the week. So, should be all rate. And I think we can always do better. I think we’ve been having reasonable success there.
Harry Curtis: And second is turning to Airbnb, I think that Airbnb is working hard at addressing some of their weaknesses related to appealing to the corporate travel. How likely in your view is it that they will be able to overcome some of the more obvious issues of -- for example duty of care and the lack of the amenities?
Chris Nassetta: I think it’s relatively impossible. I mean the way I think about Airbnb is it’s really as I describe sort of largely urban -- high rated urban markets where -- and where their business drives, where there is an enough capacity broadly in the market, and it is generally for more extended stay. And with the leisure -- even when it’s business that has sort of a leisure component, bring your family or part business, part leisure. And I view that as an evolving segment, if you will, that is satisfying maybe some of our customers; I am sure some of our customers but a lot of incremental customers that are not our customers, needs in a way that haven’t been satisfied before which is why you see a very large component of Airbnb business being incremental meaning they’re creating trip occasions that wouldn’t have existed otherwise. So, I think as they sort of carve that niche, I think it becomes more of a segment undo itself. I do not believe strongly, do not believe that they are major threat to the core value proposition we have, which is consistently high quality product and service delivery. And service delivery incorporates into it a significant amenity package. Just simply because I don’t think that given the segment they have curved out in the model but there is a real ability to do the things that we do. Again, it doesn’t mean I think Airbnb is not a really good business and business is going to be around for long time, I think it is a good business and will be around. I just think it is serving a different kind of need; it’s a different business segment onto itself. And the segments that we are serving largely I think will remain separate and distinct from that. And I think it’s very hard -- I think it’s very hard for us to do exactly what they are doing. I think it’s extremely hard for them to be able to do -- replicate what we are doing. And I don’t think customers, suddenly woke up our core customers and said we really don’t care about consistently high quality products and we don’t need service and we don’t need amenities. I just don’t buy it. And by the way scientifically and the research that we have done and we have done an immense amount of it, that’s not what customers are saying to us, quite to the contrary. They are saying they want more -- our core customers want more consistency, more quality, more service delivery, more of the amenities that they want and that they value.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff Donnelly: Two questions, actually just continuing first with Airbnb. Chris, down the road, how do you think their platform evolved? Do you think it may be strategically combines the major hotel brand and there is a reason for having a continuum of product from hotel rooms to Airbnb product, or do you see it maybe going the other way, towards more of a reservations engine like an Expedia?
Chris Nassetta: It’s hard to say. You should ask those guys. I might have a view if I were running it but I am not. I don’t think it becomes connected to hotel brands, I could be wrong. I don’t see that. But it’s possible. I mean if you believe what I just said a few minutes ago that it’s sort of developing into its own segment, one of the big hotel companies could say that’s a segment we want to serve and we don’t serve, and we don’t think it cannibalizes any of the rest of our business, which I’d happen to believe is true and we want to have that segment. But I wouldn’t probably view that as a high profitability. I think if you look at it, they are creating a very loyal customer base that wants to buy things through their system. So, I don’t know if I had to guess, it becomes through those loyal customers, a broader platform to do other things. But again, they don’t have a call I guess since they are private but they have lots of investors I guess. So, I would ask them. I do believe that strongly as I said that there is every ability for us to coexist. I know a lot of people are spending a lot of time; we are spending a lot time on this call and for good reason by the way. I told you in my prepared comments, we’ve thought about it a lot. We have done a lot of research independently and our self. So you guys should care about it. But I suspect over time investors, everybody will see it for what it is, which is a really good business but a business that is maybe not a 100% but largely distinct from what we do and that there is every opportunity for both of us to have really successful business models.
Jeff Donnelly: And then just as a follow-up, obviously there is lots of banter in the press about what’s going on with Starwood or with Hyatt or the Chinese buyer. How does the threat of a potential combination between whoever, Hyatt or Chinese buyer, maybe affect your thinking on the strategic landscape? And maybe second to that can we rule out Hilton’s interest there?
Chris Nassetta: Second first, you can rule out Hiltons’ interest. Okay? So, to be in abundance of clarity, we are not involved in the process in any way. Secondly, and the second and why I went in that order is because it leads to the second. And the reason that we’re not is we feel -- I am not going to comment on who might do what; it’s not my business and I don’t know other than the rumors and what I read like you. The reason we are not involved in that process and the reason I’m not worried about what happens there is, we feel a very good about the setup that we have. We feel like we’ve done an amazing job transforming this business over the last eight years to create a real formidable network effect with both our scale, our geographic diversity, our chain scale diversity, the strength of our individual brands, every one of which is either a category killer or leads the industry on average the highest mortgage share in the industry, having launched three new brands with an opportunity to launch more, one coming around the bend and be able to do that in a way where we’re leading the industry in organic growth and driving incredibly high returns incrementally, infinite return, IRRs and a 100% margin business. We don’t feel -- while we feel like there are always going to be gaps that we need to think about, they are relatively modest and those are opportunities, those are not weaknesses for us given the other attributes that we already have. So, when we look at the world, I think we got to run the company while we can’t get complacent which is what happened to our company up until eight years ago. We sort of gotten top of the hill and became complacent. We are not going to get complacent, not while I’m here. We’re going to stay on the balls of our feet. We have an amazing business and amazing opportunity in front of us and that’s what were focused on optimizing for all of our benefit.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Bill Crow: Chris, you did a great job in the introduction talking about the fundamentals; you painted kind of a broad brush. But if we take a little finer look and we kind of get beyond national supply and demand statistics, we start looking at the bigger gateway cities. It certainly seems like there is some underperformance there that might otherwise be matched. I don’t know whether it’s international demand, Air -- hate to mention Airbnb at this point or maybe increased supply where we are hearing 2%, 3%, 4% in many of these big markets. I guess the question is what are you seeing with your pipeline, with your owned assets which are in many of these markets; what do you have to say about those kind of gateway cities?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Honestly, you are right; every major cities got a different story. I would say broadly outside of New York, Bill, we don’t see a lot of it. People have been talking about Airbnb and other things in San Francisco. We’re going to be double-digit RevPAR growth this year and we think next year is going to be another really good year in San Francisco. New Orleans a great story. We’re having a great year in Chicago, maybe a little bit weaker there next year than this year. Outside of New York I would say, we just don’t see particularly significant issues. The way I would look at it is we’ve gone through all our major markets and sort of filtered it for our business which is to say where are the markets that maybe have a little bit more than the national average of supplies and that don’t -- where have a big presence or a relatively big presence and that don’t have demand that is exceeding that meaning they have other things going on. And that sort of I think as we run the business, the right filter to look at because some markets are going to have excess supply, more than national average like the Seattle but the demand growth is phenomenal and so the story goes. So, it’s not just supply, it’s supply against demand. And then for us, it’s where do we have a presence. And when I put it through all those filters, New York is obviously sort of the one that continues to stand out. I would say probably the Texas markets, particularly Dallas and Houston because there has been a bunch -- a little bit more supply and they have demand issues, given what’s going on with oil and gas. I would say beyond that, maybe a touch of Miami but demand growth coming in Latin America has been quite strong. So, there is little bit more supply growth but there is also pretty good demand growth. I think we are going to be 7% growth this year in the Miami market. Chicago, a little bit -- which is a market that depends on McCormick, I would say you could look at next year and say maybe Chicago has little bit more. It’s having a great year this year. Chicago is probably having a little bit more supply than we are seeing demand growth because of the convention cycle next year coming out of McCormick. So, maybe Chicago will be sort of a little bit on that list. But that’s sort of the list. And when we look at the percentage other than New York which is 4% of our EBITDA, you go to the Texas market, it’s just one or in change; Miami which I don’t think is an issue is less than 1%, these are -- this is the benefit of diversification and having a very big broad portfolio that not only is sort of spread around the world but spread around the United States. So, I’m not trying to -- there is definitely -- there are some markets that have little more supply than others. I just don’t think -- as we look at it through our filters, it’s not wholesale by any means. There are just a few select places that we think about and where we’d have a little bit more concern. But generally, I think the story across the country is quite intact.
Bill Crow: I appreciate that. Very quickly, Kevin, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about achieving a low investment grade rating midpoint in next year I think or early to mid next year. Is that -- it seems like that’s pushed back a little bit from earlier expectations. Is that fair and why?
Kevin Jacobs: No, I think it’s on track, Bill. I think that’s where we think the credit profile will get into the zone. We’d originally said three to four when we came out and we are in the fours. And then I think we said last quarter on our call that we had refined that range just in thinking with in discussions with the rating agencies and how they look at the business because they think about the business differently as you get into different portions of the cycle. So, I would say plus or minus on track.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Felicia Hendrix: Chris, going back to your outlook for group next year, I believe, if I heard this correctly, you said that it was up in the mid single digits for 2016; is that on rates or bookings, both?
Chris Nassetta: That is in both. I think the best I remember is, it’s two-thirds rate 60:40 rate….
Felicia Hendrix: And then can you just take us further to what you’re seeing in terms of the complexion of that demand? Are you seeing different industries, industry switch and are you seeing more or less sensitivity to rates or bookings, some color F&B, just any kind of detail you can give what you’re seeing?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean there are few things as we’ve been looking at and that I think are interesting but not inconsistent with what you would think. I think in terms of the types of business, the growth is coming predominantly in corporate groups but the big association groups are coming back. So, the average size group is getting a little bit bigger, not surprisingly as you get into the group cycle coming back in a more fulsome way. The length of the booking window has extended. Actually ran stats across all size groups last week with our guides. And it’s a month to a month and a half extension in the booking cycle because you’re having months which are big group months like October, where we’re running 83%. People get trained to think, wow, there’s no capacity, so I better start booking a little further out. So, I think that’s a good trend but a natural trend. I think in terms of the spend; it depends on any quarter what’s going on. But broadly I think those trends are following what we would expect. If we look at owned and operated hotels this year and what kind of food and beverage catering growth we’re going to see against the RevPAR growth, it’s probably 60% to 70%. Honestly we had probably hoped for it to be a little bit better, little bit more comparable and that has to do with sort of partly the third quarter calendar shifts with that impacting group in the quarter has a meaningful impact on the full year. But generally I think that spend trends are headed in the good direction. As you get the bigger groups coming back which we’re seeing, in corporate groups I think you will continue to see the food and beverage spend sort of tick up naturally. So, I guess those are few things that maybe fun facts but I think again are interesting. And that’s what you should expect to see as group comes back and we are.
Felicia Hendrix: That’s helpful. And then switching gears, Kevin, obviously you guys are very clearly focused on driving shareholder value and I thank you all for the color in terms of just reminding us that we’re going to get an update when you next report. But just thinking, how are you thinking about your strategic options given the decline in REITs and timeshare multiples?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, I think Chris said it before, Felicia, so I am probably not going to say too much more, as you can probably imagine. But we don’t think about this really any differently than we thought about it before. These are long-term decisions we’re making to drive shareholder value, as we mentioned. And so we’re still thinking about it the same way.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent: Just a couple of questions. You mentioned earlier that your timeshare sales were little bit better in the quarter based on timing, and I just wanted to understand little bit of what was going into that. Also just as an aside just because it’s interesting, because a lot of your growth is coming in Asia, you announced the partnership with Plateno to build 400 Hampton Inns in China over the next few years. You did that back in October 2014 and now Plateno has been acquired. So, does this change your ability to grow into that market? And then just one final question, because I just think it’s interesting. Occupancy is at very, very high levels right now. And as you noted, it’s been a little bit hard to push rate. Is there anything, Chris or Kevin, you can change structurally that makes it harder to push rate higher when the inelasticity is pretty high?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I’ll maybe take the second and third and let Kevin take the timeshare one, and in reverse order maybe. On occupancy -- first of all, I don’t believe, I said we’re having a hard time; I said we can always do better is what I recall saying and that we’re driving the majority of our -- in these high occupancy periods, the majority of our growth is coming in rate. So I mean I think we are achieving that. What I think it has do with, Steve, honestly more than anything is just sort of what has been, how much air is in the balloon generally from a macroeconomic point of view. And that is to say, this has been - we’ve had reasonable demand growth but not sort of skyrocketing demand growth. The reason that we have been able to deliver these mid single digits RevPAR numbers because we had such a dramatic decline in capacity. So, I think there is obviously more transparency. We had transparency for a while, maybe it’s getting -- of course it’s getting better but we have had pretty good transparency for a while. I think it has to do more with the fact that this recovery has been a very tepid recovery. And as a result, if you look at what’s going on in corporate America, there is always -- there is not sort of a really robust feeling that exists out there that you would have had with a more robust recovery that would help you push rates even further. So, as a percentage of our overall growth, it’s following a natural curve in my opinion relative to what the macro conditions are giving us. And I don’t think honestly that there is any -- I think it’s over thinking as to go a whole lot further than that personally, based on experience. On the Plateno, Jin Jiang, we have obviously had a good relationship with Plateno. We have been well aware long before this became publicly -- public knowledge about they were doing with Jin Jiang. And I think our attitude is that it makes them a better, stronger partner because they become bigger, better, stronger. They remained as we do committed to the things that we’re trying to do together in China with Hampton. So, I think based on everything we’ve seen and talking with throughout the process of their discussion with Jin Jiang, what we see in actual production on the development side, they are ahead of all their targets. They seem unbelievably focused on achieving success in this relationship. and I have every reason to believe that based on what they’ve said and what I see.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Then Steve, on a timeshare question, it’s interesting, our full year outlook -- the timing difference is really not on the sales side, our full year outlook is still in the high teens for overall sales for the year. As you know from covering the business, it’s really earnings recognition that can have differences in timing. So that’s all it is.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Two questions on supply, the first one just around -- is there -- it’s a simple question, sorry. Would it be able to – could one adjust for your geographic and maybe chain scale exposure and get a supply forecast, maybe compare it or more qualitatively, how it compared to STR’s forecast? And second question, there was an interesting article on the Wall Street Journal; I think it was last week about all the soft brands and highlighting potential risk to DoubleTree. You obviously had positive comments about unit growth there; just wanted to hear your latest thinking about that potential risk. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: I think we are doing everything in reverse order. I’ll take the second one and get Kevin the first. On the soft brands actually, I think if you get in detail what’s going on with DoubleTree is that we have had an unbelievable success story for a whole bunch of reasons. When we got here net team eight years ago, we really viewed DoubleTree, particularly as the market started to go and decline, as a unique opportunity for growth, unique in the sense that none of the big global brands was outplaying in the space sort of below the core up or upscale space in full service, almost a bridge between limited service and full service. And our view is as if we reinvent DoubleTree from a product service point of view to sort of get into that strata, we can really drive a great customer experience but defiantly drive great market share and great unit growth, and that’s exactly what happened. And thankfully our competitors gave us a very wide berth. So in that six years or whatever, we took market share from not being at fair share. We increased it I would say 700 or 800 basis points. And even taking out 10% of the system at the bottom that didn’t meet the quality standards we doubled the size of the brand. And we continue to have great amazing momentum as it has been and will continue to be a great engine of growth for conversions and new builds. I mean doing plenty of new builds in other places around the world, obviously not much of any full service stuff getting done in the U.S. We clearly -- it sounds like -- Marriott had said they bought Delta to compete with it. That’s what I hear and that’s what I read in read in the papers. And others are doing other things. Clearly we will have some competition. We are not afraid of competition, makes us better. We think DoubleTree has been, continues to be unique; it has a huge global pipeline that is way ahead of what anybody else is doing. And ultimately the best test is in market share. So, a lot of these upstarts ultimately at the moment don’t have the value in my opinion, don’t have the same value propositions to deliver for the ownership community which is a premium market share that we have been able to deliver into the DoubleTree brand. So, we think there will be more competition. It’s a competitive world. We feel really good about what we will be able to do in that world.
Kevin Jacobs: And Thomas on the supply side, the short answer is we have very broad diversification, as you know, particularly in the United States, if you are talking about that. And so we tend to become pretty much an index. And so while I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, I’d say it really wouldn’t be any different of the supply story in our markets waited for our markets and places where we would have more supply, obviously we’re 20%, plus or minus 20% of the rooms under construction in the U.S. versus 10% of the installed base. So we are getting more of our fair share. But I think as Chris has said before, we are getting more of our fair share in the places where there is more demand for the product and where our brands compete quite effectively. So, I don’t think the story is any different on supply for us than it is for the industry overall.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Vince Ciepiel : First question on unit growth, as you look at signings in the quarter and the positive reception to your new midscale brand than the ramp in some of the newer products like Home2 and Homewood, what’s the unit growth setup heading into next year versus the same time last year heading into ‘15?
Chris Nassetta: I think accelerating in terms of singings and in actual deliveries. We are going to sign this year as I said in our prepared comments, hopefully a 100,000 or close to a 100,000 rooms. That’s the biggest I think anybody has ever done; certainly the biggest we’ve done; I think it’s the biggest anybody has ever done in a year in the industry. And by the way that’s no midscale; that will be probably in that pipeline that will probably be zero or maybe a de minimis number. So that will incrementally add to it. And let’s take a little bit of time to get that launched in and ramped. But I think given the product and the price point and the shorter gestation period, you are going to see that be productive at a fairly rapid pace. So, I think we think things are accelerating modestly off a great year this year; they are accelerating modestly into next.
Vince Ciepiel: Great, thanks. And then finally, looking at occupancy in the U.S., it looks like you are up 120 bps year-to-date which puts you at 78%. Just wondering of the higher occupancy in most of the brands I think domestically, how is that compared to your initial expectations heading into the year and maybe you can kind of comment on what you are seeing domestic group, domestic transient and maybe the impact from the inbound arrivals; how it’s tracked versus that initial expectation?
Chris Nassetta: I think the short answer is it’s generally consistent with expectations for the year within a minor rounding error. So, we think next year, as I described, a lot more of the growth is going to come through rates, so much more modest occupancy gains overall. There are lots of factors sort of moving it one way or another. International has obviously been from a volume point of view, a bit of a drag but there are other things that have been sort of benefitting us, most particularly the group as we’ve all been waiting for that group cycle to get more in full swing. We are starting to see that. And that’s a very healthy thing for the business because it not only gives us more occupancy and builds the base but it allows us ultimately to leverage off of that base to drive more rate growth which is in part why you are seeing 75% to 80% of our RevPAR growth forecasted next year to be on the rate side. So, I think it’s generally consistent with what we thought and next year is consistent with what we would expect to see at this stage of the cycle.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Joel Simkins: Chris, as you think about your ability to take price over the next year or so, how much does the kind of the airline industry is factoring to the mix? Obviously they have taken up price. And I have to imagine your corporate partners do think about kind of the total travel costs. So, does that in anyway sort of crimp your ability to kind of continue to push through a rate?
Chris Nassetta: I guess the answer would be sort of logical yes, it would at some point. I don’t think the airlines are moving their rate so much that it’s really -- that we’re seeing any impact and will watch it carefully. But I ultimately think both of us are moving our rates because of underlying fundamentals of sort of the laws of supply and demand. They are doing what they do to limit capacity to drive prices up; we have limited capacity because not a lot of people are adding. So, if the balloon is still with air, meaning the broader economy continues to go, I think it gives us pricing power. So, I don’t see based on the current trajectory of what they are doing what the economy is doing that that crimps what we think we will deliver.
Joel Simkins: And one quick follow-up here, as we think about CapEx for 2016, is it a little too early to start commenting on that or should we expect to hear any sort of detail around specific hotel projects; could you update us on with the real estate?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, we are going -- Kevin can comment, but we’re going to give you obviously; now we’re just giving you sort of the high level like we always do this time of year. We are not done with our budget process; we will give you that on our next call. I would say as a leading indicator because we’re pretty far down the line and nothing unusual in CapEx, nothing out of the norm from what we’ve got this year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Your line is open. 
Smedes Rose: I just want to ask, you spoke on supply a little bit and I was just curious if you’re seeing anything on the ground level on the development side, on the ability to access financing either in core U.S. markets where it does seem like there is a little bit of an uptick in supply, you mentioned Chicago and we see -- obviously there’s lot coming in New York. So, core markets versus secondary markets; is one remain easier than the other; do you feel like overall developers can get development loans or maybe what do you think…
Chris Nassetta: I would say, overall it’s still hard. I would say, only the best developers with the best brands are getting financed. And I know that sounds like I’m being partial to our brands and I am but it happens to be true. So I don’t think there’s indiscriminate lending going on. I think it is heavily underwritten with the best of the best, both owner and brand. I would say, if you look at it statistically, more of its getting financed in secondary and tertiary markets. It’s almost all limited service, okay and it remains that. You haven’t seen it creep up with lots of full service or any real luxury; I mean there is spattering stuff but it’s almost all limited service. If you look at the bulk of the numbers, it’s in secondary and tertiary markets because for a simple reason that’s where it has made the most economic sense and in part an issue that people don’t talk about enough because it’s hard to scientifically sort of prove it out but there is more massive obsolescence issues in those secondary and tertiary markets where what -- you may not have a hotel that’s going out of supply that a Hampton or Garden Inn or a Homewood is replacing but you have hotels that are sort of past their useful life. They’re going to stay open; they’re not going to bulldoze them but they’re going to down the scale of brands and price point. And so in reality, they are not truly in our competitive set. That obsolescence issue is much more -- it’s much more of a secondary and tertiary market issue which is why I think you see the bulk of that development going on there. There obviously a spattering of it going on in the urban markets, still mostly limited service but I think it’s been on a normal path. I’ve seen developers are saying the best developers with the best brands are able to selectively get money. That’s the way it’s been for the last six months; that’s the way it is now.
Smedes Rose: And then I guess kind of a similar question on China, I think we were pleasantly surprised by your very positive commentary on China despite lowered economic expectations for that market. And I think you did mention that the luxury and the high end, maybe it’s a little bit slower on the development side versus the more midscale, could you maybe just provide a little more color on what you’re seeing there?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, we’ve been trying to provide a little ton more color honestly but then what I said, but we’ve been saying this to everybody, to you guys and everybody else that for the last two or three years and we’ve been working for longer than that on sort of adapting our strategy. Because it was obvious to us few years ago that on the development side a lot of what was going on at the high-end of the business may not have been totally economically rational based on the hotel economics but was part of mass infrastructure build and huge investment going in to real estate which got a bit bubbly in China and that Chinese government has tried to manage the deflation of that real estate balloon without having it spark, a contagion in the rest of their economy. They’ve done a reasonably good job of doing that honestly but in so doing they’ve been reallocating capital and lending out of that space and into other things. And the market is by definition from a development point of view in the hotel space, becoming more economically rational. What’s more economically rational there over the long-term just like it is in other markets as they mature like the U.S. or Europe is really the mid market opportunities, particularly in secondary and tertiary markets. So, we anticipated that. It is just obvious that this was eventually going to happen.  China, if you draw a line to it, it’s a line that goes up but it’s not without ups and downs as it does its. And it was obvious long-term for us to create the same network effect that we have in other parts of world, particularly in the U.S. and Europe then we needed broad distribution and that only over the long-term economically rational things we’re going to get done and those things were going to be really more in the mid-market with our limited service brands. So, we two and three years ago repositioned our products for those markets, built out relationships with owners and in the case of Hampton with Plateno, over an extended period of time and now we’re getting really good traction. We think that over time like the U.S., like Europe, that will be the bulk of the growth. What we’re trying also say that doesn’t mean that full service and luxury isn’t going to happen in China; over time that’s going to be a big growth business, it’s just kind of ebb and flow where I think the limited service businesses going to be more steady because of just more markets in China that are applicable. So, it’s not unlike what we did in Europe five to six years ago when a lot of people bailed out on Europe, when it had all its troubles, we said why would we bail out, what we out to do is change the trajectory and have a value strategy with conversions to DoubleTree. And then if it’s going to be new-build, it’s going to be a super efficient Hampton or Garden Inn type opportunity. We shifted to the strategy there and we have our pipelines twice as big as the next closest pipeline. And we’ve been delivering hotels in that market at a much more rapid pace. So, the idea of being China, Europe, U.S., you got the right brands in the right segments and you are quick on your feets and you are really strategic about it, you should be able to grow all the time in good times and bad by deploying by these brands and building the right relationships with the right partners in these various parts of the world including China.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: A lot of ground covered today, so thanks for the commentary. One very quick question regarding buybacks. I’m just curious if you can comment on any potential limitations or other sensitivities around potentially buying back Blackstone shares in addition to the ones that flow publicly?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Rich, I think that we would probably not do that. It’s something that’s impossible but I think it’s very difficult for them to sell the company shares. But I don’t think it changes the dynamic and the way we think about capital allocation and its ability to have the desired effects.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: A quick question about the business transient customer. We heard on other calls that there has been a lot of short term cancellations. Are you seeing this trend as well and are you going to look to lengthen your -- or I guess strengthen your cancellation fee to maybe lengthen them.
Chris Nassetta: On the second first and that’s the trend today. Yes, we are looking at and testing a bunch of different options on lengthening and cancellation fees and the other things to address generally tying our inventory up for lengths of time without having people have to pay for it. And that’s something we think is sensible. But that’s for a whole bunch of reasons. It’s not because we are seeing any short term cancellation activities that’s outside of what we’ve been seeing. Obviously with all these new technologies and things over the last couple of years, there has been lots of different sort of ways people are trying to game all our systems with cancel and rebook. And when there is no cost to it, the system has risk of gaming. And so that’s what we’re really addressing. But in terms of what we’ve seen in October or whatever, there is not nothing new or unusual. That’s business as usual. We should be looking at our cancel policies and where we have fees and things just because it’s the right thing to do in the new world order.
Wes Golladay: And then looking at some of these high occupancy, low ADR growth markets like New York in particular, is the inability -- we’re talking about inability to push rate but is ADR just dropping because of a mix shift issue? Wondering more specifically how your corporate negotiated rates are going in New York.
Chris Nassetta: I think our corporate negotiated rates in New York are consistent with what we’re seeing everywhere else. Remember that’s not -- it’s kind of looking at Kevin -- I think our corporate negotiated in New York is probably 20% maybe, 17% to 20% of the -- maybe less, 15% to 20% of the business. So, in that arena, I think we will achieve those kinds of rates because we are pushing our core customer generally across the country pretty hard and whether they are in New York or wherever they might be. I think the inability to drive rates in New York has had mostly to do, even though it’s high occupancy, there has been a lot of -- there has been a lot of supply. And there hasn’t honestly been enough rate discipline and it doesn’t take many to sort of not have discipline before everybody is forced to follow. So, while it’s high occupancy, there’s still a lot of rooms that have been coming in that market to sort of to keep a lid on it.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. I think New York is pretty unique in that regard as a market that runs that level of occupancy and has had impacts from supply. Frankly New York has needed the capacity -- it hasn’t been great for our business but it’s really been a lack of compression issue…
Chris Nassetta: And it’s a mix, to your question embedded in it. You are right, it’s a mix thing. So it’s still running high occupancies even with all those rooms coming in but it’s with the mix that is not ideal. Yes, you can run it; you fill it; incrementally you make more profit but if you had fewer rooms, you would have a better mix and you would have a higher paying customer and you would be able to leverage rates more. So Kevin, is right. New York is quite unique in the country.
Wes Golladay: And just a quick one on distribution. We’ve seen some of the OTAs consolidate. How are you doing on your negotiations on the commissions with them and are you starting to get the customer to book more direct now and how is the mobile front going?
Chris Nassetta: We are that’s a quite a good last question because it can take a while but the short version of that is we can’t obviously for a whole lot of reasons -- this goes exactly what we’ve done in those negotiations. I said on the last call or maybe a couple of calls ago, we had three sort of pillars in our negotiations with all our OTAs, one was that we wanted to get rid of last room availability; two, we wanted we have the opportunity to have preferential pricing to our most loyal customers; and three, we wanted to continue to move our margins down to more reasonable levels. We are now done. While I can’t be specific unfortunately contractually, we are done with all of our OTA negotiations and we achieved our goals in every one of those pillars. And we are definitely seeing more activity on direct booking; we’re seeing a most growth in any of our segments coming through our direct channels; and we are very focused over the next year or two and making sure that our customer understands the value preposition that we offer them to drive even more of a direct relationship in terms of booking with us.
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Chris Nassetta for closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, guys. We have taken too much of your time this morning. So, I will end it just by saying we appreciate everybody participating. We had good healthy discussion about lots of different things that are going in the industry. We feel great about things and we look forward to catching up with you after the year is done. Have a great day.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation. This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Christian Charnaux, you may begin.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Leann. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide second quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements; and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today.

This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher Nassetta: Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another strong quarter with adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share above the high end of our guidance. We continue to feel great about the fundamentals, which should continue to support strong performance going forward. As a result, we've raised our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. Given our confidence in the outlook and the significant deleveraging we've achieved, we are also pleased to commence returning capital to shareholders with the declaration this morning of our first quarterly cash dividend. Kevin will cover this in more detail later in his remarks, but we intend to grow our dividend over time as earnings grow, and we believe we should be able to initiate these share buyback program next year. Turning to our performance in the quarter, system-wide comp RevPAR grew 5.2% on a currency-neutral basis. May was somewhat softer than expected largely due to weaker transient business caused by weather in the Southern and Central U.S. and demand declined across oil and gas markets, impacting quarterly RevPAR growth by approximately a 100 basis points. However, trading growth for the quarter was still relatively strong, up a little over 5% system-wide and strengthened significantly in June continuing into July. Group business was strong in the quarter as system-wide group revenue increased over 6% at our comp owned Americas owned and operated hotels largely during my company meetings that were up over 10% in the quarter, with particular strength in the Chicago, New Orleans and Hawaii markets. Favorable mix shifts also combined to support ancillary spend with F&B as owned and operating hotels growing 7% in the quarter. Group position continues to track up in the mid-single digits for both the balance of this year, and into 2016. We expect to see a strong second half of the year and group with the fourth quarter outpacing the third quarter largely due to holiday shifts. Turning to development. Our system continues to both - our system growth continues to both lead the industry and gain in momentum. According to Star, we increased our industry leading position in both pipeline and rooms under entering on the construction in the quarter. We are on track to have a record number of signings this year roughly 90,000 rooms continuing to grow the largest pipeline in our company's history, all with de minimis amounts of our capital and no acquisitions. In the quarter, we opened 82 hotels totaling more than 11,000 rooms bringing our total supply to 4,440 properties and more than 730,000 rooms. With the opening of the Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort and Hilton Garden Inn, Guatemala City earlier this month. We are now present in 97 countries and territories. Including all approved deals our pipeline stands at nearly 265,000 rooms. As of today, we have 1 million rooms open or under development and expect to be in 100 countries and territories by the end of the year. Net unit growth adds to our ability to serve customers anywhere in the world for any traveling they have, driving significant loyalty to our systems that continue to enhance our industry leading RevPAR index premiums. To serve even more customers, we continue to globally deploy our existing brands and launch new brands like Home2, Curio and Canopy and soon a new midscale brand. We now have nearly 60 Home2s open with over 225 more in the pipeline. Year-to-date, we have signed or approved nearly 80 new Home2s and continue to build significant momentum with developers. Curio has celebrated its first anniversary with nearly 50 properties and 13,000 rooms open or in various stages of development, and with its first international hotels opening this month in the Caribbean, Europe, and Latin America. We also continue to see tremendous interest from owners in Canopy with over 20 hotels and 3,500 rooms either in the pipeline or within signed letters of intent. We expect in the first Canopy to open in Reykjavik, Iceland, early next year. We intend to launch our new midscale brand in the first quarter of 2016 largely targeting new customers for our system at a price point below the Hampton brand. We believe the target market is about 40% of U.S. room night demand, demand that our current system largely does not serve. We have already received tremendous interest from our owners on this brand and our goal is to have a system size larger than Hampton over time with next to no capital investment are acquired. Our portfolio brands from Waldorf to Hampton and soon to include our midscale brand are linked together by our Hilton HHonors program and our enhanced HHonors app is at the center of making our system more rewarding and attractive to guests. Fully integrated into our backend systems, the HHonors app allow guests to check-in and select the room at over 4,100 hotels globally today with straight to room capabilities via a digital key now ruling out its scale with hundreds of hotels expected to offer the service by year-end. Our award winning HHonors app has been downloaded nearly 5 million times, and nearly one in four HHonors arrivals are using digital check-in and room selection today. Totally nearly 5 million digital check-ins a day and approaching 1 million mobile check-ins per month. Guest’s feedback has been really positive with the HHonors app receiving the highest average Apple store customer rating amongst all hotel apps since its re-launch. Now let me update you on the outlook for the reminder of the year. Overall, the fundamentals of the cycle remain very solid, and we continue to expect 5% to 7% system-wide RevPAR growth in 2015. In the U.S., we expect 5% to 7% RevPAR growth for the full year supported by favorable supply and demand dynamics and growing group business, particularly in the fourth quarter, although we expect continued pressure from softening European and Japanese inbound travel. Decreases should be mitigated by continued upticks in inbound travel from other markets particularly from China and strong domestic leisure business. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we anticipate mid single digit RevPAR growth for the full year supported by solid trends in Mexico, Peru and Columbia which should be more - which should more than outlay challenges in Brazil where economic softness continue. We maintain our mid single digit RevPAR growth expectations for Europe although prolonged challenges in France and Eastern Europe continue to temper our regional performance. Leisure trends remain very strong particularly throughout Spain and Italy as robust international inbound travel in greater local demand drive strong transient business. For the Middle East, Africa region we forecast low single digit RevPAR growth for the year as decreasing inbound demand from Russia, Germany and Turkey continues to weigh on results in Saudi Arabia and UAE. This inbound weakness should be largely offset by strengthening fundamental and easy comparisons in Egypt. In the Asia-Pacific region, we continue to expect high single digit RevPAR growth supported by strong fundamentals in Japan, positive momentum in Thailand and solid performance in China. We continue to forecast 6% to 8% RevPAR growth in China for the full year, despite decelerating economic growth due mostly to our favorable market mix and rising market share. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance as well as the setup for the remainder of this year and in the next. We also remain very focused first and foremost on creating long term value for shareholders including exploring possible structural options for the company. I know many of you are curious about the potential for time share or real estate spin opportunities, and I can tell you that we continue to explore all options and still plan to give you a full update before the year's out. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for further details on the quarterly results and the outlook for the rest of the year. Kevin.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks Chris, good morning everyone. During the quarter our RevPAR growth of 5.2% was driven by a 3.4% increase in average rate and a 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy. In actual dollar system line RevPAR per increased 2.9%. RevPAR growth was 5.8% for the first half of the year roughly two-thirds driven by rate. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.25 an increase of 19% versus the prior year period and above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was $777 million an increase of 15% year-over-year. Beating the high end of our guidance by approximately $17 million. SP growth significantly outperformed expectations and FX headwinds were lower than expected. We attribute $5 million to $10 million of the beat to timing items that should normalize during the back half of the year. For the quarter enterprise wide adjusted EBITDA margins were up 320 basis points year-over-year to 41.8%. Management franchise fees were $434 million in the quarter, up 17% over the second quarter of 2014 driven by strong franchise sales, new unit growth and accelerated timing of certain items including change of ownership and termination fees. We continue to grow fees by increasing effective franchise rates through the second quarter, we have approved the relicensing of over above 275 hotels this year, more than double the pace of last year. Resulting in a net increase of franchise rates from 4.6% to 5.5% in those hotels or an estimated fee increase of more than $10 million annually. For the fee business overall, we expect growth in the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter to de-accelerate relative to the first half. Again, this is mostly owing to accelerated timing of fees booked earlier in the year than we initially anticipated. Tougher comparisons to last year and someone high [indiscernible] that benefited in prior year results. The ownership segment opposed to adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of $318 million, up approximately 9% versus the prior year. Results were driven by robust fundamentals and were boosted by performance in Chicago, Japan, New Orleans and the recently acquired 1031 exchange assets in Florida and San Francisco outperforming there underwriting. Costs savings, including lower energy prices further feel the segments outperformance and supported margin expansion of 200 basis points. Timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $86 million in the quarter, up 21% versus the prior year period. Performance within line with our expectations and we continue to expect timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $335 million to $315 million - $350 million for full year 2015. We continue to grow our timeshare supply with fee for service deals that require no capital on our part. Including two recent capital-light deals a condo-to-hotel conversion in Orlando and a new build tower in Myrtle beach. Our current timeshare supply totals nearly 136,000 inner goals or about six years of sales at our current pace with over 83% of those developed by third parties. Finally, our corporate and other segment was $61 million for the quarter, slightly better than expectations. Moving on to regional results. In the U.S. RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year comparable system wide hotels. As Chris mentioned, results were pressured by severe weather and flooding in key areas of the country, demand declines across key oil markets most notably Houston where RevPAR dropped 5.7% in the quarter as well as by tough year-over-year comparisons. More broadly, we continue to see solid fundamentals supported by increasing rate and strong leisure transient revenue which was up over 8% in the quarter. Trends in New York improved sequentially aided by both transient and group performance. Inbound travel to the U.S. from Continental Europe declined 1% through June which has impacted gateway cities. However, some markets like San Francisco and Hawaii have seen increased demand from other countries including China and Australia mitigate weaker European travel. And the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 6.8% driven primarily by strength in Mexico, Peru and Chile which was somewhat offset by Brazil where performance was hit particularly hard given prolonged economic softness from lower commodity prices. RevPAR in Europe increased 4.6% as solid leisure trends supported by rising inbound travel offset softer group volumes in Germany, Spain and the UK. Inbound travel from the U.S. to Continental Europe grew 65 year-to-date through June, and strong vacation bookings continue into the third quarter. The Middle East and Africa region posted modest RevPAR growth of 2.5%, despite the sustained recovery in Egypt declining inbound continued to win fundamentals on the Arabian and Peninsula. In the Asia Pacific region, RevPAR gains of 9.4% were driven by nearly 19% growth in Japan, which benefited from strong transient rates as well as continued improvement in Thailand and strong trends in China. Corporate and leisure demand coupled with market share gains supported over 10% RevPAR growth in Mainland China despite some softness in the country's broader economy. Turning to capital allocation, we reduced long-term debt by $175 million in the quarter, and prepaid an additional $350 million on our term loan this month, using the net proceeds from the Hilton Sydney sale. This brings total debt reduction year-to-date of $750 million. As Chris mentioned, we will begin returning capital to shareholders through a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share, payable on September 25, to shareholders of record on August 14. We intend to grow the dividend over time and maintaining a target payout ratio of 30% to 40% of recurring cash flow, which we defined as adjusted EBITDA, less debt service, CapEx, taxes and working capital. Our goal remains to achieve an investment grade credit rating, which we believe will maximize equity value over the long-term. Going forward, we anticipate returning recurring cash flow in excess of a market dividend to shareholders through a programmatic share buybacks. Based on our anticipated credit profile, we believe this could occur in the second quarter or third quarter next year. We ended the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times, and expect to end the year below 3.5 times after factoring for dividend payments. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are maintaining system-wide RevPAR growth guidance of between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusting for the sale of the Hilton Sydney which closed early this month, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance range by $20 million at the mid-point to $2.82 billion to $2.87 billion. Our full year guidance continues to assume approximately $16 million related to FX impacts for the year. To the third quarter of 2015, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. Adjusted EBITDA of between $730 million and $750 million, and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our second quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We'd now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Leann can we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis: Good morning everyone.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Harry Curtis: Just wanted to ask you a bigger picture question. Investor’s single biggest concern is that the lodging demand and pricing are decelerating that the cycle is over. So I wonder if you could give maybe a bit more 'meat around the bone' that gives you confidence that Hilton can enjoy pricing power in the 5% to 7% range for an extended period that the cycle really has ample room to run? Harry, I'm happy to do it, I know that prime on everybody's mind particularly given what I've seen volatility in the markets and as others have reported. I think my philosophy on this is quite simple and frankly quite consistent, which is I think we're in a very, very nice part of the cycle. I don't feel any different in that regard than I felt over the last several quarters. I think that is supported not to over simplify it, but I think it is supported by the basic laws of economics, okay. And that is, as I look at the world or I look at the U.S. market which still represents in our large part of - nearly 80% of our EBITDA. We have an economy that is certainly not roaring, but is showing reasonably stable growth with the potential that have a slight uptick in growth. The demand for rooms - the hotel rooms follows very closely, it's on a very high correlation to that. We are seeing decent demand growth for rooms that is being matched by historically - continuing historically low supply level. So it was less than 1%. We're now clicking a little bit over 1% in 2015. It will go up a little bit from there. Recognizing the 30 year averages 2.5% and by the way in my history of many, many cycle, it is not at the average that you typically run into supply problems, and I think we're long, long way from the average. So, I think if the U.S. economy maintains moderate growth rate based on what we can see from the standpoint of where that pipeline is and what supply growth is going to be. I think you've got several years of running, remember you can feel very good. Now every quarter can be a little bit different here and there, depending transient things that go on line like, we had go on in May or group - the way groups cycle through, but it should clearly in my opinion support growth, which is what I have been saying very consistently over the last couple of years and for the next couple of years it should clearly support growth in the 5% to 7% range, which is what we have been delivering. If you look at the - break it down by segments, I think it should make you feel good, it makes me feel good. You look at what's going on in transient, you had a little hiccup in May, but related to very specific things, but June has been very strong and strong in the highest rated segments of transient. Leisure transient is quite strong and then you go to the group side and we gave you some of the stats, that the group pace has been good, the position is good both and the rest of the year and looking out the 2016, quite strong and strong in company meeting which is honestly where you'd really like as much as anywhere to see it, shield that strength and so not only do the [indiscernible] of economics and sort of the macro conditions make me feel good, but when I look at the micro conditions of the various important segments of our business and where they are going and what we see on the books and consumer behavior it makes me feel awfully good. Last point and I know, just because this is on everybody's mind, so were taking a little bit time on, I know this, my sense is that people are being getting sort of less enthusiastic about the cycle over the last six weeks or eight weeks. It's interesting as I said at this very table, I mean, our board room every Monday morning, and I talked to my whole team around the world including the three president that run our mega regions and I end the week talking to the three of them as well, and I am going to tell you over the last six weeks or eight weeks that they haven't been - by region and I now saying amongst all of them they haven't been getting slightly more negative or neutral, they began slightly more positive in their views of what's going on in our three big mega regions. So, okay that's anecdotal, but I mean, just sort of the atmospherics of what we see in real hard data and the atmosphere, the data that we see, hard data makes you feel good, but the atmosphere, I should say around just how we [indiscernible] our teams feels around the world about where things are going is quite positive as well. So, I think, I will declare from my and our point of view, we think the cycle is alive and well, we're very confident in being able to do deliver what we were suggesting to you that we're going to deliver this year, and we think that the good times continue.
Harry Curtis: That takes care of it for me. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from line of Joe Greff from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joseph Greff: Good morning everybody, and thank you...
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Greff: ...and thanks for the prospectus, Chris. Kevin when you're looking at the 3Q guidance, the 4.5% to 6.5% which I think is probably reassuring relative to what others have talked about to the 3Q. On a currency adjusted basis, how do you see that? And then what's the assumption for the U.S. properties in that one - 6.5...
Kevin Jacobs: The 4.5% to 6.5% I assume - mean that the 4.5% to 6.5% is FX neutral, so what it would be at actual rates. I think I would be a 0.2% to lower than that at actual rates. And then, the U.S. is consistent with that outlook.
Joseph Greff: Got it. And then which in the last couple of quarters we've seen relatively stronger growth?
Christopher Nassetta: And Joe that - and Joe we covered it sort of indirectly, that the reason is they have that pick down really as everything to do with sort of the holiday calendar in - in the third quarter. With just the effect of the calendar is shifting some business is just waiting fourth quarter, particularly on the group side more than the third quarter, the full second half of the year looks [indiscernible] bit more waiting in fourth quarter versus and third quarter, and so that half a point is the reflection of that.
Joseph Greff: So would you expect the second half U.S. to be consistent with the growth that you saw in the first half?
Christopher Nassetta: Generally, yes.
Joseph Greff: Great. That's it from me. Thanks very much guys.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi thanks. I guess just along the same lines here, sort of - so in order to achieve the higher end of your RevPAR growth for the year, we're going to need to see RevPAR kind of pick up at a pretty healthy pace through the second half, and I know you have your range there. But if you had to kind of lean one way or the other, would you be kind of towards the higher or kind of mid part of that range?
Christopher Nassetta: Well, I'd say couple things. I think you're doing the math, right, so yes, it does imply a pickup and I do think that what you will see I think you will see sequentially the third quarter RevPAR numbers be higher than second quarter, and I think the fourth quarter at least as we look at our forecast, particularly, given that really stronger base will be higher than the third quarter. I would say for the full year [indiscernible] gave you a range, I'd probably direct it to the middleish of the range.
Smedes Rose: And then just, Kevin just to clarify in the management and fee income for the quarter, you said, there were $5 million to $10 million of sort of for lack of a better word, one-time items in there...
Kevin Jacobs: Yes.
Smedes Rose: ...is that all in that line? Okay.
Kevin Jacobs: That's right.
Smedes Rose: Even if you adjust for those, it seems like growth in the second quarter was a little above the high-end of your range, and I am just wondering through the back half for the year, you just sort of being trying to be conservative there or is there something that would kind of slowdown that pace of growth?
Kevin Jacobs: No, I think there is couple of things have planned with me, one is the timing as you mentioned, I mean there is something that materialized, earlier in the year then we thought and then in the fourth quarter last year, we had some one-time items that created a little bit tougher comps on the growth rate basis.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Can you quantify what the amount loss in that fourth quarter last year, or?
Kevin Jacobs: No. We could take you through some of the modeling offline, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't one against to come out.
Smedes Rose: All right, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix from Barclay. Your line is open.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi, thank you. Just switching gears for a moment to your pipeline. Chris, just was your new unit openings and your development pipelines seems to be efficiently waited source of the U.S. now about 54% international versus [indiscernible] 60% when guys hedge IPO. I just am wondering what you think is causing the shift in international market. What do you think gets the new construction development reinvigorated?
Christopher Nassetta: You've got those numbers, exactly right. The IPO was 64 they announced, 54, 46. And I think, here's that I say, I mean, obviously the different parts of the world move in a different cadence, the U.S. development side particularly in a limited service base has been picking up steam, you can see it in our numbers and some others numbers. And other parts of the world including Europe slowed down now are picking up steam. Asia-Pac compared to where it was has slowed down somewhat. I'd say the Middle East is generally consistent. What I'd love is, and we did talk a lot about at the IPO is, at our scale and with the breadth of chain scale diversification we have, we have the ability to sort of ebb and flow with market conditions and went everywhere. So, the idea is, there are going to be times where, and we saw it for the five years leading up to maybe last year that China and Asia-Pacific are roaring, they're going to be times, and the U.S. and Europe were very slow. Now, Asia-Pacific is slowing somewhat modestly and Europe is finally stabilizing improving a bit. And the development side in the U.S. is starting to pick-up, pick up some steam. So that - this is one of the great things about diversification that, as that's going on, we are making sure that we're really thoughtful about our development strategies, making sure we have the right resources in the right place that we're layering our brands in the right way, that is satisfying both the consumer demand obviously. But also, where the capital is flowing in these various parts of the world. And the idea is that, if we're intelligent and strategic about how we do that, we're going to keep growing and we're going to grow in an accelerated pace, no matter what's going on in the world, because the world is a big place, and it's diversified world and we're going to be able to continue to gain momentum by being intelligent. So that what we've seen is just what I said, the U.S. and Europe now are picking up a little bit providing a little bit more of the growth up until in 2010 through 2013 when we went public. The U.S. had little or nothing going on, Europe was in stays and Asia Pacific was big part of the story. That's why I like horror story frankly relative to others is that we can do this. We've got 12 of the best brands with the highest market share and create development teams around the world and we push and pull and very strategic about what we're doing around the world to continue to grow our base of hotels to better serve customers where any need they have anywhere in the world they want to be.
Felicia Hendrix: Thanks. And if I could just bring it back to the quarter results for a second, you gave us some very helpful color on the weaker [indiscernible] business in May. Can you just help us understand what percentage of your system wide room count ended up being affected by the weather and the weaker energy demand just to drive the 100 basis points decline in RevPAR?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah, I wouldn't guess if you combine it, so I don't have the exact number so hopefully we'll get back to you, but not insignificant, I would say probably because it was a large swap of the limited service system and franchise system that was really impacted, I would guess 20%. But I'll ask Christian and Joe to take care of that, but we did do the math, I just don't have the number of hotels.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. That's...
Christopher Nassetta: Not, not insignificant.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley from Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Thanks and thanks for taking my question. So just to maybe switch gears and talk a little bit about strategic alternatives. Chris you eluded a little bit about this in your prepared remarks. So the first question I have is, last quarter the only thing we could talk about was M&A and this quarter made it five questions and without asking about it. So, you know how does M&A fit into the strategic alternatives, could you sort of alluded to real estate and timeshare, but didn't mentioned to that. So, how are you thinking about that today, and how that change it all?
Christopher Nassetta: I think, it is not changed. I think, we think about it very consistently with what I've articulated and Kevin and others have articulated before, and that is, we feel really good about the attributes of the company, as they stand, and our ability to expand those attributes organically meaning launching new brands, and as a result, be able to leave the industry in growth and doing in a very capital like way, which we think is going to drive the best returns on equity in the business. And so, I've been pretty clear in saying you'd never say never, I mean, we look at everything that's out there, generally, and you know if there is - we found anything that sort of went through our filter being highly strategic for us and economically compelling in terms of value enhancing to the company, it would be something that we have consider. I will say I don't really see anything that's out there right now that that gets through that filter, and that's because of a good problem we have, which is, getting back to what I started with. We have pretty much in our view what we need to be successful. That doesn't mean, [indiscernible] we're going to launch new brands, we talked about big scale, we just launched two new brands last year, Home2 not too long before that, but given the base size of the company, our scale, our geographic distribution, our existing chain scale distribution, importantly 10,000 owner groups that we have an amazing relationship with, we think that the, the higher return answer for investors - all investors including ourselves is to really focused on our organic growth. So in a simple way, I would say, we are not particularly acquisitive. But we are always trying to be intelligent and thoughtful.
Shaun Kelley: That's very helpful. And then my follow-up would just be, when we think about the other two alternatives in terms of more organic things you can do. The real estate, the regroup which you know as better than anyone on - the evaluations that have come off fairly significantly in the last few weeks and the quality things are volatile. But the question is on does it change in or does the recent change in valuation have a material impact on where you guys are sort of viewing that longer term set of alternatives for the real estate side?
Christopher Nassetta: No, I don't think so. I mean we're really trying to look at this as I've described a couple of times do have very long-term lends, which is when you think about the company is its best - do we think we can create the most value for shareholders over the long-term in our current setup or another setup. And so, it is a very - it is very much a long-term view. We've done a considerable amount of work, and looking at all the options as you can imagine, it's quite complex structurally manageable, but [indiscernible] quite complex, and we want to be really thoughtful about the value levers, because we're not in the business of doing things for practice, we're in the business of doing things that we think are going to create long-term value. So, we have done a lot of work. We'll continue to do a lot of work in - as I said certainly before the end of the year, I think we can layout the rational for how we want to move forward. But these recent ups and downs, I think when we're looking to a longer term lends at least what I've seen so far, it doesn't really have any material impact on our thinking.
Shaun Kelley: Thanks very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning, Chris. I guess maybe to put - maybe a finer point on it is, in products, how are you thinking then about your 2016 RevPAR growth either domestically or globally, just as compared to the pace in 2015. Do you think, it's going to hold or accelerate or even sorry [ph] ?
Christopher Nassetta: I'll go back to what I think I started saying at the IPO. IPO is really good and I said earlier today, Jeff, I think we will be in that 5% to 7% range. We have not started to begin on doing our - into our budgeting process that you actually start, we'll start to kick off in a couple of weeks. But we're in a regular dialogue around the company and with all of our regional heads about their view of this year and next and obviously looking at the pace of bookings, and I think, that the cycle is alive and well, I standby what I said, which is I think, we will be able to for the next couple of years at least deliver RevPAR growth in that time zone, and that - that's what we will be aiming towards.
Jeff Donnelly: And I apologize it. I got on a - a little like, can you talk about your perspective on trends and pricing in China in the next 12 months versus the past 12 months, just given some of the headlines we've been seeing in the - into the market falling and a low with consumption or what not?
Christopher Nassetta: China, obviously, the economic growth story there is one of a bit of deceleration. I think, they're going to great lengths to stabilize their markets to keep consumer confidence high, because in the end they're transitioning that economy to be a consumption-led economy, not unlike ours, and many of the other more mature economies, so I suspect, there'll be some bumps and bruises along the way as they're always are in these things, but that the underlying fundamentals of $1.3 billion people that are no question have ups and downs, but are gaining in wealth that is going to allow them over an extended period of time to accomplish their objective. I think they've been reasonably smart. I suspect they'll continue to be reasonably smart. We are seeing reasonably healthy results in the market. I think the hotel space there is in its nascent stages of development and growth. I mean there're certainly some markets, some of the core markets that maybe have had more development than others, but if you look at representation per room, yeah, thousands of people per room or rooms per thousand people rather in China, it is still much lower than any of the divesting or the developed western economy. So I think any stage you look at the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years and China will have ups and downs but will be a rise up meaning you're going to continue to see a massive amount of development because you're going to have a massive amount of demand coming from their consumers and more people visiting China. When you look at the current trends, I gave you the number we had a great second quarter. We still think will be 6% to 8% for the full year. Some of that is we're getting a network effect and we're gaining market share, I only think that gets better. I think the story is much more - I've been saying this for two years by the way and that's why we've done what we've done. I think it's becoming very much a mid-market story. It's not that you're not going to build more Hiltons and Waldorfs and Conrads. But you're going to build fewer of them and it's going to - the market's going to fill in like it did in other parts of the world, the U.S., in particular which is the most segmented with midscale kind of brands. We're very aggressively trying to do that because that's what's going to build our infrastructure and our network and distribution but you're going to create that network effect like we have in other parts of the world, the U.S. predominantly and Europe as well. So we feel very good about China, I mean if you look at deals being signed in China, it reflects everything I just said, if you look at the staff year-to-date, we signed exactly the same number of deals in China this year as last. Last year 17% for limited service this year 53% for limited services, okay. So there's still whole service and above getting done which is a very different profile and my guess if that's for the year, I think you're going to see the same thing. I actually think we'll sign more deals in the first half, actually I think our deal flow will accelerate the size of the hotels will become much smaller, we'll have a velocity of more deals, more distribution, more in the midscale on limited services side of the business. That's what's going on and it doesn't mean it'll ebb and flow and you'll have surges over time at the high end of the business as well but that's what sort of got and China at the low end of the business got very built out, the high end of the business got reasonably built out. It's really the middle of that sort of missing which is why we focused on it and I think for the next three years, four years, five years that's where the real - that's where the demand is that's where they don't have enough capacity, that's I think economics are good, the money is going to flow through that segment.
Jeff Donnelly: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Hi. Good morning. So a bigger picture on the midscale brand launch you're going to do, I think you said in early 2016 or maybe later this year. If you look at supply growth in the U.S. the one chain scale that's actually seeing decline in supply growth in the U.S. is actually the midscale segment and most of the future construction is an upper mid to upscale. So what gives you guys the confidence that you can clearly developers are choosing to build these other slightly higher chain scale properties over mid-scale. So what gives you guys the confidence that you can kind of launch a brand and change that dynamic?
Christopher Nassetta: Everything, you just said gives us the confidence that we're going to do. I think what why you're seeing what you're seeing is there with all due respect those are the products that are out there. There is no good mid-scale product that's why we are doing it. We've had such amaze. If you think about the history of it and I've said this certainly in one-on-one meetings and I think maybe on one of these calls, I mean Hampton was initially targeted to be in that segment. It has just been so successful that it's grown up out of it so it's in upscale. It's not a technically, I think this year will be close a $115 average rates in the system, and as a result there is a huge swap 40% of the demand base in the U.S. markets and similar sort of stats as you go around the world that we find we're not serving as much as we want to because they can't afford our - basically our lowest chain scale product. So we think there is a big customer base out there that wanted but to your point the reason there has not been a lot of development. I don't think the products just by development the reason that we are taking along to get this right is we are not just going out and saying just do our hands and look alike, we're creating this segment and what we're doing - and when we're doing it in a way that there's going to be unlike anything anybody has done, it's going to be a - all new build against product that's out there that is almost no new build to your point. That's going to be very appealing to the customer and importantly that is engineered both to build and operate in a very simplistic way to be able to drive returns like we've done with Hampton. There will be a lower investment but we are trying to drive a similar type of return. We've been working with our ownership groups, we're way down the path and we think we've cracked that code. So we think we're going to do something. The reason I think this will be thousands of hotels because the demand is there, that is the reason nobody is building there because there's no product that resonates with the customer and these types of products aren't delivering returns to owners. So they don't build them, they're building Hampton and Garden Inn and Core Garden and Fairfield or whatever. We think we're going to give them an alternative to serve a customer base. We're not serving and they might create returns and have a product that the customer loves, because they have such [indiscernible] now. So in terms of like fast forward down the road, we're not ignoring the high end of the business. By the way, we have amazing momentum in the luxury space of Conrad and Hilton and then doing amazing things with Curio and Canopy, we gave you some of the stats in terms of number of units and when you fast forward five years and 10 years and 15 years down the line. This can be a megabrand that generates mega EBITDA because this can be 1,000 - the smaller hotels but they're going to be thousands of them just as we've done in Hampton.
Thomas Allen: Thanks. And as my follow up, I think the first question you guys were asked about I think Harry highlighted that investors top concern is just around the cycle. I think investors second highest concern is just around the threat from the sharing economy, and I'm often and people were often accused of being two flipping around that threat. Can you kind of address that? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. Arabian B or [indiscernible] or anything above I guess.
Thomas Allen: Exactly.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. We - you can imagine that we've said around this table that the management team as of - with our board of directors talking about it and really - and we've talked with the Arabian B folks I mean and lots of other things in the industry. In the end, I won't [indiscernible] I view it as a different sort of customer, looking for a different type of experience. I think it's a real business for sure, a growing business for sure that what it really is that its core is a leisure value adventure sort of need that it's fulfilling. That is not what we are. I mean we are at some leisure, yes, but we're not trying to be the cheapest. We're trying to be the highest quality product and service, so the people will pay a premium and we're not trying to provide an adventure in that sense, meaning we wanted to be very high quality product and service that you know exactly what you're getting. So, I think the proposition when customers - our customers are coming to us, what they're looking for is something different than what they're looking for when they go there. I'm not going to say there is zero overlap that none of our customers ever used them, but I think they use them for different needs, and I think largely as we look at it statistically, okay, in every market is a little different and we can talk about New York, whatever, but if you look at the broad business for those guys, I think it is growing the pie more than anything. I think it is stimulating more travel that wouldn't have occurred, and in the end I think that's a good thing. Getting people travelling more is fantastic. As we think once they're travelling and they get the bug, they're eventually going to come stay with us, because we're going to be able to satisfy a different kind of need that they're going to have, particularly as they sort of grow up and move up in their careers and family then all of those things, so what they're looking for may be a little bit different. So, I'm not saying, but I'm not trying to be [indiscernible] and say, we don't think about it, we don't care, we dismiss it, we think about it a lot. We talk about it a lot. But those anecdotally and with hard statistics, I think in the end they are not impacting. I do not think they have a material impact on us. I think they make our pie bigger and ultimately stimulating people to travel more and that I think a good thing.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering, I know within the context of your group pace for 2016. Kevin, I believe you said mid-single digits. Could you guys talk a little about that the tenure of maybe some of your group discussions over the several months and relative to - we have this conversation at the end of April. And, then maybe if could provide a little bit color on in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter trends?
Christopher Nassetta: See, I would say group tenure is the same. I mean, I don't think there is already material difference. I think we're looking at year, next year, that's going to be another very good year. We're looking at having a good position. So that means, we don't have as much capacity to available for people. So I think that - to kind of just to give us incrementally a bit, a bit more leverage. So I don't - I wouldn't say its moved a whole lot, either way. I mean, if anything, I think our leverage levels for a group of things have gotten little stronger, if I look at west, if I look at sort of the back that up even in the quarter, but certainly going forward, the majority of our group growth is coming through rates. So I think is, for us a good reflection if anything that we're - the leverage level we're getting is growing, not diminishing and it should be, the more we build out, the bigger we based, the more we selective, we can be and there is less sort of capacity for people to book. So we can drive higher rates. In the quarter, bookings were strong, I think they were Q2 forward looking up in the high single digits from our pace point of view. So quite good
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thanks Chris.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Loeb from Baird. Your line is open.
David Loeb: Good morning.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, David.
David Loeb: I want to come back to China for a minute. I wanted to ask about your agreement with Plateno, there have been some press accounts, it's just the Plateno and Jin Jiang are getting together, will that have any impact on your deal with them?
Christopher Nassetta: No. I mean we've been in a pretty constant dialogue with them as that has been evolving as you might imagine, and I think our view of a combination of Jin Jiang and Plateno is that together they are even stronger and an even better partner for us than what we're trying to do, and in discussions with them I don't think it changes their commitment to what we're trying to do at all.
David Loeb: Great. Thanks. You've covered all the other important stuff already, so. Thank you.
Christopher Nassetta: Okay. Thanks, David.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Hey. Hey, good morning, everyone. Are you seeing any...
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Wes Golladay: ...headwinds on that - are you seeing any headwinds on the cost side with developers in the U.S. particularly in the select service?
Christopher Nassetta: Well, I mean the answer is yes, but not in a way that's slowing down our ability to get our - add to our pipeline. There is no question that there is more construction going on and not just in hotels incrementally, obviously, a bit more on hotels, but across the board more infrastructure spending going on. You're starting to see construction in the other areas of real estate, home building is picking up. So there is no question, cost of build are going up at higher than the sort of average inflationary increases, but given the strength of the business in terms of the growth in RevPARs, I think it has generally been keeping up enough that the deals that really make sense that are getting done. That is a reason, by the way and I have articulated this before that I have such confidence in the supply side of it, which is that not all deals make sense. There is a reason that there is basically two companies that make up half a more than half of what's getting built in U.S. and those are the two companies [indiscernible] included that have very, very high market share that allow the economics to work, the [indiscernible] while the other stuff is being getting done is because cost to build are - have been going up and they're high, and if you don't have the high market shares, the economics don't work. So it's sort of a good new story for us, because we've got that market share, we can continue to build our pipeline when others can't - and the cost increases that are going on in construction which are not insignificant are keeping a bit [indiscernible] on overall supply, and I think we'll continue to do so. I don't think the U.S. economy get sort of season this recovery a little bit more, I think that will continue to be problematic.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Now switching over to China, how are the developers funding the projects over there. And can you give us a brief overview profile of the developers?
Christopher Nassetta: Well, the profile is changing, I'd say in the big full service and luxury stuff that is still a component of what's in our pipeline and getting done, and we're still signing some of those deals new, that those are very large companies that that are in a lot of different businesses and in many cases partially government owned or is it local or nationally in national government, and that sort of been the pattern and there is a spattering of publically listed Hong Kong based real estate companies in there, but a lot of those deals have been done by very big Chinese conglomerates that own lots of different, I mean lots of different industry potential and have some government ownership. What's shifting in that is as we're going to a more of a limited service make up because that's where the demand is as I already described, and where the money is flowing, it's changing not unlike in the United States where you're getting smaller players, entrepreneurial players much lesser the big conglomerates and much more diversified smaller entrepreneurial individuals, small companies, families that are making those kinds of investment that I think is a really good thing that's a natural thing, that's exactly you look at the [indiscernible] system in the U.S. as an example of this massively diversified and largely our owners are small families and small businesses. I think that is increasingly what you're going to find happening in China as you shift the business to more of a limit sort of business for us that create, I think a great diversified base of owners that lowers risk and also provide more avenues of growth.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot for taking the question.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Our next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. I think most of my questions have been answered, maybe just a circle back to one topic for little more clarification, which is a potential for spinning out of REIT. I mean, I think just maintaining the RevPAR guidance is kind of a victory, given the lower RevPAR guidance from the number of other [indiscernible] . So, its sounds like you're saying that kind of lower valuations out there wouldn't deter you interest in a REIT spent, but maybe it's fair to say it would change the potential timing of it?
Christopher Nassetta: Not necessarily, again, I think the lens, we're going to look at which is what I would have, all shareholders would want us to look there is, how do we create the best long-term value for everybody, and so, I think when you're doing that you'll be very careful in my mind to look at any sort of snapshot in time of what it was three months ago or yesterday what it might be a month from now. I think it is sort of, when you look at the different pieces of our businesses, it's a bunch of different filters that you're looking at its relative valuations, its tax efficiencies, its opportunities to activate in different ways various businesses, all against incremental cost of what might be more G&A that more than one enterprise as compared to what we are today, and I think all of those things are factors, not they're complicating too much and not to put tangle [indiscernible] . Those are the sort of factors that we are filtering through as we go through it, and obviously we're kind of seeing what's going on in the market, but we're trying to take a long view on where relative valuations, we think relative evaluations have been and will be.
Robin Farley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent: Hi, good morning.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Steven Kent: Two questions. First, just a better sense for cash used, you generally have been paying down around $200 million in debt every quarter, now you'll be paying around $70 million with the dividend. What will happen to the rest of the $130 million or so, if that kind of go towards debt, you mentioned buybacks, but is there some kind of pacing that you are thinking about or how do you think about that? And then separately that with the other adjustment line item and the adjusted EBITDA bridge, and I just wanted to understand what that is, and how we should be thinking about that other adjustment line over the next couple of quarters?
Kevin Jacobs: Sure, Steve, its Kevin. I think on dividend versus use of cash, I think our other uses of cash are going to stay very similar, we're not going to change our overall outlook on our capital allocation, and we do still, as I said in my prepared remarks want to achieve investment grade. And I think as we've said to you all along that we thought that target range for our balance sheet was between three times or four times leverage. I think we'll find that a little bit as we've gotten into it where we're targeting a range of 3 times to 3.5 times. And so, we think we're going to finish the year at 3.4 times with the dividend. So that gives us a little bit of room to go towards getting into sort of the middle of that range. So you would see the other use would be continued debt pay down in the back half of the year. And then on the other line item, it's pretty straightforward that the line share of that is severance related to the Waldorf story of transaction, which was effectively a transaction cost as part of the overall transaction where we're picking up 80% of the severance deal, and that's all baked into that line [indiscernible] .
Steven Kent: That as a line, will go back to our figure on $20 million or so per quarter?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Yes.
Steven Kent: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Crow from Raymond James. Your line is open.
Bill Crow: Hey, good morning.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning, Bill.
Bill Crow: Just to clarify, Kevin you had earlier suggested $800 million debt reduction for the year, you're now increasing that, I'm just trying to build that same bridge between the $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion of capital available to reduce debt and return to shareholders against $800 million debt reduction and $130 million, $140 million dividends?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. I think the difference Bill is the Sydney paydowns worth $800 million or so, $800 million or so I think was a prior number, I'm not [indiscernible] I'm not sure exactly what the number you're referring to, but I think it was our prior guidance number and then that moved up to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion when we sold Sidney and have the Sidney paydown in there, and so now all you would do is take the dividend amount and that would be part of the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Does that answer the question?
Bill Crow: Yeah. I guess so, I though your actual debt retirement paydown number was $800 million for this year, which was actually hit already, but you're increasing that number [indiscernible] , correct? Well, we increased it last quarter to our guidance went up to $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion last quarter when we reached agreement on Sidney.
Bill Crow: Okay. Of debt reduction, okay. Very good, Chris, couple of quick topics. Myriad signed a marketing and distribution agreement with TripAdvisor, I wanted to get your thoughts on that, any, you'll go reducing commissions paid out. And then the other topic, Chris is, as you think about this potential to divide up the company and knowing that you're kind of allergic to G&A would it not make sense to look for an existing REIT platform that already has the G&A commitment that might make the economics work better?
Christopher Nassetta: Okay. Happy to [indiscernible] on Trip, obviously I'm not going to get into where we might be with any particular party. We've had some discussion with them, those discussions are ongoing, unclear where they will end up. But we made you something with - that's the reason we would see because the terms of what we get term with them are consistent with basically three pillars that we have in dealing with any of our distribution partners, and that is 1) we want complete control of our inventory 2) we want to have the ability to price differentially to our most loyal customers or otherwise known as our honest members, and 3) we want to have very efficient margin structures or commission structures with them. And I'd say not a pillar, but sort of the overarching philosophy is always going to be that we want to have the most direct relationship we can have with our customer. So, everything we are doing that we talked about in the prepared comments about our HHonors app and straight-to-room, and all of what we are doing with CRMs is all around trying to shift as many people into our direct channels, because number one, we want to have that direct relationship, and two, it's the most cost efficient way for us to be able to distribute our product. It will always - obviously be - we will have distribution partners. I don't see a world where we're going to get everybody to come direct to our channels, the more the better, and when we're going to have distribution channel partners like potentially three or four or others that we are all aware. We are very, very focused on making sure it sort of meets the standards of our three pillars. Then what we do with trip, I don't know, if we can reach the standards of our three pillars, we may do something with them. On the spends, I don't want to - yes, there is theoretically a rational for - if you decide at some point, you wanted to separate the real state and yes, I do not like incremental GNA, that there would be ways to do it that would be more efficient to doing it ourselves, that when I say we will look at all options, we will look at that option as well.
Bill Crow: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Vince Ciepiel from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Vince Ciepiel: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have question on margins, they have been impressive in the quarter and year-to-date, when you look at RevPAR growth of your business it's equally been driven by occupancy and rate, so is there anything going on with costs there, and how should we think about margins progressing into the second half?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Vince this is Kevin. We certainly had something's go our way in terms of cost in the quarter. Energy being predominant costs that's been down due to what's going on in the oil markets, and we continue to work our labor management systems to run the properties as efficiently as we can, and so if we achieve RevPAR growth that is in excess of inflation, particularly as you point out of it, it comes more from rate than occupancy, we should be able to continue to drive margin growth.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks. And then, different topic, the last couple - actually last couple of years, Hampton, Doubletree and Garden Inn have led you guidance as RevPAR growth. I noticed they are more in line with the system average this quarter. So I guess first, how much of that's related to kind of the weather taxes impact you alluded to? And then second, you guys provided kind of a positive longer term outlook, just part of that those brands leading system [indiscernible] RevPAR growth going forward?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, I think, I think it is partially a result of those brands being more impacted by the things that impact the Q2 for sure. But as we've said in couple of calls ago, we do believe that RevPAR growth levels are going converge as between the lower segments and the upper segments, and I think, when we look at the balance of the year, and we look in the next year and frankly the year-to-date even sort of extracting out the weather impact, we believe that's happening. The upper end of the business is definitely catching up, which is I think a good thing. International thing is as the group base continues to build because the upper end is more driven by that Group base.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Joel Simkins: Yeah, good morning guys. I can't believe we've made it 67 minutes on the timeshare. But timeshare obviously has continued momentum for you can you just give us a little bit color on what you're seeing out there in this business, whether it relates to tour flow, package size, well I miss to use financing and then you are seeing some additional opportunities with this to continue to feed them own to retail inventory or something that tend one assets to this business?
Christopher Nassetta: We're - the timeshare but we didn't spend in time on time it's doing incredibly well they look at it again others that are reporting, I mean our tour flow numbers are way up in the quarter up 9%, VPG is up 7.5%. We expect those kinds of numbers plus or minus for the full year. So our timeshare business is hitting and also and there is and it's doing honestly in a very different way as we've talked about then all of our competitors in the sense that we've got the vast majority now over 80% of our inventory that is what we're doing that a very capitalized way, I think 60% roughly of our sales in the quarter were in the capitalized segment. So we have really, I think - I know I have really transformed this business over the last three or four years and we continue to build momentum, I know there's always a question like was it sustainable and can you keep building the inventory and I think we have proven our inventory numbers have been moving up even as the economy hits stronger, people thought well there won't be broken deals and we've proven just because of the returns we can deliver that we're able to find more and more counterparties that want to do this with us. So, we announced - I think Kevin comment a couple of deals, we did it quickly and gently. But we just did another in the quarter, another couple of capital light deal. So, Kevin may want to add to it. I think this business is cranking and sitting on all cylinders. Our team is doing an amazingly good job.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. I think as it relates to the consumer Joe, I mean the consumer confidence is up, right. And so, the time shares, it is at the end of the day, consumer products driven by how the consumer feels about their own outlook and their own balance sheet. And so, you are seeing [indiscernible] see high levels of sales growth, more people willing to go on tours. On the margin, we haven't really changed the financing profile of the business that much. But on the margin that consumer willing to borrow a little bit more to stretch with that project - product, because they feel good about their own balance sheet. And then the last thing, Joe, I didn't quite follow the question as it related back to the 1031, were you are asking if there are time share opportunities specifically at those assets?
Joel Simkins: Yeah. Those assets are - how you continue to think about parsing out a couple for [indiscernible] your own hotels to these types of projects particularly urban locations?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. I think we continue to think about those kinds of things that the 1031, there is - the urban hotel in San Francisco, who knows. But I think as Chris mentioned, we are - we're finding really good capital light deals to do. So, we look at those first, and then we always continue to look at opportunities for value enhancement in our properties including at the 1031. I'm not sure that there will be any major projects there, but we are certainly finding good ROI projects to do in that portfolio whether or not there will be in the time share state, I'm not sure. But we will create value in those...
Kevin Jacobs: In the owned segment including properties that we have owned for a period of time, there are two or three incremental opportunities over time to take pieces of existing hotels, something that we will more potentially at the New York Hilton and so, and we've talked a little bit about Hawaii in Waikoloa [ph] and there are one or two other urban markets where I think there is some opportunities that were moving down the path on and at the appropriate time we'll make sure we let you guys know about them.
Joel Simkins: That's very helpful. One quick follow-up if I may here. Chris, you call out some very interesting mobile, check-ins [indiscernible] , and I certainly recognize this isn't all about cost savings, but it sounds like you've had some pretty high adoption rates, clearly the consumer wants to control their experience, so in terms of that small base of the hotels you're deployed at currently, do you - are you seeing any real meaningful kind of front of the house, back of the house, how is efficiency opportunities?
Christopher Nassetta: Not yet, because it's too early in the process. I mean right now, we're not trying to drive cost and as you pointed out, eventually, I think it is there opportunities to drive costs down and/or repurpose people, but at the moment we're using - we're doing - we're using those people to sort of help retrain our customers. So not unlike, I feel like how the airlines did this and they went to online check in and kiosk [indiscernible] . In the beginning, there is a lot of work in training and human resource effort to get people to adopt, understand and make sure work. So, we're in that stage, but the adoption rates are huge, by the way I didn't noted, but the satisfaction rates are off the chart. Think about it, it's a real simple philosophy. You guys, everybody wants, what you want and I want. They want choice and control in the palm of their hand and they want to interact with us just like they're interacting with so many other businesses in every - their everyday life, and so, the hotel business honestly over time probably hasn't kept up with that. We're trying to not only keep up with it, but get ahead of it. I do think ultimately it's going to build increased loyalty and market share. It's going to create cross-sell opportunities and up-sell opportunities that I think are going to be meaningful and it's going to create cost efficiencies, okay. It's not incremental extra cost now I'd say sort of neutral but ultimately there will be cost efficiencies as we get broad adoption.
Joel Simkins: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Agnew from MKM Partners. Your line is open.
Christopher Agnew: Thanks very much. Good morning.
Christopher Nassetta: Good morning.
Christopher Agnew: Agree with your sentiments air BMB, but just wanted to follow up with the question. A) is the risk that the rapid growth of alternative accommodation is holding back pricing power, or even has the potential to hold back pricing power for the industry given that these types of accommodation can come into their own when there is compression. So how do you think about the risks that pricing power is maybe weaker than in previous cycles, or what it should be given favorable supply demand conditions in the industry? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah, not to be a poly I mean obviously any type of supply could have the effect of taking away our pricing power and there may be markets where there is some impact there. It's not an impact as we look at it enough that we can measure, and as I said, I think it's just a different kind of customer. So the largest part of our base of customers is really a business customer for a business purpose. And I know they're trying to get in that business and good luck and then and I'm sure they'll love the business, but I just don't think in terms of the core customer that we're serving and what that core customer is telling us that they want from us that they're enough similarities where they overlap is creating a really credible alternative that's effecting pricing power in a meaningful way as we study. Again, you can probably pick micro-markets and there'd be exceptions to but broadly we are not seeing. I don't expect to see it.
Christopher Agnew: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chad Beynon from Macquarie. Your line is open.
Chad Beynon: Great. Thank you very much. With respect to corporate negotiated rate budgeting and the timing of these conversations with your partners in the next couple of months, acknowledging that the majority of the leverage is in your favor as you spoken about how important is the timing of these conversations against a potential fed rate increase and how important is the size of that increase in these negotiations maybe some anecdotes over the past couple of cycles what you've seen during other periods when rates were increasing? Thanks.
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah, it's a good question, I'm going to ask to admit I haven't actually scientifically done the correlation that increases while we're in negotiations on corporate rate. So I can't give you an exact answer. Here is what I'd say that anecdotally, I do think we have more pricing power, so if we were in the sort of low to mid-single digits I would - this year, I would expect we'd be in the mid to higher single digits, just because we do have incrementally more pricing power while increasing rates could have an impact. The net results of increasing - the reason rates would be going up to begin whether the economy is stronger. If they're going up faster than people expect it just means ultimately the economy is stronger than everybody expects. The economy being stronger is advantageous to us meaning kind of we being stronger is creating more demand for room nights there is the same amount of capacity essentially because there is very limited new set capacity coming on. It should incrementally give us more pricing power. So not that I want to rates to go up fast, don't get me wrong, but if rates started to go a lot better faster clip, I think it’s reflective of our business [indiscernible] ultimately we are, we re-price every day and ultimately reflective of our business being very, very strong, and I think gives us more leverage in the negotiation.
Chad Beynon: Okay. Thanks. And can you provide us with the percentage of your managed properties that paid IMS during the quarter versus last year?
Christopher Nassetta: Yeah. I think it was in the low 50s versus - that - it was in the low 60s this year versus low 50s last year.
Chad Beynon: Okay. Thank you very much.
Christopher Nassetta: You bet.
Christopher Nassetta: Okay. Is that - I guess we're done by questions. So thanks everybody for joining the call, we'll, I don't know where our operator is, maybe she disappeared, but we appreciate this time today, obviously pleased with the quarter, very excited about the way we think the second half of the year is going play out. Looking forward to getting back with you after our third quarter end. Take care. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Sally, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hilton Worldwide First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Charnaux.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Sally. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide first quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. For discussion of some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures on this call. You can find reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures discussed in today’s call in our press release and SEC filings which have been provided on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our first results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report a great start to the year with strong first quarter results driven by topline RevPAR growth near the high-end of our guidance and strong fee growth and ownership segment performance, all of that resulted in adjusted EBIT -- EBITDA exceeding our guidance. We continue to feel great about the fundamentals in our set up going forward in rate and have raised our guidance for the full year. We grew system-wide comp RevPAR of 6.6% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter, exceeding comparable RevPAR growth in Q1 2014 by 1.2 percentage points. With the added impact of weather in the quarter of about 0.5 point worse than last year, underlying RevPAR performance this quarter was clearly stronger year-over-year. Rate growth accounted for little more than half of system-wide RevPAR growth, while occupancy continues to show strength up 210 basis points to 71% in the first quarter. Positive demand trends in both the group and transient segments along with revenue management strategy targeting shoulder periods should continue to drive ongoing occupancy growth. System-wide group revenue -- group room revenue rose 6.8% in the first quarter, supported by strong demand especially from small rooms and company meetings, performance was modestly ahead of system-wide transient growth of 6.3%, which benefited from strong U.S. corporate negotiated and rack rated business, increasing by 9% and nearly 10%, respectively. In Group, we are seeing strong growth at the top end of the demand funnel with perspective Group business up significantly in the quarter year-over-year. We expect Group business strength will continue, particularly in the seasonally stronger second quarter, which is also showing solid growth. Group position continued to track up in the mid-single digits for the full year. F&B revenue at system-wide owned and managed hotels grew in the mid-single digits in the quarter, great banquet and catering business, especially in the Americas and Europe coupled with robust outlet performance, particularly in Japan drove the majority of the gains. As discussed last quarter, we are extremely pleased with the successful execution of the Waldorf Astoria New York sale and 1031 exchange. To complete the exchange, we plan to deploy the last portion of the Waldorf sale proceeds to acquire what is currently the Cypress Hotel in Cupertino, California for $112 million. We expect to close on the transaction sometime in the second quarter. To recap, we sold the Waldorf at a multiple of 32 times adjusted EBITDA, retained 100-year management contract, obtained a commitment from the buyer to renovate the property and use the net proceeds to acquire high-quality assets and some of the fastest-growing and highest barrier to entry domestic market at an aggregate multiple of just over 13 times adjusted EBITDA, more than doubling the adjusted EBITDA contribution to the company. Also in the real estate area this morning, we announced the sale of the Hilton Sydney, capitalizing on favorable market conditions to sell asset at attractive pricing in a tax efficient manner. The 442 million Aussie dollar sale price represents approximately 15 times adjusted EBITDA multiple and its subject to a 50-year management agreement. Upon closing, we expect to use the proceeds of the sale, net of transaction costs to further deleverage the company through an incremental debt prepayment. On the development front we continue to see tremendous momentum. During the first quarter we opened 53 hotels with more than 8,000 rooms. We approved more than 23,000 rooms globally, totaling our highest number of deals in the quarter this cycle. Our 240,000 room pipeline is the largest in the business, according to Smith Travel and including all approved deals our pipeline stands at nearly 255,000 rooms. According to Smith Travel, we also maintain the largest share of rooms under construction globally, with nearly 20% -- with nearly a 20% share, representing more than 126,000 rooms. We are thrilled with the continued success of our newest brands, Curio a collection by Hilton has been a homerun for us with nearly 40 properties and 11,000 rooms open or in various stages of development. We continue expanding into new urban and resort markets, and we are very excited by the brands international debut with several deals across Europe, including Istanbul, Hamburg, and the historic Astor Hotel in Paris. We also signed agreements to add two Curio properties in Jamaica, which are slated to join the collection later this year and will mark the brands debut in the Caribbean. We also continue to see tremendous interest from owners in Canopy, our accessible lifestyle brand. Canopy has a total of 15 hotels either in the pipeline or with signed letters of intent. Curio and Canopy are off to a great start and we continue to have great success in growing all of the brands in our portfolio. Recently our Hampton and flagship Hilton brands each passed the 200,000 room milestone with another combined 100,000 rooms in the pipeline. DoubleTree by Hilton recently reached the 100,000 room milestone with another 40,000 rooms in the pipeline. Additionally, just last week, we announced the first Hilton Garden Inn will open in Hawaii early next year, bringing the powerhouse brand to all 50 states and increasing its distribution to nearly 100,000 rooms globally. Now let me update you on our outlook around the world for the remainder of the year. Overall, the fundamentals of the cycle remained strong. In the U.S. where we generate nearly 80% of our adjusted EBITDA, we maintain our mid to high single-digit RevPAR growth forecast for the full year 2015, continuing demand growth driven by an improving economy, combined with historically low supply growth should continue to delivering solid fundamentals. New York is the notable exception where strong demand is being tempered by supply growth many times greater than the U.S. average. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we anticipate mid single-digit RevPAr for the full year with positive momentum in Mexico, somewhat muted by weaker trends in Argentina and Brazil. We maintained our mid single-digit RevPAR growth expectation for Europe, expecting mixed performance across the region, positive trends should continue throughout Germany, while Southern Europe should benefit from accelerating leisure demand. This will be tempered by anticipated economic and geopolitical challenges weighing on result in France and Eastern Europe, respectively. For the Middle East, Africa region, we forecast mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the year, while improvements in Egypt appears sustainable, softening demand from Russia continues to be an overhang on fundamentals in the Arabian Peninsula. In Asia-Pacific, we continue to expect high single-digit RevPAR supported by robust demand in Japan, recovery in Thailand and positive momentum in Shanghai and Beijing. The strength of these trends should more than offset modest weakness in Hong Kong and softening business transient demand in Singapore. We continue to forecast 6% to 8% RevPAR growth in China for the year, given our significant market share gains and market mix. In closing we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and remained optimistic regarding fundamentals for the balance of the year and the foreseeable future. I believe that with our company’s unique attributes we are in excellent position to continue outperforming in a very favorable environment. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Kevin, who will give you greater detail on our results and the outlook for the year rest of the year.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, our RevPAR growth of 6.6% was driven by 3.5% increase in average rate and a 2.1 percentage point increase in occupancy. In actual dollars system-wide RevPAR increased 4.6%. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.15, an increase of 25% versus the prior year period. After adjusting for special items EPS was $0.12, which was at the high end of our guidance. We exceeded our guidance for adjusted EBITDA by approximately $25 million, driven by topline and fee growth, as well as ownership segment performance. We attribute roughly $15 million of the beat to favorable timing that will normalize over the balance of the year. Management and franchise fees were $391 million in the quarter, up 18% over the first quarter of 2014, driven by strong topline growth, new unit growth and a rising effective franchise rate, which increased 10 basis points to 4.7% versus the year ago period. Additionally, incentive fees rose 16% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter. For the full year, we expect incentive fee growth in the high-teens adjusting for currency and some one-time items. The ownership segment outperformed our expectations in the quarter, with particular strength in Chicago, San Francisco and Orlando driving great topline growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $190 million, up approximately 9% versus the prior year, given better than expected group performance coupled with operating margin expansion of 130 basis points as lower cost boosted flow through. Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA was $74 million in the quarter, a 10% decline versus the prior year period. Results met our expectations, given the accelerated timing of sales booked in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by higher fee for service sales and improved sales efficiency. We continue to expect timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $335 million to $350 million for the full-year. We continue to make progress on transitioning our timeshare business to a capital light business with 78% of intervals sold during the quarter developed by third parties. We remain extremely pleased with the success of our fee for service deals, particularly the Grand Islander, which brought its four-month sales total to over $160 million, making it our best launch by a significant margin. Our current supply of timeshare includes approximately 128,000 intervals, or over five years of inventory at the current sales pace, over 80% of which is capital light. We continue to expand our overall supply through capital light yields and are in discussions regarding several new capital efficient projects, which we expect to announce in the coming months. Finally, our corporate and other segment was $56 million for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Moving on to regional results, strong performance across the globe contributed to our success this quarter. U.S. RevPAR grew 6.5% versus the prior year period, driven by strong group businesses in our owned hotels and gateway cities, particularly Chicago and San Francisco. Overall performance was somewhat tempered, however, by severe weather which we estimate negatively affected RevPAR growth by 50 basis points in January and 300 basis points in February. Overall for the quarter, weather negatively affected U.S. RevPAR growth by about a point. In the Americas outside the U.S., RevPAR grew 6.7% for the quarter as strong results in Mexico more than offset challenges in Buenos Aires and São Paulo. In Europe, RevPAR increased 5.5% despite the first quarter being seasonally slow for the region. Performance benefited from strong citywide business across Germany in group business in markets like Prague, Copenhagen and throughout Ireland. These positive trends offset weakness in France. London had a difficult start to the year as well with lower in group -- lower-than-expected group business and soft transient demand. The Middle East and Africa region posted RevPAR gains of 5.4% for the quarter, driven primarily by double-digit growth in group business. Gains were predominantly owing to great convention calendars in Dubai, Doha, and Mecca. Additionally, the region continues to get a boost from improvements in Egypt which are offsetting softness in the Arabian Peninsula as that area struggles with a reduction in Russian demand. Finally, in our Asia Pacific region, RevPAR improved 10% year-over-year, driven by double-digit occupancy increases in Japan and Thailand and a RevPAR gain of 12% in China. We attribute outperformance in China to our exposure to faster growing markets, newer hotels ramping up and strong market share gains. Turning to our balance sheet, as of March 31st, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $816 million, of which $216 million is restricted. During the quarter, we reduced long-term debt by $225 million, including $150 million voluntary prepayment on our term loan and $75 million in debt reduction from the Waldorf sale and 1031 exchange. We ended the quarter at 3.9 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA and we prepaid an additional $100 million on our term loan this month, bringing total debt reduction year-to-date to $325 million. After completing the Hilton Sydney sale, we expect to prepay approximately $325 million of our term loan with the net proceeds and for the full year cash available for debt prepayments or capital return to stockholders should range from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Given our progress year-to-date, we remain well on our way to achieving our target leverage goals during the second half of the year. At that point, we intend to begin returning capital to stockholders, starting with the introduction of a dividend. We intend to outline more specifics during our second quarter earnings call. Turning to guidance, as Chris mentioned, we had a strong start to the year, feel great about the fundamentals and as a result, have increased our full-year outlook. Our systemwide RevPAR guidance is between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We maintain ownership segment 2015 RevPAR growth guidance of 4% to 6% on a currency neutral basis. We forecasted adjusted EBITDA to range from $2.81 billion to $2.87 billion for 2015, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint. The announced Hilton Sydney sale would reduce this range by $10 million to $14 million on closing. As a reminder, our initial 2015 guidance had already assumed EBITDA contribution from the full deployment of proceeds from the Waldorf sale and 1031 exchange. We expect diluted EPS, adjusted for special items to be between $0.79 and $0.83 for the full year. We expect management and franchise fee growth of 11% to 13% and are maintaining our net unit growth forecast of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms, representing 6% to 7% room growth in our management and franchise segment for the year. We expect the corporate and other segment to be roughly flat for 2015. CapEx spending excluding timeshare inventory is forecast to remain approximately $350 million to $400 million, including about $265 million to $285 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. For the second quarter of 2015, we expect systemwide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a currency neutral basis, driving management and franchise fee growth of 11% to 13%. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $740 million and $760 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.21 to $0.23. Further detail on our first quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. In order to speak to as many of you as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, could we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James & Associates. Your line is open.
Bill Crow: Good morning, guys. Nice start to 2015.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Bill.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks.
Bill Crow: Chris, as of 6:59 this morning, I wanted to ask your opinion of something that occurred on the Pebblebrook call when Jon Bortz last week suggested that RevPAR growth could accelerate in the U.S. next year relative to 2015 levels. But now as of 7 o’clock and with one of your peer's announcements, I've got to ask you about M&A and your thoughts about sector M&A, Hilton's potential appetite for participating in M&A, just kind of a broad, open-ended question here. Let me hear your thoughts on that?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Based on what I read in the press this morning, I figured somebody would ask me. Bill, thank you for being the one to do it and being first. For obvious reasons, I’m not going to come on anything specifically that we might or might not be doing. But in terms of broader thoughts on industry consolidation and our participation and I’m happy to talk about it. And I think you will find it is very consistent with everything I’ve said a thousand times over the last couple of years. In terms of broader industry consolidation, I think when you get to this stage of the cycle, you typically see more of it generally. And so I've every expectation that over the next 12, 24 months, you’re going to see more of it. And it will follow a typical pattern exactly who does what is impossible to know. We all have views. I have views of who could do, could do -- be part of consolidating on and on what side but time will tell. But I do think, you'll see an uptick and what exactly our competitor that made that announcement this morning does is really hard to know. I thought it was interesting, honestly, not particularly surprising when I read it. In terms of how we might participate in it, I think again consistent with what I’ve said, the way I look at the world is we’re in a really good place. You could see our first quarter results are really good in every regard. In my opinion, topline margins, bottom line, new unit growth, our expectations for the year are quite strong. We had a great year last year. We think we have everything we need to lead the industry in our regards, topline, bottomline and unit growth. And I think we’re doing a pretty good job of proving that in terms of the results that we’re delivering since we’ve been public. And our objective obviously is to continue to do it and I think we will. I think we have amazing opportunities with the brands that we have in our portfolio today and the opportunities we have to add to that portfolio brands to drive industry-leading organic net unit growth, which in my opinion is the best way to drive the highest value for all of our shareholders going forward. Having said that and consistent with everything I've ever said as a CEO, it would be silly to say we would never participate in M&A activity because you never know what opportunities might present themselves that could make a tremendous amount of sense. And so I think we always want to remain open-minded. We think we have everything we need to deliver -- to continue to deliver industry-leading results. But if there are opportunities over time that presented themselves that made it through the following two filters, we would have to be thoughtful about it and those two filters are the obvious ones. One, that whatever it is, is a thoughtful strategic fit in terms of, the meshing of whatever it might be with what we have and that the economic drivers are such that you could see significant value accretion as a result of whatever it might be. And so if there are things that present themselves that they get to those big filters then obviously we’re going to be thoughtful about it. There is a lot of complexity to any of those things that might happen over time but we would be thoughtful. But our primary job was I think were proving out is to grind it out and really drive industry-leading results with what we have. And I think we have a -- we have an amazing set up between the scale of what we have, the breadth and diversity of our geography, the breadth and diversity of our brands in terms of chain scale that give us a really unique advantage to be able to continue to grow at an accelerating pace.
Bill Crow: That's very helpful, Chris. Would you care to opine on the prospect or potential of a reversal in the second derivate of RevPAR growth in the U.S. industrywide because of better group bookings and better performance at a couple of big markets that are laggards this year. Is that something…?
Chris Nassetta: I said it in my prepared comments and we are being thoughtful about making sure we give time for other questions. I think we feel good about what’s going on in RevPAR growth. I think the best way to look at RevPAR growth is quarter-to-quarter or one year versus the next, verses last quarter because every quarter as you know in our business cycles through different group patterns and other things. When I look at it, I made the comment in my prepared comments for a reason because I’m trying to make the point that what we're seeing is acceleration. On a comp basis, our first quarter this year picked up over our first quarter of last year, not insignificantly, particularly when factoring for somewhat worse weather patterns in ’15 and ’14. So, all I’m going to say is from a cycle point of view, I think the fundamentals are as good as I've ever seen them. I know that everybody wants to debate it and I think that's fair because that is a really important point to understand. But from where I sit, having being doing this for 30 years in lots and lots of cycle, it's hard not to feel exceptionally good about what's going on in the sense that transient business is good and continues to stay good, if not get a little bit better. Group is rebounding exactly the way that we would think with the ancillary spend coming along with it, the patterns looking forward, feel very good. And supply is still at historically low levels and everything that you see going into the next two or three years suggests it’s going to be significantly below 30-year averages. So, I'm going to just say, we feel really good about where we are in the cycle. We feel really good about RevPAR growth and where it is and where it is going.
Bill Crow: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Hey. Good morning everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: Maybe just to stick with what is undoubtedly going to be the theme of the day. On M&A, Chris, could you just give us maybe a little bit more detail on kind of the opportunities in your own portfolio? Obviously, you're doing a ton on organic growth and particularly internationally as it relates to, I think, different brand profiles. So the question is, is there any area and particularly when we look at Hilton, I think we always kind of come back to the luxury component of the chain scale. Is there any area that you think you really could benefit from materially in terms of distribution power when you think about M&A? And how would you answer that or think about that?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I would answer it probably the same way I already answered it when Bill asked it. But let me add a little bit, kidding aside. Let me add a little bit more color. As I look at our opportunity for organic growth, I think it is a combination of layering our existing brands intelligently around the world. This is one of the benefits of having the chain scale diversity that we do, is that if we are really intelligent and I have said this many times that we can lean in and lean out around the world as market conditions change around the world and allow ourselves to grow following the demand patterns in the various regions of the world. So what we are doing in China, I think is a wonderful example. What we are doing in Europe is wonderful example of that. What we are doing in U.S. is a wonderful example of that, where you think about it. All of those are somewhat different stories. We have the chain scale diversity. We've been thoughtful about how we adapt our products and the service delivery for the particular regions and it’s allowed us to grow even when some of our competitors are not or they are growing at a much slower pace. And I think our objective and strategy is to continue to do that. So anticipating what might happen in China as we've done with the limited service business, same thing in Europe and we will continue to do that. So it is always from an organic growth point of view, in terms of numbers of rooms and hotels, the most significant opportunity is taking what we already have and deploying it really strategically and intelligently around the world. And we think that is a massive opportunity for growth. In addition, there are opportunities to -- we added two brands last year, which I talked about in my comments. We have some other opportunities and I have talked about those probably. I think, particularly an entry-level brand that would replace what space Hampton with all of its amazing success has exited as it’s moved up. And I think we could stand to have a slightly lower price point brand in the mid-scale segment and price point, that would allow us to capture customers earlier in their lifecycle and garner their loyalty to allow them to grow up and grow up with us in our system and shop in and around our system with our other brands. So, we are very hard at work, whether it’s this year or early next, sometime I’d say in the next 12 months. For sure, you are going to see us do something in that category. And we think that could be a mass scale brand globally. I mean, it will start likely in the U.S. But given the scale of the Hampton brand as an example, we have 2,000 hotels, over 2,000 hotels open. This could be amongst the largest brands by hotel count that we have. And I think we will be a very powerful driver of bringing new customers in and continuing to build loyalty. On luxury, specifically, I think we have made amazing progress from where we were six or seven years ago with Waldorf and Conrad. We have tremendous momentum going from a system that at that time was 20 hotels. So what’s opening the pipeline today is 80-ish hotels with some of the best hotels that are opening in the fastest-growing luxury brands in the world. I think we have great momentum in that space. And I think organically, we can accomplish our objectives in luxury space in addition to every other segment, I think that is represented in the industry. So, I feel like as I said sort of answering those questions, we have what we need to be successful. I do not -- I will be very clear. I do not think we have a strategic gap that we cannot deal with ourselves, okay. I don't feel like -- there's nothing we can’t accomplish organically. So there are others out there that we compete with, that might not be in that same position. But I think we have everything it takes to be successful. So, I will stop. That doesn’t mean that we are perfect. Okay. That doesn't mean that there aren’t things that we could do in luxury or frankly in any of our segments that can make us stronger and better. And I go back to what I said before. Whether it's luxury, whether it upscale, mid-scale, upper upscale scale, whatever we would do, whatever brand or whatever portfolio brands that might be out there and play, we are going to at it through the lens as I described. Does it fit strategically and make us better than where we are? Does it allow us to ultimately accelerate our growth over time? And ultimately as a result of that and other factors, could we create significant value? Because we all know, whatever it is big or small, there are always risks in doing things that are inorganic versus organic. So those are the filters that we would look through and I know everybody is looking for more [indiscernible], I’d say, we are in a nice position where we don't have to do anything. I think we can be very, very successful and create a huge amount of value doing this, doing what we do organically. But we always are going to be thoughtful about broader opportunities.
Shaun Kelley: Thanks for beating the dead horse for me. I appreciate it.
Chris Nassetta: You are welcome. I suspect that may not be the last time I beat the horse, so I will get my whip out.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, you've always been pretty forthright with your view of the cycle and maybe the cadence of the cycle, more specifically as it pertains to an elongated, stable mid single-digit RevPAR growth. When you think about in the context of your peers and thinking about it along the lines of clearly differing views of the cycle sometimes lead to a little bit more activity in the space. As you speak to some of your peers to the extent that you do, are you starting to hear more differentiated opinions as to where we are or how this cycle will proceed from here?
Chris Nassetta: That’s an interesting question. I mean, you could probably answer it better than I could in the sense that while I talk to my peers, my guess is you are talking more directly about this topic than I am to my peers. But Carlo, interesting and good question. I’d say so no. I do not -- I can't think of a conversation, I mean, they always decrease but I'd say that there is not really anybody that I'm talking to that’s in the industry that is viewing the cycle a whole heck of a lot differently than what I described. I know that I’ve kidded people about this. Everybody wants to do it, particularly when it’s baseball season and what inning are you in and people might have different views within an inning that I've sort of gotten out of the business of talking about what inning we are in because I don't think it matters. I think what matters is what's in front of us, not what's behind us. And I in my prior response gave my views of that, which is I think what's in front of us is for as long as I think you could sort of try and be intelligent about it, which is the next two or three years, I think you’ve got an amazing set up. There are certainly things that could disrupt it. There are things that happened in the world that could cause reductions and demand and the like. But I’m saying all things being equal in the environment we are in from a macro point of view matched with what's going on the supply side. It is really hard for me and I think others that certainly I'm talking to, to have a view that’s different than that. I mean, they are just -- it is hard as I look. There is nothing in our business. There's no pattern. There is no metric. There's nothing that suggest there's a problem. That's very rare. I've heard those words come out of my mouth. I think I've been a real straight shooter for the time I’ve been in the industry. But it is good and until something really major changes, which I don't see on the horizons for what I can see, it’s going to stay good.
Carlo Santarelli: That’s very helpful. And if I could just ask one quick follow-up. I believe on the last call you guys had referenced management franchise RevPAR growth 5% to 7%, less 100 basis points for FX. Has that assumption changed at all? I assume based on the guidance, there is a little bit more built in for FX, but could you clarify from the RevPAR perspective?
Chris Nassetta: I will have Kevin to do that.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Carl, I think we still give the same range. I mean, I think if you do the math, it's a little bit worse because the outlook is getting a little bit worse, but I would still probably give the same range plus or minus for the differential.
Carlo Santarelli: Kevin, just to clarify, the outlook you're referring to the FX outlook, correct?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes.
Carlo Santarelli: Okay. Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent: Hi, good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Steve.
Steven Kent: Good morning. Can you talk about the competition for newly launched brands, Curio, Canopy, following similar brand launches from Hyatt, Starwood Marriott, etcetera. Are you finding that you need key money debt financing or more attractive terms to get people to sign with Curio? And then as a follow-on, and I am not sure if these two are linked. We noted that conversions were 40% of room additions in first quarter of 2015. How does that compare to history? What are franchisees typically converting from? And are they converting to some of these softer brands, Curio in particular?
Chris Nassetta: All right. There is a lot in that. So I'd say in short form, obviously there are competitive brands being launched. You guys are aware of them, reading about them. And thus, the question, I gave some of the stats in my prepared comments. It’s a competitive world, but I'd say we are faring very well. If you look at what's going on with Curio, five open, 11 in the pipeline, 23 under letter of intent, we have over 11,000 rooms already sort of teed up and ready to go. And I'm not saying that we don't have some competition occasionally, but we don't have I would say really stiff competition on the specific deals that we’re working on. We are not seeing any sort of pattern of having to buy the business in the form of key money or other things. And I think, Steve, I mean, it’ self-serving to say, but it happens to be in my humble opinion true. We have a unique competitive advantage. We have the Hyatt’s average market share in our -- of any of the players with our system producing an average market share of over 115%. If you look at Curio, you look at any new brand launch, what owners are trying to do is make a decision to put their money with whoever they think is going to drive the best economic result with the highest average market share and with the great scale and diversification geographically and chain skills that creates this loyalty effect which I talked a lot about, which is what’s helping drive that market share. I think owners are looking at that saying I want to be part of that because it’s going to help me drive more revenue and profitability into my hotel. So I think you can play with key money, you can invest. But when you have that advantage which we are not just planning to maintain but enhance in terms of growing market share, it gives you a unique competitive advantage in my opinion. Thus, I think the success that we are seeing in Curio and Canopy and I can assure you with the new brand that I mentioned that we are working on launching, we have tons and tons of interest from our existing particularly because that will be almost entirely a franchise brand from your existing franchise ownership community. For the very same reasons these are the same people that have built tons and tons of Hampton Inns that has an average market share of a 124%, 125% and they know we have the skills to replicate that in a system to drive the results. So I think there is something different about us in my humble opinion, which is the system is unbelievably powerful which allows us to get these brands up and running faster and deliver better commercial results for owners get better economic turns for us and do it with little or no capital. Okay. That’s our story. That’s our strategy. It’s as simple as that. In terms of conversions, we have great conversion activity in the first quarter, probably little higher than the full year. If you look at the last, I would say three years on average, it’s been about a third of our growth bounces up and down a little bit. It’s a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. I think for the full year it’s probably about a third. That’s what we see and it will, if you look at where it’s coming from, I mean the brands, it’s largely DoubleTree and Curio. That’s where we will see the conversion activity. Curio obviously was part of that strategy. DoubleTree, many years ago, six years ago as we rein -- sort of reenvision DoubleTree and transform that it was all about being a great conversion brand and we’ve had amazing success, far more conversions and far more rooms converted than any other of our competitors. And it’s coming from a host of places. If we look at DoubleTree, it’s coming from some of our competitor brands, a little bit of independent. If you look at Curio, a little bit of competitor brands but largely coming from independent hotels.
Steven Kent: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis: Good morning, guys. I think the horse has just a little bit more life in it.
Chris Nassetta: Oh, my god, really, okay.
Harry Curtis: No, it’s still…
Chris Nassetta: Let me get -- I will get the whip out.
Harry Curtis: It’s still switching. Two quick questions. First of all, do you think it's reasonable to believe that you've looked at most potential combinations, not just in the last six months, but over the last four years? And then the second question, and this is one that might be more politically different -- difficult to answer, but is it necessarily the case that Blackstone can do something separate from Hilton if they wish?
Chris Nassetta: On the first one, I am not going to comment and what we’ve looked at and what we haven’t looked at. I mean I think the broader thing Harry ,you can assume that we are living, breathing, sensing human beings that sort of are aware what’s going on in the market. And as a result, if nothing else, our intellectual curiosity takes us all over the place. So yes, we have been doing this long time. We are always noodling everything as we would hope we would. It doesn’t mean we do everything obviously. We are very thoughtful on that. But we are always sort of noodling about everything. In terms of BX, I think you need to ask BX. BX is a separate entity. They happen to own at the moment the majority of the company. But what they do with their independent separate funds that are is really their business.
Harry Curtis: Okay. Let me then, in my second question, move on to fundamental one. As you speak with your corporate customers, what are they indicating about their hotel needs over the next 12 months, given the relatively flat corporate profits in the first quarter? Is there any indication that they are likely to cut their travel budgets over the next 12 months?
Chris Nassetta: Really good question and interesting. And I think the answer is both sort of broadly talking are sales teams but also more specifically because I am constantly talking to some of our larger customers in various settings. I don’t know, not only do I not get a sense of them cutting back, I get a sense of them increasing volumes and being more willing to pay higher rates and knowing in a sense that they have to pay higher rates given what’s going on both in the broader economy as well as in the industry.
Harry Curtis: That’s perfect. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: You bet.
Vince Ciepiel: Wanted to focus a little bit on the stronger U.S. dollar and the potential impact on international stays, have you guys seen anything year-to-date? And are you seeing anything kind of impact bookings for this summer?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Another great question. It’s interesting when we look at all the data, intellectually given the strength of the dollar you have to believe that it’s impacting business at least somewhat. As we in the beginning of the year talked to our GMs in the big markets, they were not really indicating any material shift other than maybe in New York where you have a little bit heavier component where I think they were filling it a little bit. So anecdotally, I would say people didn’t think there is much. When you get the hard data at the end of the quarter which we now have, actually ironically international business was up in the quarter by a little less -- by better half a point. So not meaningfully but it was up. So what’s really been going on, New York down, but across the U.S. recognizing for background that it’s only 5% of our business across the U.S. to begin with, but that the world is a big place, I don’t have to tell you and there places where it’s more impacted than other places. So what we saw in the first quarter and I expect to continue is that business out of Europe, a little out of Canada, but mostly out of Europe was declining particularly at a Germany and France. Ironically don’t know exactly why to be honest, Spain was up. But what was up in a meaningful way was China, because a number of us that worked really hard in the industry to work with the U.S. government and the Chinese government to make it easier and more efficient to get visas and that is having a dramatic positive impact on what has been the largest outbound customer base, which is now China in the world. So those are sort of offsetting. I think as we get into the summer months, I think you get another dynamic which is I do believe with the strengthening dollar, you will continue to see some impact of European business coming in U.S., meaning it will be weaker. I think China business is going to continue to be strong. I think U.S. business in the US for the drive-through market given cheap gas prices is going to be better. And I think Europe is a bit on sale not an insignificant 9% or 10% of our business, I do believe and we are starting to see the early patterns of summer bookings. They are reflective of the fact that a lot of people are going to go to the Europe that might not have otherwise gone and that’s going to give us a boost there. The net result of all that is we are not -- we did not change our view on RevPAR growth and the simple reason is we don’t we think that with all the puts and takes they sort of flush out.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks. And then currency has moved against you guys a bit since the 4Q call. I think last time you noted on the $40 million full year headwind, of which about $25 million hits the fee business. Any updated thoughts there? And then I guess when you think about the EBITDA raise despite the FX, is it fair to say you're feeling a bit better about core fee growth out of that change?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Vince, it’s Kevin. That’s exactly the way to think about it so far. If our fee was $25 million and we set about $15 million of it, it was timing so we had $10 million beat in the first quarter and we raised $10 million for the year. We’ve got about $15 million to $20 million of incremental FX for the year, so it’s really a $25 to $30 million FX adjusted raise at the mid-point.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks for the explanation.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi. Thanks for taking the question.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks.
Felicia Hendrix: Kevin, I thought you -- maybe thought you were going to get off the hook on this call, but you're not. So, look, this is, obviously, the closest you guys are discussing a dividend. You said you're going to give us more color on the second quarter, just wondering that that even...
Kevin Jacobs: I did.
Felicia Hendrix: Yes. You did. Its going to be a second quarter announcement, are you going to discuss it further than? And then just wanted to know in light of that if you could discuss, your commitments in investment grade rating and timing on that?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Felicia. Yeah. We did say, we’ll give you, we’ll -- I think what we’ll do is outline a plan on the second quarter call. We’ve got to spend a little bit of time talking to our Board about what we want our strategy to be and looking at our forecast and obviously, ultimately, they’re the ones that will decide, but we will intend to be able the outline the plan on the second quarter call. The Sydney transaction incrementally helps get us a little bit closer and we've been saying, I think, for awhile now that we thought we'd be in the zone in the back half of year. We have not wavered on our commitment to investment grade. We think that the range that we've outlined would get us consistent with our peers. Our peers’ investment grade companies we will be balanced about it and work with the agency, so we've not wavered on that commitment.
Felicia Hendrix: Great. And then just also follow-up for you, Kevin. You mentioned in your prepared remarks increase in your effective franchise rate in the quarter.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah.
Felicia Hendrix: I was just wondering how much those rates can move up over the next few years and how much that could add in fees?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. I think, they ought to move up consistently with the way they have been. So it's been kind of around to 10 basis points for the quarter. It’s gone from four-flat to four-seven over the course of the last five years or so. And we would think that we could consistently, not only continue to get closer to our published rate, which is 5, 4.55 but if we do our jobs right and continue to grow -- strengthen the brands, we ought to be able to increase our published rates overtime. And so I think you'll continue to see it grow at the same -- at a similar pace.
Felicia Hendrix: Great. Thank you.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Sure.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.
David Loeb: Don’t worry, Chris. I'm not going there.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you. I’ve nothing more I can say on it, but I can try in other way to say. Go ahead. Sorry, David.
David Loeb: It’s okay. I just at the risk of asking what have you done for me lately question. You've made a lot of progress on asset monetization this year, clearly. But can you talk a little bit about what you're looking at in the future for additional monetization opportunities?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I -- we've been, I think, pretty consistent. I know very consistent on the point, which we had an opportunity in the Waldorf. We said that we may have others. Obviously, Sydney is one of those others. They maybe other asset sales I would say, that would be quite modest that we could pursue nothing around that corner. The bulk of the remaining real estate, certainly from of value point of view, David, really because of the tax attributes if and when we wanted to do something would really need to be done more on a structured transaction then kind of an asset monetization of the type we've been doing.
David Loeb: Okay. And then just to follow that, on the Cypress, what's the brand planning for that? What's your expectation -- what brand that hotel will become?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Ultimately it will become a Curio. Okay, we think is the appropriate branding.
David Loeb: Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Joseph Greff: Good morning all.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joseph Greff: Can you share with us your outlook for the New York City market for the balance of the year and if you think it's still a negative RevPAR growth market?
Chris Nassetta: You know, I don't. For the first quarter was obviously negative for us. The market was down in the 6s. Now that’s probably exacerbated by a lot of work going on at our largest hotel. We had a big renovation of rooms plus the retail space going on at the New York Hilton. So its comp, but -- its driving part of it, but it was down in the first quarter, as I think most sort of the industry stats are. For the full year, Joe, we think it's actually going to flip around. We don't think it's going to be leading the charge in terms of growth in U.S. But we’re in the low to mid-single digits, 3% to 5% growth is what we would forecast for the New York market overall. Early reads on April sort of feel pretty good, feels like after the first quarter with weather, with Super Bowl overlap with renovation disruption that we had all of those things sort of hurt the first quarter. When we’re get into April we look at the booking pace for May and June, supports what I'm saying. So, I think, we push really hard and dug really deep into these forecast and we’re pretty confident we’re going to show positive growth for the market.
Joseph Greff: Great. Thank you. And then, in your earlier remarks, Chris, you had mentioned in the first quarter the Group growth outpaced the transient growth. Do you see that perform more in balance -- the balance of the year, how do you see that transpire?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. I think they're balancing around the similar plate. They're both -- they thing about the last couple quarters, I don't have the numbers all on my head, but I think, this year we think they’re going to both be in the 6 to 7 range and one might be a little higher or lower, depending on the quarter, because as we all know Group sort of cycle differently in the quarters depending on the big groups in the big hotels. But we feel like it’s going to -- they’re both going to be in that range, which is why I sort to say, I’ve never felt -- I've never seen it feel better when you got sort of all the cylinders hitting at same time.
Joseph Greff: That's all for me. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you just about the mid-scale segment. Just a couple of questions, we continue to see pricing and those lower price points looks to be better gains year-over-year. And do you still kind of think that we'll see more convergence there? I think you had talked about that on the fourth quarter call, given the group trends that you're seeing. And also, I know supply remains pretty low, but we are seeing kind of -- it seems like a pretty rapid pickup in the number of upper mid-scale hotels in the pipeline. And when you talk to developers, do you see like kind of a market difference in the ability to access financing or lower equity needs or kind of how -- what are you sort of seeing in that area?
Chris Nassetta: No. I think -- maybe I’ll take the last first. I think the reason you're seeing the more of the development getting done there is that the economic model works there. I mean, so I think that the end market is sort of efficient. People are able to drive better results, higher margins and as a result can raise the capital to do it. So I don’t think it’s a problematic data but I think it's -- I mean, you stated the fact. You're seeing the highest RevPAR growth in that segment and supply is higher in that segment, not crazy high but of the segment it’s higher. I think its cause and effect. I mean, it’s just the economic model is driving that. We don't see that there is a mounting problem performance continues to be very good, even as supply is coming because it’s just healthier. There's more demand and the money is following that demand. In terms of convergence I do -- we saw a little bit of the convergence I talked about in the first quarter. If we look at the focused service versus everything else and we still think for the full year, both those broad categories are going to perform well. And we do think that they're going to continue to converge.
Smedes Rose: Thanks. Just on the Cypress Hotel that you're acquiring, does Hilton have to pay a termination fee to get out of that Kimpton contract, or is that something that the seller would pay?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. We -- as part of the deal we do, but it’s a very modest term fee.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Joel Simkins: Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys. I just wanted to touch on the timeshare real quickly. Obviously, your results continue to look very strong there. One of your big competitors, I would say, was a bit mixed yesterday. So kind of what's the secret to success there right now? Are you seeing anything different from the consumer in terms of willingness to buy more product to be a bit more aggressive with financing? And then just to follow up with that, I mean, how you can continue to think about timeshare, sort of, core to your business and the current platform?
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah. Joel, its Kevin. I’ll take the first part and then maybe Chris will jump in on the second part. I think the consumer demand for the product remains strong. I think, we've seen -- well, our results have been -- in fact, our VPG for the quarter was up over 20%, now that’s been partially driven by. We opened a really strong high-priced product at the Grand Islander in Hawaii, so that’s driving VPG. But for the full year, we still think it's going to be strong at 10 plus percent growth in VPG with high single-digit growth in tourist. So we continue to see high demand for the product but a lot of it's driven by great projects in strong markets and our ability to sell it well.
Chris Nassetta: On the second part of the question, it goes without saying, we’re very happy with the result in timeshare that Kevin just described. We’re very happy with the transformation in the progress we’re making towards making it a very high percentage of capital light business. Our customers love it. The results are good. We’re changing the return profile of the business to be much like the hotel business. So it's good on all fronts but I will say, very simplistically as you would hope, we’re always looking at ways to maximize the long-term value of the company. As part of that we’re looking at all the options on all segments of the business, including timeshare and trying to be thoughtful about not withstanding how successful it is. Is there another format that we should be considering structurally that might create even greater value for the shareholder base. So we made some good progress and thinking about that both from a technical and structural point of view, not any conclusion by a long stretch. So if and when we get to a point where we have some judgments on that, we’ll obviously get back with you and let you know. But we wanted to be very open-minded and we will always remain focused on maximizing value. And if there is different approach then, we are -- we would pursue it.
Joel Simkins: That’s very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Thomas Allen: Hi, good morning. So, two quick questions on China. First, last quarter you mentioned that F&B business looked like it was picking up a little bit. Now that you have the hard data for the first quarter, do you still feel confident in that? And the second question, can -- is there any way to quantify or think through how the association you did with Plateno Group for Hampton could kind of help your greater portfolio just as we see a kind of increase in outbound travel outside of China? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. The first one simple answer is, yes. We continue to see benefits of rebounding food and beverage. It’s not skyrocketing, okay. But from a pattern, we’re seeing significant declines quarter-over-quarter. Yes, we’ve start to see stabilization and recovery and we think it’s the beginning, hopefully of a good trend. On Plateno, as we outline when we announced the deal that is one of the primary drivers for why we entered into the relationship with those guys, was that, but we saw is that the development opportunities in China were changing. They’re going to up and down and be different over different periods of time. But ultimately, the economics are going to drive not unlike what I described, is going on with upscale here in U.S. and China with rising labor costs, rising cost of construction. The thing, the type of product that is going to make -- I think more sense broadly throughout China and in on a mass basis is going to be at that price point. And we looked at lots of ways to do it, in ourselves and with various partners. We picked Plateno because after a long process and a lot of work, we felt like given their success with 7 Days and their scale and their ability to drive the commercial side of the business, they were clearly far and away the best partner. And it was obviously driven by us making money and adding rooms. And I think it is going -- I know it's going to do that. But it was also sort of part of the underlying thesis that I keep describing, which is this loyalty affect. It works. We know it works. It works where we end up with scale and price point diversity and geographic diversity. We need those same things in China. The only way to get those things broadly in China and from a geographic point of view is that at this price point and we think they're the best partner to do that. We win in China and we create that loyalty effect. The 100 million going to 200 million travelers that are leaving China, we think are going to. We do our job, right, to be more loyal to us everywhere else in the world when they travel. So that is a very significant part of the underpinning for the strategy with Plateno.
Thomas Allen: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Rich Hightower: So just one quick twist on the dead horse we've all been talking about. Sorry to ask another question on this. But as I think about the organic versus non-organic growth argument that you sort of laid out previously, given your existing platform and infrastructure at Hilton, what is the cost to build a ground-up brand internally versus going externally? And then maybe you can help answer that by telling us what you have spent to date on Curio and Canopy and what you sort of pencil the returns at for those initiatives?
Chris Nassetta: I can do it pretty easily. De minimis investment, infinite returns. How’s that for a quick answer?
Rich Hightower: That’s pretty quick.
Chris Nassetta: We invest there -- I mean it’s mostly, honestly our time. I mean, I'm being a little cute in the sense that I'm not allocating the time to the people that are here. But it's mostly our -- given the size of our system and infrastructure that we have on a global basis and relationships we have with owners, et cetera. It is really for the size of our operation relatively de minimis okay. It's not -- it’s in the millions of dollars, not tens of million, which I view as pretty much immaterial for us. And the returns -- when I say infinite, maybe they are not quite infinite are exceptionally high because we invest very little and we build great platforms. So in Curio, it might be in the single of millions of dollars and we have 11,000 rooms open there in the pipeline. So the math is unbelievably compelling, which is why when we look at other individual brand opportunities, I’m not going to pick on any, but there have been a bunch that have being done recently over the last two or three or four years. We have looked at those. And in those cases said, we’re better off doing it organically. We’re going to drive better returns for our shareholders because it’s not just a growth that they can give. It is incremental growth that they could give us over what we could do on our own because we could do it on our own without making any investment. And when we’ve looked at the returns on that basis, our returns and we’re very disciplined about looking at -- when we invest capital, any kind of capital getting an adequate return, we really get returns on the basis, at least historically over the last few years. We’ve not seen returns that justified taking action. That doesn't mean that there are not opportunities in front of us where that equation changes. But it gives you a sense that  there is a really unique advantage when you get to be as big and when you have market -- the average market share that is this strong and 44 million honors members and you’re everywhere in 100 countries around the world and all these price points with 10,000 developer relationships you got a lot of values. There is a lot of value in that and our job is always to say, all right, what are our competitive strengths and how do we optimize our competitive strengths to create value for all of us to shareholders.
Rich Hightower: All right. Great. Thanks, Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Rich Hightower: And then one quick follow-up, I'm just wondering to the extent that you guys are familiar with Blackstone's thinking, why do you think we haven't seen any recent secondaries?
Chris Nassetta: That you would have to ask them. We know that they've started a process and they've done a couple of transactions. We know the business they are in is one that ultimately requires the recycling of capital. I do think that that is the pattern and that is the trajectory they’re on. Exactly when they decided to do it, I can honestly tell you it’s not my decision. And so I can’t give you color other than to say, I do think that the pattern that they established last year will continue at some point.
Rich Hightower: Okay. That's all for me. Thanks, Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is you’ve talked about getting to investment grade and potentially instituting a dividend sometime in the second half of the year. So, I guess I just wanted to get a sense of how much of a priority is that commitment to investment grade and returning capital versus, you talked about potentially at the right price, you might do something. You could do something if it worked strategically and all of those classifications that you added. Is being investment grade and paying a dividend something that would also be a filtering issue if you were going to do something?
Chris Nassetta: Let me address. I think I got the question. To be clear, Kevin stated it. We do want to become investment grade and we do think that range in debt to EBITDA that we’ve outlined consistently of three to four times, probably in the middle-ish or little bit lower that is probably where it takes to get there. We are very comfortable with the balance sheet with or without the investment grade status. And I want to be clear because we are not trying to be cute. We are -- we are prepared to institute a return of capital program starting with a dividend in the second half of the year subject to your Board making final decisions on that in advance of an investment grade status. So we are not -- we are not saying that has to precede the beginning of a return of capital program. If it does, great. I suspect honestly it will not, and that my view is we’ll be on a path to getting there and we can get there. And at the same time given the trajectory of the deleveraging, we can return capital as well.
Robin Farley: And similarly though it’s too, if you did a potential transaction, you talked about all the reasons why you might or wouldn't have to. Is paying a dividend something that would be a priority for, that that's something you would want to be able to do, even if you did a transaction?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I think that would get -- it's all hypothetical, I mean I think we are in the business of creating value so that would -- any transaction, it would sort of be -- it would be one of many, many factors I think that would be involved it, certainly don't view it as a driver. But we are committed to returning capital. So I do believe that it would be a consideration meaning anything that would stop us from returning capital would not be a positive because we are interested, I think the shareholder base is interested in our returning capital and we are as well.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. And then actually just an easy question on your guidance in Q1. Your management fee growth rate didn't move for the full year, even though Q1 was up 18%. Is that because of FX?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. So it’s pretty much all FX.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff Donnelly: Good morning, guys.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Jeff Donnelly: Just wanted to come back to the cycle question. Just I am curious rather than asking where we’re at, I’m curious, Chris, what are the metrics you look at to conclude whether we’re at the peak of the cycle or not, or is the edge only determinable once you’ve crossed over it?
Chris Nassetta: It’s hard to say. I mean one of that -- one of the things that gives me comfort that we are not at the peak are particularly close. If you look at any kind of historical perspective is what’s going out with occupancy gains, I mean really in my personal experience when I go back and think about when you are getting to peaks of cycles, it’s when you really are seasoning rate growth to a point where it -- in many cases over a 100% of your RevPAR growth and we are just nowhere near that right. We are still getting very -- we are going to have lower occupancy gains this year I think system wise than last year. Last year we’re 2.5 points in occupancy. This year we’ll be less, but we are still going to be close to 2 points of occupancy. It’s not the only metric, but I think it's a very healthy metric that your demand base is growing. At the same time, you are gaining pricing power. It’s certainly to me one of the great indicators that there’s a -- that you are in a very healthy part of the cycle.
Jeff Donnelly: And maybe just my angle on the Starwood question, maybe it's a two-parter, but are the goals of diluting down Blackstone's ownership and improving Hilton's balance sheet strategic enough to warrant consideration other than as a means to an end. And I guess maybe a follow-up is what concern do you have that their review leads to an existing competitor becoming a more formidable threat to you guys?
Chris Nassetta: I don’t think Blackstone or balance sheet, if you don’t do big M&A whatever it is, that’s all the issues, I mean -- it’s got to be strategically and economically driven, or you’ll screw up something, you will screw up a good company taking any other perspective than that. Second question was -- second part was...
Jeff Donnelly: Just whether or not you thought it might be an opportunity for a competitor that makes them more venerable?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean, no, I mean, I can’t. I don't lose. I don’t wake up in the middle of night losing sleep over that and simply because what I’ve described probably more than you guys want to hear today, I think we’ve got a -- I don’t want to say we are perfect and we have lots of things that I wake up every day and all night long worrying about that I want us to do better and we are working on and we will do better. But I like our setup, I like what we have, I like the momentum, I like the makeup of the company, I think it gives us lots of advantages. And so I can see why others might want to do something to sort of feel -- look and feel more like that and that ultimately they might be a more worthy competitor. But I think what we got is really, really good. And if we execute which I will promise we will and we are disciplined about how we manage the business. We got tremendous potential. So I can't -- I certainly don’t do deals and I don't think you’d ever want us to be doing deals defensively. I think we are great place. We do our job. We are going to stay in a great place. If we can incrementally add to that with whatever is out there, we should be thoughtful and consider those options and we should not do it in a defensive way ever.
Jeff Donnelly: Great. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Wes Golladay: Good morning, everyone. A quick question on China. What is your expectation for ADR growth this year, and what is leading it? Would it be the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities outpacing the lower tier cities or vice versa?
Chris Nassetta: I think that Tier 1 cities, Shanghai and Beijing are going to have pretty good years particularly Beijing because it’s had some tougher years so it’s coming back. I think the blended growth is still pretty balanced between rate and occupancy for the full year.
Wes Golladay: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Chris Nassetta: You bet.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I’ll now turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Nassetta.
Chris Nassetta: Well, thank you, everybody. That was a good robust call. We are happy to have the time to catch up. Obviously very pleased with not just the first quarter but momentum that we have I think going into what’s going to be another fantastic year for the industry and importantly, a fantastic year for Hilton Worldwide. We appreciate the time, look forward to getting back together with you after Q2 where we can update you on our progress, update you with more specific plans on return of capital. Hope everybody has a great day and talk soon.
Operator: This concludes Hilton Worldwide’s first quarter 2015 earnings call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Wednesday, February 18, 2015 at 10.00 AM Eastern Time. I will now turn the call over to your host, Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Charnaux.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Sally. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements.

In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures on this call you can find reconciliations to GAAP measures discussed in today’s call in our earnings press release which was posted on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We’re thrilled to report another quarter of strong results capping what I think was a banner year for Hilton Worldwide. For both the quarter and the year we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance, we also remained very optimistic on the fundamentals and macro setup for 2015 which I’ll cover a little later in my remarks. We ended the full year exceeding the high end of our RevPAR guidance growing 7.1% system-wide on a currency neutral basis. In the fourth quarter system-wide comp RevPAR increased 6.6% on a currency neutral basis and was led by Europe and the U.S. with quarterly system-wide RevPAR growth of 6.9% and 6.8% respectively in those regions. Much like last quarter we continue to see strong and balanced growth in both transient and group demand. This has provided the foundation for solid rate growth, but we’ve also continued to capture increased volume by driving demand particularly leisure demand into non-peak periods. Transient revenue grew nearly 7% at comp system-wide hotels in the quarter driven by bar and corporate negotiated growth of over 9% and 8% respectively. Government continued to strengthen in the quarter up 7% for the full year transient revenue also grew 7%. Group revenue growth was also strong up over 8% versus prior year in the fourth quarter and up nearly 7% for the full year in the Americas owned and managed hotels. We remain very positive on group business going forward. In the Americas owned and managed our group revenue position is up in the mid-single digits for 2015. Strengthening group is reflected in our strong, F&B performance with F&B revenue growing over 8% at our Americas owned and managed hotels in the quarter and nearly 8% for the year this continues to be driven by the rebounding group business and a more favorable group mix. For the year we saw a strong margin growth with system wide margins increasing a 190 basis points driving adjusted EBITDA growth of 13.5% to $2.508 billion. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $668 million an increase of approximately 11% from the fourth quarter of 2013 and as I noted earlier both the quarter and the full year came in above the high end of our guidance. Turning to development, we maintained our leadership position in key categories according to Smith Travel Research including global rooms under construction, pipeline size and system-wide rooms. We continue to lead the industry in net unit growth excluding portfolio acquisitions. In 2014, we added more than 40,000 gross rooms and 36,000 net rooms in 28 countries and territories contributing to 6% net growth in our managed and franchise segment. Our 12 distinct brands across 4300 properties and 715,000 rooms driving industry leading average global RevPAR index premium of 15%. These leading premiums drive superior returns for our owners and that in turn drives greater investment and faster unit growth. And by strategically deploying our brands globally we believe that we have the capacity to grow faster in every major region of the world which our recent performance would clearly support. Also important to note is that our leading net unit growth requires diminimous amounts of our capital, our entire pipeline of nearly 230,000 rooms requires approximately $100 million in contract acquisition cost in 5% of deals. Our rooms under construction globally make up almost 19% of the industries total rooms under construction which is more than four times our current share of open rooms. Our pipeline increased by approximately 35,000 rooms or 17% in 2014 and includes more than 1350 hotels and nearly 230,000 rooms in 79 countries and territories. More than half of the rooms in our pipeline are already under construction and all are in our capital light management and franchise segment. Including all agreements approved but not yet signed our pipeline totals approximately 245,000 guest rooms, again outpacing all other hospitality companies. In 2014, we approved more than 500 deals representing more than 82,000 rooms with no portfolio acquisitions or major investments. That is more than double our gross openings for the year. In the Americas, we signed on average more than one deal per day increasing our U.S. pipeline by nearly 30% to 100,000 total rooms. We also celebrated a number of development milestones in 2014. We welcomed our 2000 Hampton to the system, arguably the best brand in hospitality measured by RevPAR index performance in both guest and owner satisfaction, Hampton continues to distance itself from the competition. There are over 400 Hamptons in the pipeline and our recently announced partnership with Plateno hotels is expected to have hundreds of Hamptons in China over the next few years. Doubletree by Hilton continues to be one of the fastest growing upscale brands in the industry opening its 400th property in 2014. The brand has more than doubled in size since 2007 even after we removed nearly 10% of the brand to improve overall quality. We took a largely American brand and have strategically deployed it across six continents. We now have 54 Doubletree’s in Europe and 37 in Asia all where we previously had none. We have an additional 159 Doubletree’s in the pipeline globally with nearly 80% outside of the U.S. and it’s RevPAR index has increased over 700 basis points since 2007. Home2 Suites by Hilton continues to gain momentum as owners and guests love it value proposition since its launch in 2009, 45 Home2 Suites have opened with another 165 hotels in the pipeline. In fact we signed nearly 100 Home2s in 2014 alone. We successfully launched two new brands in 2014, both with a large base of signed deals. Curio, a collection by Hilton includes hotels that retain their unique identity by also deliver the many benefits of Hilton system. Curio, currently has 5 hotels open with 23 in the pipeline that would sign letters of intent. Canopy by Hilton debuted only four months ago and is redefining the lifestyle segment by creating a more accessible lifestyle brand. Canopy currently has 15 hotels in the pipeline or with signed letters of intent and we expect to open the first Canopy within a year. On the values enhancement front late last year, we announced an agreement to sell the Waldorf Astoria New York for $1.95 billion subject to a 100 year management agreement with the buyer Anbang Insurance. As part of the transaction, Anbang also agreed to complete a major renovation to restore the Waldorf to its historic grandeur. We are very pleased to have completed this sale and as of yesterday we have closed on all five previously announced acquisitions as part of the 1031 exchange for a total of $1.76 billion. In order to identify the properties for the 1031 exchange we conducted a very thorough process beginning before we announced the Waldorf transaction, we screened for high-quality urban and resort assets in very strong growth markets that complement our existing portfolio with the objective of maximizing long term value. Adding the Hilton Bonnet Creek, the Waldorf Astoria Orlando, The Reach and Casa Marina Waldorf Astoria resorts in Key West and the Parc 55 in San Francisco will expand our portfolio of owned hotel in Florida Resort markets and San Francisco a key growth market. The Parc 55 which represents over a third of the purchase portfolio by a number of rooms will be a new addition to the Hilton hotels and resorts brand. We expect that these hotels will not require any meaningful incremental CapEx in the near term. In the end we sold the Waldorf Astoria New York at a premium multiple and we have acquired great institutional quality assets in key urban and resort markets at a blended multiple below our current trading multiple have executed the purchases very quickly and as a result have captured a very significant EBTIDA and value arbitrage. Now, let me update you on our outlook for the year. On the heels of better than expected performance in 2014 we expect continued strong fundamentals to drive another great year in 2015 particularly in the U.S. where GDP growth forecast were recently revised upward. We think this bodes especially well for our portfolio given that 78% of our adjusted EBITDA comes from the U.S. market. The year is off to a good start and while there has been some disruption due to the weather, we still expect to have a strong first quarter. For the year we expect mid to high single digit RevPAR growth in the U.S. supported largely by a strengthening economy, a gradually improving labor market, rising corporate profits combined with below average supply growth. We expect strength in San Francisco, Florida, Chicago and Boston continued recovery in Washington DC and ongoing challenges in New York. For the Americas region outside the U.S. we anticipate mid single digit RevPAR growth for the full year given strength in Mexico and Ecuador tempered by some softness in Colombia, Argentina and Brazil. We expect performance in Europe to remain generally stable with RevPAR growth in the mid single digits for 2015, our guidance assumes solid fundamentals in the Western and Southern regions boosted by strong group business. Continuing uncertainty in Russia and the Ukraine however will likely pressure performance in the east while France remains soft. The Middle East and Africa region continues to recover nicely with improving economic growth likely to drive mid to high single digit RevPAR growth for 2015. Egypt in particular is showing great momentum with some headwinds on the Arabian Peninsula from less Russian inbound demand. Finally in Asia Pacific, we remain optimistic due in part to strengthen Japan and India and a positive momentum in Thailand. In China we expect relatively strong RevPAR in the 6% to 8% range and overall regional RevPAR growth in the high single digits for 2015. Overall our anticipated growth rates for 2015 around the world are largely stable to increasing compared to last year, that leads us to be optimistic about the year expecting a system wide RevPAR increase of 5% to 7%, about two-thirds of that driven by rate.  We continue to expect net unit growth of 40,000 to 45,000 rooms for the year or 6% to 7% increase in management franchise rooms. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015 is $2.79 billion to $2.87 billion reflecting the sale of the Waldorf Astoria New York, the subsequent completion of the 1031 exchanges and changes to our adjusted EBITDA presentation which Kevin will cover in more detail shortly. In summary, we feel great about performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2014, and also feel great about the setup for this year in addition to strong industry fundamentals. Our company’s specific attributes including large scale and unmatched geographic and price point diversity that create a loyalty effect should continue to drive market share premiums as well as topline, bottomline and net unit growth outperformance. With that, I’m happy to turn the call over to Kevin to cover things in a little bit more detail.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned we are very pleased with our results for the fourth quarter which meet our expectations. In the quarter system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 6.6% on a currency neutral basis driven by 3.1% increase in average rate and a 2.3 percentage point increase in occupancy to 71%. On an actual dollar basis, system-wide RevPAR increased to 5.3% in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items totaled $0.17, an increase of $0.06 over the fourth quarter of 2013, driving by higher operating income and lower interest expense partially offset by higher income tax expense. Total management franchise fees were $383 million in the quarter, an increase of 15% over the fourth quarter of 2013 driven by both topline and net unit growth. Total fee growth was over 15% for the year, exceeding our guidance. We continue to see strong growth in our base, incentive management and franchise fees which increased 11%, 20%, and 17% respectively for the year. As new hotels enter our system at published franchise rates that average 5.4% and existing hotels re-license or change owners and step up to those published rates, our effective franchise rate continues to increase growing 10 basis points for the year to 2.65%. There are ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $269 million, an increase of 6%. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $1 billion, and when adjusted for a non-comp increase in affiliate fees and a onetime gain, one time gain on a least we were bought out of in the first quarter of last year with 10% higher year-over-year. Operating margin growth at Americas owned and managed hotels grew nearly 150 basis points for the year. Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $102 million in the quarter was 11% higher than prior year. This was primarily driven by higher third party sales and commissions including a successful start to sales at the fee for service Grand Island [indiscernible] Hilton Hawaiian Village. Lower SM G&A expense, higher transient rental and improved club margins, early registration of New York time share units benefited the fourth quarter by approximately $12 million in adjusted EBITDA which we expect to reduce first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA by the same amount. We continue to gain great traction in transitioning our time share business to a capitalized business with 66% of intervals sold in the quarter developed by third parties. Our inventory includes over 130,000 intervals or about six years of inventory at our current sales pace, 82% of which is capital light. Over 60% of our time share sales are now from new rather than existing time share owners essentially the inverse of our competitors which should drive strong, more sustained system growth over time. Finally our corporate and other segment was $293 million for the year on the low end of our guidance of 3% to 5% increase. Growth across all regions supported favorable results in the quarter. Strength in the Americas continued as expected especially in the U.S. RevPAR increased 6.8% in the quarter with the rate gains accounting for just over half of that growth. Results were driven by both continued strong transient demand as well as accelerating growth in group revenue at our full service hotels, as expected calendar shift somewhat tempered growth in November. RevPAR our U.S. owned and managed properties rose 7.3% in the quarter due to robust group performance in the San Francisco Chicago and Los Angeles markets where group revenue increased between 15% and 25%. Our Hawaiian properties has also benefited from strong group business posting over RevPAR growth in the quarter. While our hotels in the east benefited from strength in Florida and Boston, solid momentum also continued in DC given particularly strong transient business. In the Americas outside the U.S. RevPAR grow at solid 6.5% for the quarter as transient strength drove meaningful ADR increases in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia offsetting softness in Porto Rico as a weak group business weighed on rates in the market. Moving into Europe, a gradual recovery led to regional results that were modestly better than the third quarter. RevPAR grew 6.9% in the quarter driven by a 330 basis points rise in occupancy and a 2.2% rise in rate. Additionally, growth accelerated versus the regions 5.7% average RevPAR increase over the prior three quarters. Results were boosted by a especially strong group business in the U.K. and Rome coupled with steady fundamentals in Germany, but we’re somewhat hindered by persisting challenges in Eastern Europe were declines in Israel and Russia offset strong performance in Turkey. Ongoing economic issue in France pressured fundamentals resulting in continued softness there. Sustained improvement in the Middle East coupled with easy comparisons offset softness in Africa, and resulted in strong RevPAR growth of 6.7% in our Middle East and Africa region in the quarter, meaningfully, ahead of the 3.6% average increase over the prior three quarters. Growth was entirely occupancy driven and largely supported by a robust performance in Egypt which benefited from large group volume and easing comparisons and mitigate the effective weakness in Arabia and Pennsylvania, which suffered from a slowdown in Russian demand. Increased competition hurt fundamentals in Saudi Arabia, while Ebola related travel restriction adversely impacted our hotels in Africa. In the quarter RevPAR in the Asia-Pacific region grew 2.9% partially driven by lower group business in Mainland, China which posted 2.8% RevPAR growth. Full year RevPAR growth in China remains strong at nearly 6%. Fundamentals in Japan remain solid with RevPAR of roughly 8% in the quarter and in Australia as well with RevPAR gains in the mid single digits benefiting from the G20 Conference in Brisbane. Southeast Asia continue to struggle with high resort fail short of expectations offsetting encouraging signs in Bangkok where demand finish ahead of expectations over the vested period. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents of $768 million of which $202 million is restricted. Asset closing of the Waldorf sale and the 1031 exchange acquisitions, we fully repay the $525 million mortgage of the Waldorf and assume $450 million mortgage on the Bonnet Creek Resort reducing leverage by about $75 million in the process. We continue to use substantially all of our free cash flow to repay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayment of $300 million on our term loan which brought our total voluntary debt prepayments to $ billion year, and our overall net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to 4.2 times. Our leverage target continues to be 3 to 4 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. With our expected EBITDA growth in 2015 including an incremental contributions from the completed 1031 exchange, and anticipated voluntary debt prepayments of $800 million to $1 billion. We expect to be within our target range during the second half of the year. At that point, we will explore returning capital to the shareholders most likely starting with the introduction of a dividend. Before we get into our outlook for 2015, I want to take a minute to discuss the impact of the strengthening dollar on our results. Over 80% of our full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA is in U.S. dollar or currencies peg to the dollar. Other than hedging certain of our unit company exposures that is not our policy to actively to hedge our cash flow. Our FX exposure is somewhat offset by in region overhead in CapEx, but given the recent sharp movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro, Australian dollar and yen, we’re expecting $35 million to $45 million of FX impact to our adjusted EBITDA outlook and have built in to our 2015 guidance. Turning to that guidance, as Chris mentioned our system-wide RevPAR guidance is between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to be between 4% and 6% on the same basis. To facilitate comparison with our competitors we will revising our presentation of adjusted EBITDA going forward to add back all non-cash share based compensation expanse. All of the guidance that I will walk through in a moment is based on the revised adjusted EBITDA presentation as well as the completion of all 1031 exchange transactions including the approximately $100 million of remaining Waldorf sale proceeds with which we intend to purchase one or more additional U.S. based strategic assets within the next six months. With that, we are expecting an adjusted EBITDA range of between $2.79 billion and $2.87 billion for 2015. We expect diluted EPS adjusted for special items to be between $0.78 and $0.83 for the full year. We expect management franchisee growth of 11% to 13%. We expect time share EBITDA of between $335 million and $350 million. And for the corporate and other segment to be roughly flat for 2015. CapEx spending excluding time share inventory is expected to total approximately $350 million to $400 million including about $265 million to $285 million in hotel CapEx which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. For the first quarter of 2015 we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis driving management and franchisee growth of 11% to 13%. We expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $555 million and $575 million and diluted EPS adjusted for special items of $0.10 to $0.12. Further detail on our fourth quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks and we’re now interested in answer any questions you may have. So that we may speak to as many of you possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally [ph] could we have our first question please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking question. Just doubling back Kevin to your comments on Europe, obviously the results in the quarter plus almost 7% on RevPAR basis were impressive. Are you guys and I know you call that a little bit pockets for 2015 where you’re expecting strengthen and some softness, nut as you think about in the quarter, could you kind of identify maybe where some of that strength came from. And then, in addition as you think about your guidance for next year in the FX headwinds which you’ve quantified, have you guys thought at all about the impact of the dollar appreciation and inbound travel to the U.S on any specific markets?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. Sure, Carlo. On Europe I think you’re asking about the outlook and I think we expect to continue to see strength where we’ve seen it. In Western Europe, a little bit in Southern Europe tempered by discontinued difficulties in Eastern Europe and certain market like France. But generally speaking, we think the trends in Europe are positive and we’ll continue in that direction which is reflected in our guidance. On the FX side we have – we continue to think about FX as I mentioned historically we’ve not hedge our cash flow exposure. Those remains a relatively small portion of the business than although $35 million to $45 million is more than we’ve seen in the last couple of years for FX, given what I would view is relatively sharp movements recently in the dollar versus other currencies. We’ll continue to look at that. And if expectations are such that that trend is going to continue to be that strong, we might change course, but historically we haven’t viewed it to be our job to bid on currency movement. And then in terms of impact to major markets in the U.S. so far we’ve not seen really any impact at all.
Carlo Santarelli: Great. Thank you. And then just quickly if I could. As you guys do think about, I know, Kevin mentioned, the second half, the institution of dividend, when you try and think about the investment grade rating and you think about the various uses of capital, what kind leads you to the conclusion that dividend would be your preferred means of capital return at this stage?
Chris Nassetta: Carlo, it’s Chris. I think as Kevin said in their prepared comments, where we think we would start, I don’t think we view certainly intermediate or longer term that it is the only way that we should return capital. We are committed to our leverage goals of being three to four times and I think we’ve been pretty consistent about that and consistent that when we get there. We think that that is the strength of balance sheet that gives us all the optionality that we need and get time and bad in it. Once we get to that point, we didn’t want to overcook the balance sheet and we’d be looking to start to return capital. And we’d be looking to do that initially with the institution of a dividend and to get in sync with our competitive set and then to the extent that we had excess cash flow beyond that and within the constraints of being at our targeted leverage levels, we would look to other forms of return on capital. I think in today’s world that would – it look like a stock buyback, but I think at the time we actually instituted obviously we’re going to get as good a sense for the marketplace as we can as to what people are looking for as shareholders to return the excess cash flow of the company to the owners of the company. But I think the first step I think we always thought is to get synced up with having a modest dividend, because our competitive set does and our sense is it would be good to open to another base of investors in the sense of getting yield investors and to be synced with our competitive set as we talk to investors out there.
Carlo Santarelli: Understood. Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis: Hey, good morning, guys.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning. Harry.
Harry Curtis: Chris, a question that we seem to get more often than not is your view on the lodging cycle. There is some view that it will be over within the next year or two. Just generally can you give us your thoughts on how this cycle might be different than prior cycles?
Chris Nassetta: Harry, I sort of remained very optimistic about where we are in the cycle sort of mid cycle and not to over simplify, but it’s sort of driven by the laws of economics. I think using the U.S. as a surrogate, because it is nearly 80% of our business. What we see in this market, we see broadly around the world, as I said, its either stable or getting better. And we see in the U.S. market a demand equation that’s getting modestly better as broader economic growth is getting better, which we think is going to continue to drive very strong trends in results. Group business is coming back as we’ve seen and reported both last year and as we look at position in pace coming into this year. So we think driven by broader economic growth demand, demand is growing and it is still being matched by historically low levels of supply, 2.5% is the 30-year average. Last year it was 1%, looks like this it will be a bit over that, but still far below the 30-year averages in a market condition where demand is growing modestly. That leads us to be quite optimistic about the next several years. One of those things has to change materially for us to be less optimistic and I at least don’t see that in the horizon over the short to intermediate terms. So we feel good about it and the results that we delivered last year, sort of the setup we see in real time in the business happening today in pace and position going forward, all generally support that. So, again, just driven by basic economic, we feel very optimistic.
Harry Curtis: Excellent, and then second question. Going back to your comments about the dividend but in a bigger topic which is value creation strategies, on the dividend are there any moves that you can make with respect to corporate structure that make sense at some point in the next year or two that would create incremental value?
Chris Nassetta: Be more specific.
Harry Curtis: REIT’s spinoff?
Chris Nassetta: That’s what I thought you were asking. But I just wanted to make sure.
Harry Curtis: I was too subtle, sorry?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Now I know. We certainly have been asked that a few times and talked about it, including on most of our earnings calls. And I think our view is the same which is we are constantly looking at the real estate obviously to maximize the value like we’ve done with the number of our big value enhancements opportunities most recently the Waldorf creating a huge value arbitrage. And we look at the bulk of the remaining real estate to think about how we maximize that in terms of operations, value enhancement, ROI opportunities, but also is there an opportunity structurally to sort of separate the businesses in a way that would create value. With the underlying sort of emphasis, it’s an obvious statement, but we’re saying that it’s all about maximizing value and creating value, so that is how we look at it. When we look at it including recently and we look at sort of a tax efficient way of doing its likely throughout structured transaction of a separation of the business which then starts to, in the analysis, require you looking at a market basket of multiples in the opco/propco world. When we look that, while there’s been a little bit more separation over the last three or four months, reality is when you look at a market basket, there is not enough separation relative to the incremental cost – onetime cost of doing it and incremental cost of having two entities or enterprises versus one where on paper, we think that there’s a significant value arbitrage. We are not resistant to the idea I think to the contrary. We are really driven just by the ultimate value arbitrage. We don’t see it at the moment as being meaningful arbitrage to the extent that we – if that changes, we will be the first be interested in pursuing the option.
Harry Curtis: Okay. Thanks, Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Joel Simkins: Hey, good morning, guys. I have to ask the obligatory time share question. Obviously your business is striving, you looks like you’re going to be the only major lodging company with a captive time share business. And Chris, what you’re thoughts on that business and at some point would you also contemplate a spin there?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I knew we would get that question, and it’s a totally fair question given what others have been doing. I’d say again, I’d start comment by saying, our objective and job is to maximize value. So to the extent there are things that we should be thinking about structurally from the standpoint of the engineering of the company if you will that would create more value, assume that we’re going to be looking at those things, real estate time share or any segment of the business. Having said that and you sort of implied it, Joel, in your question. We think our time share is different. I know everybody would say they are different. But we think it is different and special in the sense that we set out a course four years ago to really transform that business and get out of the capital intense part of it and make it much more like the management and franchise business which is such a profitable high margin business. And we have had tremendous success if you look at the numbers, the majority of the sales now are in the capital light segment. The amount of capital that were absorbed, that were consuming that businesses is a fraction of what it’s been and going down. We’ve grown our inventory by 60% in the last year. We now six years of inventory, Kevin covered it over 80% of which is capital light, which I think gives you a sense of where the business is going in terms of consuming capital and overall returns as the capital need goes down. And importantly it’s our most loyal customer in a sense of not just being loyal, they love our time share business, but they are very active supporter of the hotel side of the business spending a huge amount of money in the hotel side of the business. So for all those reasons, we like the time share business, because I think our business is different and we’ve done I think a good job of transforming into something that looks and feels a lot like the rest of the business and we think should have a value that looks and feels more like the rest of the business. But in the end we are all about creating value and so we are – that’s the view. We’re committed to the time share business, but we’re also always have our eyes open and always trying to be thoughtful about any opportunities we have to continue to create more value for shareholders.
Joel Simkins: Sure. And one quick follow-up, obviously your domestic pipeline continues to be strong. You have some lot of competitors out there. You have some people trying to play catch-up. As we get little bit deeper into cycle and there’s incremental competition for franchising deals. Are you seeing some of the terms struck out there change? And does that have – would that require you guys to commit some capital to any future deals?
Chris Nassetta: Not really, and not materially. I mean, I think again this sort of self-promotional for the company, but it happens to be true, I think the strength of our brands speaks for itself. Average market share of 115%, most of what’s getting done in the U.S. is in the limited service pace. We have pretty much either at the top or category killer brands in terms of market share. And you’re entering into multi-decade sort of agreements with people and I think they care deeply about what that ultimate performance is going to be. And I think that’s the reason why we are getting a disproportionate share of the development in the U.S. because of the strengths of those brands. We do occasionally, obviously do the supplement for important strategic deals with key money mostly very rarely another else. I haven’t seen any dramatic pattern either way. I think probably the best sort of best news or harbinger of things to come is we've actually been successfully been moving our average franchise rates up. So if you really get down, most of what’s getting done in the U.S. almost everything getting done in U.S. is limited service and its franchise, our pricing power has been growing, not shrinking in terms of what we actually able to charge owners and get them. They continue want to sign up with us and build our hotels because of the strength of those brands. So sure, long-winded -- short-winded way of saying what I just said is, we haven’t seen any – we’re still having great success in the U.S. I haven’t seen any real material difference. We signed as I’ve said on average one deal a day last year. So we’ve got good momentum coming in the 2015.
Joel Simkins: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. Two questions. First, can you give a little color on your China RevPAR guidance for next year is up 6% to 8%? I don’t know what it was in Q4 specifically, I mean, it’s in the Asia [ph] category. But if you could give a little color on that specially and then I guess what would be driving the acceleration in 2015 in your view, because I don’t know that sort of the genera view of the economy there is looking for acceleration?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. For the full -- that’s good question, Robin. For the fourth quarter for a bunch of sort of hotels specific reasons we were in the 3% range. In China for the full year we were sort of six, six plus. We think it’s sort of in that range, again this year on a comp basis and has a lot to deal with sort of where our hotels are both sort of diversity of the market as well as the individual locations in those markets. We’ve had a good – I mean, China is obviously seen some slowdown in broader economic growth. It’s still one of the highest growing markets in the mid to high single-digit in the world and while, we have seen RevPAR growth rates temper over the last two or three years. We are still managing to drive pretty healthy growth and we think we will. The other thing that sort of happening in China which is nice to see early days is as you starting to the food and beverage side is up a little bit. So we’re watching that very carefully with a lot of what’s being going on there, sort of government posterity setting the tone for the broader market. You’ve seen ancillary spend really impacted over the last couple of years. As I talk to our teams in China, real time talk to our team over there every week. It feels like – they feel that they are at the beginning of a little bit of a recovery, the purse strings are loosening up a little bit more in the ancillary spend area. So I think China, I think a good story I think from a growth point of view, continue to make really good progress. We signed more deal with the China in 2014 than we did in 2013. Now the complexion of those deals was different. It was a much heavier component of limited service, which is what we have been sort of planning on and driving towards, because we think that we’re going to get broad distribution. So, we feel good about the China story, but the specific answer, is it relates to individual assets and markets and locations, but we feel confident in that range.
Robin Farley: Great. Thanks. And then my other question was, your incentive fee growth, I guess what's embedded in the total fee guidance for 2015, is that 11% to 13%? Because with incentive fees, its look like they were up really strongly in Q4 and is that something that we should see it for moving here later into the cycle that we would see accelerating?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, Rob. I think that we have a couple of one-time items that affected both 2014 and that are going to affect 2015. But if you unpack that really for both years it’s kind of high teens growth rate, and that is something that as we’ve discussed in the past, as we open up more managed deals outside the U.S. that are internationally format with IMF that’s based on percentage of GLP versus the more standard U.S. format which is based on clearing and owners prior to return hurdle, you should see that growth rate accelerate, but if you unpack again the onetime items, the growth rate is relatively – is basically the similar for 2014 to 2015.
Robin Farley: And was there a big change then in the U.S. hotels paying incentive fees, that what percent at this point?
Chris Nassetta: It broadly moved up into the high 50s from sort of the low 50s and we expect contribution rate to go from the high 50s to the low to mid 60s in 2015.
Robin Farley: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for the color on the regional RevPAR expectations for 2015. But just focused on the U.S., a big debate in the market is just related to the performance of kind of the higher tier hotels versus the mid tier versus the lower tier hotels. You obviously have a good mix among the chain scales. Could you just give us your expectations of 2015 of chain scale performance? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Thomas, thanks for the question. I know, we’ve been answering that lot. I’m going to maybe oversimplify, but I think it will get to the answer you’re for. We look at last year obviously, I’d sort of break it down to for upscale and above and mid scale and below, because I think that broadly is sort of where you’ve seen performance differentials.  Last year, the lower end of the business under performed. If we look at our – if we blend that all together by about a 100 basis points the outperformed, the lower end outperformed the upper end by about 100 basis points. And that was on the sort of back of very strong transient growth. If we look at what we expect, both what we’re seeing this year. What we see in our group booking pace. What we see in the patterns on the upper upscale and above, we think that converges this year and is roughly equal when we actually blend that together. And that is because we expect continuing transient strength, but in the upper end of the hotels you’re now going to start to get more of the benefit of that group base, which is not only giving you more volume and then higher rated groups, but its giving you more leverage to leverage the better transient business, because you filled the big block of rooms with group and more so than last year. And I would expect as I’ve seen pretty much in very cycle, I don’t think this cycle is different in that regard. As you get beyond this year, I would think it will flip around. I think you’ll have the higher into the business outperform. But this year our best numbers are saying a consistent level of performance between the average of those two big segments.
Thomas Allen: Okay. And then just on your – the five assets you recently bought. I thought it was interesting that you bought two hotels in Orlando and you’ve been kind of shifting exposure away from the New York market. Can you just give some more color on kind of your expectations A, around Orlando, and the strength of that market, then also on New York? And then just an update on your relative exposure now that you sold the Waldorf and you bought those other assets? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I will take the last one first. Our relative exposure in New York going from 8% to little less than 5% on New York centric in terms of EBITDA contribution. In terms of the assets, I would say broadly, first of all, in Orlando its really one asset, I mean, we talked about it as the Waldorf and the Hilton, but if you’ve ever seen it its two towers connected by the meeting space that was built as one complex. It’s an amazing complex. We’ve been obviously involved from the beginning of it in a great location adjacent to Disney that has been building and building in terms of moment of the group business and being able to leverage off for that. For leisure business given its location, and we have very high expectations of the performance of that asset in that location in Orlando Key West, the two assets, again, sort of run as one asset, it’s probably in the U.S One of the hardest to duplicate locations that like you can pop up hotels in Key West. There's a pretty limited amount of land. And we feel very good about not just short term but long term value and performance on that. And then San Francisco I think everybody is pretty up to speed on San Francisco. A great asset – essentially adjacent to our existing Hilton. We can run it as basically one big hotel. We can Garner efficiencies out of both sides. We can drive by bringing in the Hilton system. We can drive incremental market share and what is one of the strongest growth markets in the country. When you blended all together, the way I would look at it is, short intermediate term, the growth rate from a RevPAR and even a point of view is probably about double what we existed. Forgetting even the multiple arbitrage, the RevPAR growth rates on average will be in the very high sort of high single digits and the EBITDA will be in the double-digit and both of those will be meaningfully higher than what we would have experience with the prior asset.
Thomas Allen: Very helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan. Your line is open.
Joe Greff: Good morning, everybody. What continue to surprise us, nicely surprise us to the upside is the level of occupancy gains that you finished on a system-wide basis in the Americas, little bit north of 75% system-wide just below that, I’m presuming that that or above your prior peak. Maybe can you talk about what you’re doing to incent your managers to push price? Maybe that’s a different than a year or two years ago. And when you think about your U.S. RevPAR guidance for 2015, what’s the mix there between rate and occupancy gains? Then I’ve a quick follow-up.
Chris Nassetta: We have been I think a really good job on occupancy. We’ve finished historically high occupancies last year. They were up to 240 basis points in occupancy. We do not think we will repeat that this year. Although I will say, embedded in our guidance is probably 1.5 points to 2 points in occupancy, which will mean, we’ll be at yet another historical high. You might say, why and are you driving rates, sort of embedded in your question or the second part of your question is, are you doing enough on rate. I think the answer is yes, and I think it is that not all days are created equal in our business, in most markets. Monday through Thursday we all know is a very different experience than Friday through Sunday, not everywhere but most places. And so what we’ve really try to do with our teams in their final analysis of business is bifurcate that into being. Its supper strategic about how we’re pricing in the high demand periods, and being thoughtful about how we price in the lesser demand periods, but recognizing if we can get, fill those rooms at reasonable rate that net cash flow, the properties, the bottom line is going to be better. So I know that all sounds easy, but it’s not and I think the short answer is one size is not fit at all. But that’s where we’re getting this occupancy gain is really a lot of leisure and a lot of weekends and some off-peak [ph] just being smarter and being more aggressive further out in time where we know we’re going to have weaker periods. If you look at rate versus occupancy this year embedded in our number sort of we’re going from roughly 55 – roughly 55, 45 or excuse me, roughly 50-50 to 65, 35. So there’s definitely a step up. But we want. We want weekend and off-peak occupancy. And I do think we’ll get 150 basis points to 200 basis points. It will obviously start to tempt – sort of there’s only so much more we’ll be able to do. It will be tempered I think as we get into next year and beyond. Did I attempt that you had a lot questions embedded.
Joe Greff: Yes. You touched on it Chris. One follow-up I have and you may have said this before or I may have missed it in a lot of data points that you talked about, but looking at your system-wide RevPAR guidance of 5% to 7% that’s on the currency-neutral basis. If we were to look it adjusted for where the U.S. dollar is relative to the Australian dollar and the euro, where would that be?
Chris Nassetta: It would probably be 4% to 6%, this is about a point in there probably for conversion to actual rate.
Joe Greff: Great. Thanks guys.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks Joe.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.
Felicia Hendrix: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Chris, in your prepared remarks you said that the group revenue position was up in the mid single-digits for 2015 for the Americas. I just wondering, could you give us the rate and volume components of that? And then also can you tell us what you’re seeing both in the quarter, for the quarter bookings, and then farther out for 2016?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. The split is 50-50, plus or minus between volume and rate on the existing group position. And pace has been very strong. I don’t have a first quarter pace number yet, but if I look at that same comp set that I reference that’s up in the mid single digits and position, I think the pace in the fourth quarter was up over 50% -- 57% is what I recall, but very strong pace. My impression, well, I don’t have final numbers. Honestly, January and February combined I saw some very early numbers that’s look like pace was strong, but I don’t have an exact number at the moment.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. And then just along lines with that question, the third quarter 2015 looks like it faces pretty tough comps, maybe you don’t have this detail on front of you, but just wondering what you might be seeing in that quarter?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. It’s pretty good. I don’t have the specific number in front me Felicia, my recollection is that first part of [indiscernible] group is a little bit weaker for us and the middle two quarters are relatively strong. So it is a harder comp, but we’ve been pretty well.
Felicia Hendrix: Okay. Great. And then just as a quick follow-up. Just wondering, are you seeing any changes in RevPAR index in any of your major geographies or among your major brand?
Chris Nassetta: No. We generally have seen modest upward trajectory across the entire portfolio. If we look at our full year index increase, it was about a half a point for the system which in the world we live and going up a half a point from the high levels that we’re at. We think is very strong, but generally increasing modestly across the brand portfolio, no issue of note in the sense of declines.
Felicia Hendrix: Great. Thank you so much.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley: Hey, good morning everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Hey, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley: I just wanted to follow-up on the owned portfolio. You said you addressed the REIT question head on. So I’ll ask a different spin, which is I think basically since we’ve been doing these calls now you’ve started with some time share opportunities and why you some I guess clean up at the Hilton New York in terms of monetizing some opportunity in the retails frontage there. And now you’ve done Waldorf something really successful there. Is there anything else as you kind of move your focus post-Waldorf that you kind of work on in terms of monetizing or getting a little more value of what you do own in the owned portfolio?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, of course. I touch on it quickly when I talked about sort of the broader real estate portfolio on a post-Waldorf. I think there are some more – what I would sort of define as value and enhancement opportunities, which is more change of use type of opportunities. We’ve talked about at least to one of those another property in Hawaii where we been with the local municipality and are pretty much done with the process or close to it to convert one of the towers at the Hilton [indiscernible] to time share. Now we have other product, we’re selling in that market. So we’re not in a rush to do it, but it will be great additional supply of product and I think a great way to maximize the value of that asset, which is a great hotel, but too big for the market in relative to air lift into that market, its always been too big. We have a couple others that on various stages of sort of analysis in work that might be again components like at the New York Hilton of existing owned hotels where higher and better use, might be some component of time share. So I do believe we’ll talking to you about some of those over time in the coming quarters. And then it’s a big portfolio and I don’t think we should under estimate that, because it’s what we do every day. I should let Kevin talk because he's responsible ultimately for the real estate side as well. But ROI opportunities are not insignificant. I know they are not sexy doing the Waldorf, obviously a sexy and we’re very proud of that and excited about it, but there's lots of investment opportunities in a portfolio this large over time to make what are very modest investments that drives very, very high IRRs and so we’ve been doing a number of those. I honestly think that we have an opportunity to do even more than we have done. So may not be – there are few more to come that are not insignificant, but adding up a bunch of the ROI stuff I think over time will help create lots of value.
Shaun Kelley: Perfect. And my follow-up question would be little bit of a different vain. Just any sense or direction you can give us for how many of your, I guess, new hotel agreements or kind of signed franchise agreements come from existing owners versus I guess people that are new to the Hilton system or to the Hilton family?
Chris Nassetta: I think on average around the world its 75%, I think if you look at in the U.S. it’s like 90%, weak in fact, but that’s order of – sort of directional right. It's the majority of the business and in the U.S. it’s the vast majority of the business.
Shaun Kelley: Meaning new agreements coming from existing owners?
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Shaun Kelley: Perfect.
Chris Nassetta: Yes. In the U.S. I think it’s like 80% and I think around – if you blending the rest of the world I think its 70%, 75% stuff like that.
Shaun Kelley: Got it. That’s really helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent: Hi. I have one quick question, which is in terms of the 6% to 7% supply growth, how much of that is select service brands and how are you balancing sort of the Hilton Garden Inn versus the Hampton Inn profile and why are certain owners picking one over the other?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. In the 6% to 7% I think implied in this roughly an even split. If you look at what’s under construction around the world today in our 120 whatever thousand Steve, it’s about 60/40 full service and above actually, but that given the growth in the U.S. market that will sort of flip around a little bit. So I’d say, it’s probably 50-50, or probably very close to 50-50. In terms of HEI versus Hampton it has a lot to do, almost all to do with market demand sort of drivers. I mean, Hampton is a slightly lower price point and slightly different product in the sense of more limited services, a little bit smaller room, little bit less than the food and beverage, a little bit less all around. It’s an amazingly strong brand. As I said I don’t think there is a stronger in the business in my opinion. But it is little bit different than Garden Inn and so it really depends on the type of demand wanting a more – a simply product where there is a little bit more need for more – a little more F&B, a little bit meeting space, a little bit figure room product I think it drives towards the Hilton Garden insight. So it’s really just – the demand in any particular location within a market, what do we think, what would you think the price point is that will drive the economic results.
Steven Kent: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Steve.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Crow with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Bill Crow: Hey, good morning guys, one quick question and then follow-up. Hi, Chris. As far as value creation and owned real estate is it possible that after you’ve identified all of these additional assets in the 1031 exchange process, maybe there’s an opportunity the Hilton New York or Hilton San Francisco and Towers, and exploit the global inflow of money into the U.S. looking at hotel deals to do some similar maybe obviously less dramatic fashion in the Waldorf or are asset sales beyond the Waldorf off the table?
Chris Nassetta: Nothing is ever off the table, I mean, we are always looking at the opportunity for assets sales, they have been pretty good [indiscernible] so I don’t think there’s any really material ones that make sense. I think the Waldorf, Bill, is pretty unique in the sense of that value arbitrage opportunity. The Hilton New York is a New York asset but I don’t think it has the same qualities as the Waldorf that allowed us to do that. So, I don’t really see that there. The other thing is, we did I think a very, very fine job and took advantage of market conditions and frankly took advantage of the fact that we were a quick all cash buyer on its supertanker kinds of assets that allowed us to drive what I would say to you is better than normal market pricing on a multiple basis. I don’t think we can do that all of the time. So we did it for almost $2 billion and we’re able to put this together in a way we were – we think it’s an amazing complement to our profile, the existing assets that its joining great for the growth rate, et cetera. But one, I don’t think you could expect to get sort of market multiples on either the sell or the buy that would create the arbitrage that we were able to create at Waldorf. I wish that we could say we would, but I don’t think that I would lead you down that path. I think the think bulk of the rest of the real estate, with maybe some very minor exceptions, we will think about more as the opportunity to do a structured deals and think about it as a portfolio that you would build that would have good market exposure and the right market surround the country that would – that has a standalone would be a very attractive standalone.
Bill Crow: Chris, my follow-up is that we’ve seen an uptick in incoming calls and potential M&A and maybe part of that is emanating from some of the news coming out from one of your peers, can you just talk about the challenges that you would envision for putting together a couple of brand companies and maybe what the benefits would be ultimately of M&A in this space?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. I mean, I can’t talk about it for anybody else, so I won’t. I can talk about it from our point of view. And I think one of the things that’s very nice about where we are and I think from an investor point of view people should think as a real positive is that, as a result of what we have put together and how we’re making it work. We’re able to do what we do, which will lead the industry in the major metrics including an importantly net unit growth as a percentage of installed base without having to go out and acquisitive. Why? Because we have these amazing – we have these great scale, geographic distribution, price point distribution and brands that are underneath it, that have the premium market share in the industry and so. And we’re adding as a result of that base, we’re able to sort leverage off that and add brands like Curio and Canopy and maybe other thing that we can do organically, at an astronomically high yield, because the investment to add those brands is frankly diminimus as compared to going out and becoming acquisitive and thinking about inorganic growth. So way I think about it from our point of view is where I’ve always said it, you would never say never, because that is the dumb thing for any CEO to say. If there was an opportunity that we thought that was a great strategic fit where we can create huge amounts of value, you and we would want to pursue it. But we have not been sort of bounty hunting or particularly acquisitive, because we haven’t needed to be. We can deliver what we are trying to deliver which is outperformance across the board, but particularly on growth without having to do and we’re doing it on a much higher yield basis that going out and buying things.
Bill Crow: Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vince Ciepiel with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Vince Ciepiel: Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question.
Chris Nassetta: Sure.
Vince Ciepiel: And my question relates to margin within the owned business. It has showed good progress in 2014, so first maybe how did that compared to your initial expectations and if there was a delta, what drove that? And then secondly, with the Waldorf transaction how does that impact margins on a year-over-year basis for 2015 and how much core growth from a comp hotels are you assuming in the outlook?
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Vince. It’s Kevin. I think relative to the full year for 2014 it was roughly in line with our expectations. I think in our least portfolio FX might have hit us a little bit or maybe came in a little bit lower than we thought. And then going forward we still think we can maintain pretty good margin growth in the owned portfolio. I think as Chris mentioned before the assets that we were buying do have – we do expect to have higher growth rates on the bottom line than our existing portfolio. So it will be some improvement. But you got to remember in the context of a $1 billion business it’s not going to move the needle all that much in terms of margins. They will perform better if their outlook comes true, but I don’t think it will move the needle all that much on our over basis.
Vince Ciepiel: Got it. And then a quick follow-up, you mentioned FX, are you guys guiding 11% or 13% fee growth, you think about the FX headwind. What type of headwind is it to fee growth within the business and how much of that you overcoming next year?
Kevin Jacobs: 60% of what we’re putting into the guidance in the fee business and about 40% is in the rest of the business and that’s all embedded in the 11% to 13% guidance.
Vince Ciepiel: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Rich Hightower: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question here. Just one, I was curious for a more detail on the share based comp add backs and I know that the guidance build up in the back show some detail. It does show I think a far higher amount of the add backs relative to 2014? And if you guys could just lay out what some of the moving parts are there?
Kevin Jacobs: Yes. We can take you through Rich some of the detail Christian and Jon [ph] can take you through offline, but you’ll recall last year we had a onetime credit from the conversion of some of our programs related to the IPO, so that’s really the difference there you see between 2014 and 2015.
Rich Hightower: Okay. Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose: Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask, you might have address this, but your RevPAR and you owned assets is the point below your system-wide outlook. Is there something specifically pulling that down or is it just surprised given your enthusiastic comments around group bookings for the year?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Smedes, there’s really two factors. One is in the lease state where the FX that we build into the guidance hits a little bit harder than it does in the rest of the business and then a little bit in New York and that’s it.
Smedes Rose: Okay. And then with your time share outlook, looks like it’s down year-over-year for EBITDA, is that just reflective of the kind of asset light more management fee business that you’re moving forward?
Chris Nassetta: It’s really we mentioned in the fourth quarter we have a little bit of a timing issue on revenue recognition where a little bit more came in the fourth quarter which drove our beat in the fourth quarter and we think that that comes out sort of dollar for dollar in the first quarter. There’s a little bit in there in terms of the mix as we convert to fee for service, but it’s mostly that time issue.
Smedes Rose: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Chad Beynon with Macquarie. Your line is open.
Chad Beynon: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a big picture one, we’ve seen some companies begin to reward travelers slight more aggressively with points and perks during the past several quarters. And recently one of your competitor is launching a free world-wide WiFi initiatives. So I guess my question is, when you went through the corporate negotiated rates a few months ago with your partners, are corporate starting to push for more perks in the industry. So maybe if you can give some color on kind of where this is going, and if that matters at all or if it’s really just brands and location with your corporates that kind of roll that conversation? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: I think not to give you a short answer but I think it’s the latter that you described. I do not sense and certainly from world-wide point of view that in these corporate rate negotiations or volume negotiations we’re giving more away, frankly I think it’s becoming more of a seller’s market than a buyer’s market so I think we are doing less of that not more of that, I think some of the things that you are seeing people do on Wi-Fi has to do with sort of a different objective which is continuing desire to channel shift people in the more direct channels to lower distribution cost, I think I would view that as a good thing generally for the industry and for individual players.
Chad Beynon: Okay. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes
Operator: I would now turn the call back over to Mr. Chris Nassetta
Chris Nassetta: Well thank you everybody. We appreciate the time and attention today. I am very pleased with everything we accomplished last year as I said it was a banner year and equally pleased with the setup and what we see so far this year and what we expect for the remainder of the year and look forward to talking to you after our first quarter to give you an update on everything. Thanks again for joining us today.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Results Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). Please note that this call is being recorded today Friday, October 31, 2014 at 10.00 AM Eastern time. I will now turn the call over to your host, Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Charnaux, please go ahead.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Courtney. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Before we begin, we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our third quarter results and will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2014 and into 2015. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thank you, Christian. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We’re pleased to report another quarter of great results highlighted by strong top line revenue growth, fee growth and ownership segment performance which led to results above the high end of our guidance on both the top and bottom line. The macro setup for the balance of the year and into next feels great and as a result we've raised our full year RevPAR growth, adjusted EBITDA and our EPS guidance. In the third quarter, we exceeded our guidance for system-wide comp RevPAR growth of 8.4% on a currency neutral basis posting our highest quarterly growth rate this cycle. Growth was driven by a 4.2% increase in average rate and a 3.1 percentage point increase in occupancy to 79% and was led by the U.S. with quarterly system-wide RevPAR growth of 8.8%. We’re pleased to see continued increases in our global RevPAR index across our brand portfolio increasing 70 basis points year-to-date. We saw very strong and balanced growth in both transient and group demand in the quarter. Transient revenue grew over 8% system-wide in the quarter. In the Americas, we saw particular strength with system-wide transient growth increasing from 7.7% in Q2 to 8.8% in Q3. Group revenue growth in the quarter was also very strong, up 9% system-wide primarily driven by volume. Performance was driven by strong results in both the Americas and Europe with the Americas benefiting from solid convention and company meeting volume. We remain on track to deliver mid-to high single-digit group room revenue increases for the full year. We also remain positive on group business going forward as our group revenue position in the Americas system-wide is up in the mid-to-high single digits for the next four quarters. In the quarter F&B revenue grew 8% and our owned and managed hotels in the Americas on pace with RevPAR growth. We attribute the bulk of the growth to rebounding group business and a more favorable group mix. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $645 million, an increase of over 13% from the third quarter of 2013 and above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 160 basis points. Let me spend a few minutes on development highlights, we maintained our number one rankings in key categories according to Smith Travel Research including rooms under construction globally, pipeline size and system-wide rooms. Even with the largest base of rooms in the industry, our growing pipeline represents three times our current share of global room supply. In the quarter, we opened 70 hotels or over 12,000 rooms in 177 hotels and nearly 30,000 rooms year-to-date through the third quarter. As of quarter-end, we had more than 705,000 rooms operating globally and with last week's opening of our first Hilton in Myanmar; we've increased our global presence to 94 countries and territories. We had 559 hotels and 109,000 rooms under construction at quarter-end representing more than 50% of our pipeline. Our pipeline continues to grow now with 1269 hotels and approximately 215,000 rooms in 74 countries and territories, all in our capital light management franchise segment. For comparability including all deals approved but not yet signed, our pipeline would have been approximately 230,000 rooms. In the third quarter, we approved 123 hotels with over 20,000 rooms for development. Two weeks ago, we gathered over 1800 of our hotel owners at our Global Owner's conference in Orlando, Florida. At the conference, we formally launched our 12th brand, Canopy by Hilton, an accessible lifestyle brand. We believe this brand will be a game-changer because it appeals to a much wider audience than the traditional lifestyle concepts. Instead of a small sliver of the luxury segment, accessible lifestyle opens up demand more broadly, thus giving us the ability to serve more customers and add meaningfully to our growth over time. Canopy takes lifestyle out of the dark ages with a light, organic and contemporary look and feel. It's designed to be welcoming and also reflect the local neighborhood flavor and culture where each hotel is located. And we've designed it in such a way that Canopy will be efficient to build or convert, driving a very compelling return on investment for our owners. We launched Canopy with 11 signed deals from a select group of owners with hotels in key urban neighborhoods and vibrant secondary markets including Portland, San Diego, London, Nashville, Savannah, Indianapolis, Washington, DC and Miami. We also have another 15 Canopies in various stages of discussion. Third party capital will drive Canopy's growth just like it does for all of our brands. In our view, industry leading brands and revenue engines that resonate with customers and provide attractive returns to owners should not require meaningful amounts of our capital to either launch or grow. We also continue to have extraordinary developer interest in Curio, our recently launched collection of unique 4 to 5 Star hotels. We’re in discussions on more than 90 properties and we've already opened 3 properties totaling over 2800 rooms since the brand launched in June including the SLS Las Vegas Hotel & Casino, the Highland in Dallas and as of yesterday the Diplomat in Hollywood, Florida. In total, Curio plans to open five hotels totaling almost 3200 rooms by year-end. We believe that new brands such as Curio and Canopy help further our goal to serve any customer, anywhere in the world for any lodging need they have. By doing so, we drive more customer loyalty, higher market share premiums, better returns for our hotel owners and that in turn drives faster net unit growth that should ultimately drive premium returns for our shareholders. We can also serve more customers by intelligently deploying our existing brands in different regions around the world and optimizing those brands for local markets. For example, we believe that having a full portfolio of brands with hotels for every type of guest travel need will be as crucial in China as it is in the developed markets. As result, we've recently launched our Hilton Garden Inn and Embassy brands in China and just yesterday, we announced plans to launch the Hampton brand in China. We plan to leverage the expertise of a new partner, Plateno Hotels Group, under an exclusive license agreement to develop the mid-scale 3 to 3.5 star hotel market in China with the Hampton brand. The intent of this agreement is to deliver over 400 hotels with the first expected to open by the end of next year. We’re thrilled to partner with Plateno, a proven hospitality leader in China, operating over 3000 hotels in 300 cities across China under five brands including the highly successful 7 Days Inn brand. With over 80 million members, Plateno's loyalty program will serve as an important source of guests for Hampton in China and also provide Hilton an opportunity to link these consumers to Hilton HHonors and our full portfolio of brands. The partnership is a win-win for both companies where both sides will be able to leverage their considerable talents to make Hampton by Hilton in China a great success. Simply stated, we expect that this agreement will allow us to accelerate our efforts to gain broad geographic end chain-scale distribution in China enabling us to access a large, growing customer base for both in-country and outbound business and all on a capital light basis. We are also serving more guests than ever in our luxury brands with over 78 Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels open or in the pipeline. We expect this momentum in luxury to continue particularly with the sale and redevelopment of the Waldorf Astoria New York announced earlier this month. We believe the announced deal is a home run for both our partner Anbang and for us and we’re on track to close the transaction as previously disclosed. We intend to unlock the significant embedded value in the Waldorf Astoria by using sale proceeds to acquire additional U.S. hotels in a like-kind exchange. We’re making great progress identifying specific properties and are very confident in our ability to complete the exchange. The hotel will remain in our system beyond all of our lifetimes as it will continue to operate the property under a 100 year management agreement. The property will also undergo a major renovation funded by our partner that will restore the property to its historic grandeur, making it a true flagship for the Waldorf Astoria brand. Now let me update you on the outlook for the remainder of the year and provide some preliminary guidance for 2015. Overall, we remain very optimistic about fundamentals, especially as it relates to the U.S., which has remained a source of relative strength. In the U.S., we expect fundamentals to remain particularly healthy as economic growth and an improving job landscape continue to drive strong demand trends and supply growth remains muted. We’re maintaining our high single-digit RevPAR growth expectations in the U.S. for 2014. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we also still expect high single-digit RevPAR growth for the full year 2014 as strength in Mexico offsets a weakening Brazil. Overall performance in Europe continues to be strong. We expect positive momentum in Western and Southern Europe to continue with lingering softness in France. Uncertainty in Russia and the Ukraine will likely weigh on Eastern European results through the remainder of the year. Overall, we maintain our mid-single digit European RevPAR growth forecast for the full year 2014. Middle East Africa region is recovering nicely overcoming uncertainty surrounding the situation in Syria and Iraq. We expect strength in Egypt to continue due to easy comparisons and what we hope is the beginning of a sustained recovery. We think RevPAR performance in the region will be up in the mid-single digits as tailwinds from Egypt and Saudi Arabia offset headwinds in other parts of the region. Finally in Asia-Pacific, our expectations remain consistent with what we outlined in August. We continue to anticipate mid-single digit RevPAR growth in the region for 2014. We expect growth in Japan to remain strong, although tempered by new consumption taxes and performance in China to remain steady. Additionally, we think the uptick in trends in both India and Indonesia will continue, although challenges in Thailand will likely remain a regional drag. Given our strong Q3 performance and continued solid fundamentals, we’re raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance $30 million at the midpoint to $2.47 billion to $2.49 billion with our new midpoint above the upper end of our previous range. We’re also raising our system-wide RevPAR growth guidance for the year to 6% to 7% and our diluted earnings per share guidance range for the year to $0.69 to $0.71. We continue to expect net unit growth of 35,000 to 40,000 rooms or a 5.5% to 6.5% increase in managed and franchise rooms. Looking forward to next year, we continue to feel great about the fundamentals and the performance we can drive with our industry leading brands and demand generation capabilities. As a result, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase 5% to 7%. We also think our strong development pipeline will support unit growth acceleration in 2015. This should translate into global net-rooms growth of approximately 40,000 to 45,000 rooms or 6% to 7% increase in managed and franchise rooms. Finishing up, we obviously feel really good about the performance this quarter and about the setup in terms of fundamentals of the business for the rest of the year and into next. With that, I'm happy to turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs to get into a little bit more detail on the quarter.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris and good morning everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the third quarter which significantly beat our expectations. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.19, ahead of our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.17, driven by our system-wide RevPAR and unit growth performance. Total management and franchise fees were $383 million in the quarter, an increase of 16% over the third quarter of 2013, driven by both new unit and top line growth. We saw strong growth in both our base and incentive management fees. Incentive management fees were driven by increases in participation rates and growth outside the United States where those fees typically do not stand behind an owner's priority return and where we derive about 75% of our total fees. Adjusting for a $5 million reclassification from base to incentive fees made in the third quarter for a small number of hotels, base fees grew 14% and incentive fees grew 21% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, which is not impacted by the adjustment just described, base-fee growth was 12% and incentive-fee growth was 24%. Given the strength to date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we are increasing our comparable management and franchise fee growth estimates by 200 basis points to 13% to 15%. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $260 million. Adjusted for a non-comp increase in affiliate fees, ownership-adjusted EBITDA was 16% higher year-over-year and this performance was driven by RevPAR growth for the segment of 7.3% and strong margin growth at owned hotels globally which grew over 160 basis points. Our timeshare adjusted EBITDA of $78 million in the quarter was 9% lower than prior year. This was primarily driven by unfavorable revenue recognition timing. Segment EBITDA is up 13% year-to-date compared to last year and we continue to see our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITDA guidance in the range of $315 million to $330 million. In addition to recently announced timeshare projects at Hilton Hawaiian Village and Hilton New York, we recently signed a sales and marketing agreement with a third party for our first timeshare project in Maui, which will consist of over 20,000 intervals and is expected to begin sales in 2016. In total, our inventory now includes over 130,000 intervals, or about six years of inventory at our current sales pace. That is a year-over-year increase in inventory of 58%, over 80% of which is capital light. Our corporate expense and other segment was $76 million in the quarter compared to $73 million during the prior year. We continue to expect growth for the segment of 3% to 5% for the full year. Our regional results were marked by strong growth in the Americas, ongoing recovery in Europe, stable growth in the Asia-Pacific market and improvement in the Middle East and Africa region, which benefited from solid performance in Egypt and Saudi Arabia given easier year-over-year comparisons as Chris described. RevPAR growth in the U.S. accelerated in Q3 increasing 8.8% with 55% of that growth driven by rate. While favorable supply-demand dynamics supported solid industry fundamentals we believe our chain scale diversity together with our brand strength contributed to our outperformance. RevPAR at our U.S. owned hotels rose 9.5% in the quarter driven by strong group performance in San Francisco, New Orleans and Chicago. Furthermore, we saw results in Washington, DC up meaningfully mostly due to an uptick in leisure activity and company meetings. Results in the Americas outside the U.S. were strong with RevPAR up 8.3% as our hotels in Brazil benefited from World Cup gains. In July for instance, ADR in Brazil increased over 70%. Puerto Rico was also helped by strong transient demand. In Asia-Pacific, RevPAR grew 3.4% boosted by solid increases in greater China which was up 7% in the quarter. RevPAR growth in Guangzhou was up nearly 18% while Shanghai rose 11% and Hong Kong rose 10% despite the recent protests. Fundamentals in Japan and Korea remained solid although growth was tempered by a typhoon and softening trade conditions respectively. Political unrest in Thailand continued to weigh on results for the region. In Europe, fundamentals continued to rebound. Overall occupancy rose 250 basis points while average daily rate increased 3.3%, resulting in a 6.6% RevPAR gain for our European portfolio above the 5.2% gain we experienced in the first half of the year. Our Southern and Mediterranean hotels continued to outperform with Greece and Portugal posting particularly healthy demand during the summer season. Northern and central Europe posted meaningful games as strong event calendars aided German and UK regional hotel performance. Our owned and operated hotels in Eastern Europe were virtually flat as weakness stemming from geopolitical conflicts offset gains from a strong Middle East travel season. As expected, economic uncertainty weighed on hotels in France. Lastly, Middle East and Africa RevPAR rebounded up 15.5% in Q3 versus a 2% decline in the first half of 2014. The growth was driven entirely by occupancy gains and as noted earlier, was largely the result of good performance in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $831 million, including $288 million of restricted cash and had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We continue to work towards our objective of achieving investment grade status by using substantially all of our free cash flow to repay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayment of $250 million on our term loan with an additional payment of $100 million in October which brought our total voluntary debt prepayments to $800 million year-to-date. As a result of our continued strong performance, we’re again increasing our expected term loan debt prepayment range by $100 million at the low end to $900 million to $1 billion for the full year. Finally let's turn to our outlook for 2014 for the full year. As Chris mentioned, we’re raising our system-wide RevPAR guidance to between 6% and 7% on a comp currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 5% and 6% on the same basis. We’re increasing our guidance for diluted EPS adjusted for special items to between $0.69 and $0.71 for the full year and for adjusted EBITDA. We are expecting a range of between $2.47 billion and $2.49 billion. Capital spending, excluding timeshare inventory, is expected to total approximately $350 million including about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. For the fourth quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 6% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $630 million and $650 million and diluted EPS of $0.16 to $0.18. Further detail on our third quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. So, that we may speak to as many as you possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Courtney, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.
Felicia Hendrix – Barclays: Regarding the Waldorf cell the sale of the Waldorf and attended when exchange, I'm just wondering what type of hotel assets are you looking to buy with the proceeds? Are you focused point domestic and International, are you focused on five hotels that are currently put in branded, would you consider buying other hotels and converting them? And then what's your view on buying hotels that may need significant CapEx?
Chris Nassetta: We have been hard at work on the 1031 and since we announced it but honestly before we announced it, while we couldn't be out actively in the market prior to the announcement we were tracking everything that was available very closely and have now been very, very actively engaged in the markets. I think the first of all, simply stated to do the Tiffany what it all has to be domestic U.S. assets in order to qualify as a 1031 so it will not be any components of International. And I think it terms of the types of assets it wouldn't surprise you to know that we are looking at institutional grade assets in the best urban and Resort destinations. We’re looking at large single assets and some portfolios that would be in those types of locations. Generally, it is not exclusively in the upper upscale and above so upper upscale in luxury segments of the business and a mixture of assets that are pre-existing and our portfolio within our poor photo brands today in those that are not with the objective ideally been to have a blend of those things so that as we put this money to work reported to working great assets and great markets and do it at a great price to create – to firm up the very significant arbitrage between what we’re selling for and what we are buying for to the extent we can do all those things and grow the system that's a very positive thing so that is what we are trying to accomplish. As I said we’re making very good progress. We are very confident in getting it done probably give the timeframes over the next 60 to 90 days really probably the next 60 days will be giving you a more specific detail on what assets markets, etcetera.
Felicia Hendrix – Barclays: Then just as a follow-up on your development pipeline outside of the U.S., I'm just wondering you guys sound very bullish and how have internationals and trending this year versus your expectations. And sure you've heard some of the comments that comment that you're peers at made on similar calls and specifically some of them have talked about seen some developers and China having financial difficulties, wondering why that shouldn't be a concern for us?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, the good news story – the reason we’re optimistic is what we've been talking about frankly as part of the IPO and since is the objective we have from a development strategy point of view and a brand strategy point in view is to win everywhere meaning it is a big world, things ebb and flow and we feel like if we have the right brand both existing and we launch the right brands and we adapt those brands intelligently for different market conditions that we can continue to grow in good times and bad and that growth may ebb and flow and be higher or lower in various pieces around the world, but nonetheless we can continue to grow which is why only is our pipeline growing but you see in our preliminary guidance for net unit growth next year that we’re stepping up our expectations of new unit openings. So we are still very, very confident in our ability to do that. We’re continuing to see healthy growth really in all regions of the world. We have had I think good strategies in Europe where we needed to that was more focused early on for value proposition limited service and conversion and in China I would say we just opened our 50th hotel. We have 150 hotels in the pipeline I know others have commented it, some of the progress has slowed. I think that's right. We are over 70% of our 150 hotels in the pipeline in China are under construction, so I'm confident that those hotels are going to open. Might take a little bit longer so I think there's no question things have slowed a bit in China but what's really happening in China in my opinion is something that frankly we've been talking about for the last couple years which is the complexion of what's going to happen there is going to change. That like other parts of the world, China what is going to get developed is going to change and it's going to be changing based on overall demand patterns and overall demand patterns suggest that the greatest demand is going to be in the midmarket. Reality is that big international companies that have captured the high end pretty well and the local companies like Plateno and 7 Days have captured the low end and we think that there is a huge opportunity in the midmarket both because nobody has really captured the flag so to speak but also that's where the greatest amount of demand is going to be. And so it's a great example of how we’re adapting, this year alone without even the launch of Hampton, just with Garden Inn 30% of the deals that we have signed year-to-date which is about 6600 – 6700 rooms in China which is back in consistent with last year but what's different about it is that 30% of its limited service and that's just Garden Inn. Now with the Hampton launch in and our relationship with Plateno, I think what you're going to see is tremendous opportunity for an uptick over time in the volume of what we're doing in China. I just think the complexion of it's going to be different and it is going to be reflective of what I think the bulk of the demand growth is going to be in that market. So that's a long winded but the point of it is really trying to be very strategic about the deployment of our brands around the world, right brands at the right time in the right markets.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joe Greff – JPMorgan: A couple quick questions on your 2015 outlook. One, of your 40,000 to 45,000 net-rooms growth how is that split between manage and franchise room? How is that split between U.S. and International? And then my follow-up is, a couple of quarters ago Chris, you had mentioned that you expect incentive management fees to grow next year, somewhere in the neighborhood of 20% plus. Is that still a fair view or conservative view given what is presumably a more rate driven RevPAR growth next year? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yes, Joe, I think on the first question it's 60:40 probably, probably 60% international openings, 55%, 60% the rest of U.S. next year and about the same management franchise. It is going to be probably five ticks off of an even split, one way or another and IMF, you know year-to-date we’re obviously doing really well. We do think that as we've been saying IMF is going to continue to tick up. So we obviously have not given it, we’re not giving guidance on segments or parts of segments from and EBITDA point of view at this call because we are in the budget process. I do expect that trends on IMF to continue to move upward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: I just wanted to ask about RevPAR growth and kind of the composition across some of the chains scales. This year we've seen a big rebound particularly in a second half of this year and some of the limited service a brand really outperforming, you guys are obviously very well-positioned for that. Can you help us think about the outlook for next year and some of the drivers that you think about the higher end parts of the chain scale versus what you are seeing and what you think is driving some of the outperformance and limited service?
Chris Nassetta: We have seen the limited service franchise growth particularly in July and August where we’re leading the charge and we’re quite strong. I think that has had to do with the fact that transient has been so strong. And I think in a number of those cases it's been sort of limited service has been catching up. I think as you look at – I think as we think about next year's growth I think it is going to be more balanced. I do have every expectation that those transient group are going to both remain very strong, but I would reason to guess that you are going to see a more balancing effect as the group business continues to pick up momentum and that's going to have a more dramatic impact on upscale to particular upper upscale that I think will drive greater growth there than you’ve seen this year.
Shaun Kelley – Bank of America Merrill Lynch: My follow-up would just be back to the unit growth. You talk about some of the mix in the portfolio there but just curious on what you’re hearing from developers as it relates to – is the interest pretty good for your brand it's coming from existing owners or is that coming from new developers or kind of what are you hearing right now from the development community because you guys are obviously very active there?
Chris Nassetta: I think what we’re hearing from the development community, it's little bit different as you travel around the world, the world is a big place. But I think it's generally quite positive. The mix of what we’re doing if you think about it sort of U.S. and everything else and the U.S. the majority of the deals we’re doing are with existing developers even with our new brands which is not surprising I would say, it's 75% plus or minus the last number I saw with existing owners which we love, I think it is reflective of the fact that they like our brands and our engines and we are driving great results by having very high market share. If you go to the rest the world by definition because it's a less mature business for us, those ratios aren't quite as high. I think it doesn't quite flip around but the majority of the deals we’re doing outside the U.S. are with new partners which is great just because we don't have as big a base out there and what I'm hearing and – I would say, again the world is a big place but generally the development community is quite positive. I would say in the U.S. incrementally more positive. The U.S. fundamentals continue to tick up. The economy is getting a bit better and so I think the development community is feeling better. I think in Europe again more recently I think there is a view that European economy is sort of stabilizing may be getting decent foundation to start the show a little bit more growth, not terribly robust growth but a little bit more growth. So I would say most recently developers have been getting more optimistic, not less. Middle East has remained optimistic is what I would say. Non-U.S., Americas I would say fairly consistently – consistent and remaining optimistic and Asia-Pacific is a big place, but broadly I would say there continues to be nice optimism there. As I said it's changing in different parts of the world. I think probably China being the most dramatic in my opinion, in a good way for us because I think we think it's the right thing to do. We've anticipated it. We've been working on this Plateno thing for the better part of a year and figuring out the limited service space with an intense focus for the last couple of years, but long winded answer but I would say from a quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year point to view I would say incrementally that development community if I average the world is slightly more upbeat.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent – Goldman Sachs: Two questions. First, just on the incentive fees which were strong, just a little bit more detail. Are more hotels now paying in the U.S. because they've met owners priority and is there some point where those will click on more? Or is it that you are seeing incentive fees go up because you are doing more international managed properties?
Chris Nassetta: It is more the latter than the former. If you look at the breakdown of our incentive management fees 75% of it is I think as Kevin said is international. If you look at the components of growth incentive management fees, 65% of the growth in the quarter was international so the majority of that and you know those do not generally sit behind owner return. So we had nice growth in U.S., don’t get me wrong, 35% of the overall incentive management fee growth was U.S. participations have moved up in the U.S., probably by about 10 points but it's still the minority of the growth. If you look at sort of what's organic growth, same-store growth versus new unit growth about 65% of it is coming from same-store. Again predominately international, strong International hotels and results [ph] in about 35% of it is coming from the new units almost all of which would be international in terms of new units that have instead of management fee contracts because most of the growth at that moment in the U.S. is franchise growth and limited service which wouldn't have incentive management fee contracts.
Steven Kent – Goldman Sachs: Chris, just to be clear, is there any point where there is a bogey they hit and they start to click on in a more material way and then just one secondary question which is the Hilton brand itself just lagged a little bit in RevPAR growth across all of your brands. Is it more international and that's what weighed that down? Is it harder to drive rate in the Hilton brand at this point? I mean still up 7.4% terrific number, but a little bit different from the rest of the--
Chris Nassetta: I think it was international assets and a couple in the lease portfolio in particular. I don't think there's anything anomalous to think about it, I think it's just this quarter leased.
Kevin Jacobs: There is more core, larger core Hilton's that are leased in some of the parts of the world where there is stuff going on and I don't think it is much more than that.
Chris Nassetta: In terms of the incentive management fees I think, I view it as a real positive which is again the bulk of our IMF and thus the bulk of our growth is in the international state. It's a linear equation in the sense that we don't sit behind perhaps, so as the markets around the world get stronger and we see profitability grow we get to share in our fair share of it without stepping up over the cliff. I mean we’re showing very good healthy growth year-to-date 24% IMF growth. We think we feel pretty good about that. We expect to have about 20% for the full year and as we have said many times we do think over time as we both see operating performance continue to improve around the world and we add a lot of new units with these types of contracts outside the U.S. that you are going to continue to see the IMF growth rate move up. But there are some to be specific in the U.S. where we don't have participation where the switch will go on but the U.S. is in aggregate only 25% of our overall incentive management fees.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis – Nomura: Just a quick question on the gains that you are still seeing in occupancy at this point and the cycle, they are surprisingly strong and Chris, if you could talk about how much more do you think is realistic to expect there and are we at the point where your managers can really start driving rate?
Chris Nassetta: That's a great question and we've spent a lot of time on it over the last year or so. I think obviously this year we would have, going into the year probably thought more of our growth would be in the form of rate than it has been. And I view it as a real positive that it's not in terms of sort of a telltale sign of where we’re in the cycle meaning mid-cycle with a long runway in front of us. And what's really happening is while we are driving rate, we’re – and while we are above prior high-level occupancy marks we’re continuing to just get smarter about the revenue management side of the business. I think as an industry but obviously I'm partial to us. I think we've been doing a good job and what that really has meant – I mean there are a lot of things but it's really looking at weekends particularly and off peak times. I think we've just gotten much, much better about driving business on Friday, Saturday, Sunday and if you think about it we always have capacity in most of our hotels because the bulk of our hotels are driven by the business side. So you always on Friday, Saturday, Sunday have capacity and if you can fill it even though you’re driving more occupancy in a rate you want to take it all day long at a reasonable rate because you’re just driving incremental profitability. And that's what's been happening, if I look at our occupancy numbers on weekends they've been moving up. If I look at our market share on weekends it's been moving up and that's what is sort of taking us over the prior peaks of occupancy that people have gotten used to thinking about. So I think it's in part because we've done a good job. I think it's sort of the new norm and I don't think we are done. I think next year we’re in the middle of budget season. So I don't have the answer in front of me but I can tell you directionally we’re definitely going to see more rate growth than occupancy – the mix is going to be more rate than occupancy then you saw this year. When we finish this year it's probably going to be 55 – 45 because of a phenomenon that I described. Again that's all on driving profitability and great for the business, I don't think it's something to worry about. I think it's something to revel in. Next year you'll see more of it but we will have some more occupancy because I still think there's more to do by being intelligent about weekends and sort of off peak times and how we revenue manage.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob LaFleur with JMP. Your line is open.
Bob LaFleur – JMP: A couple questions on the Waldorf transaction. As you looking to deploy number $2 billion obviously you're very a willing buyer. How do you manage your price discipline? What are you seeing in terms of cap rates or multiples for assets out there? And then a second Waldorf question unrelated, how disruptive are renovation do anticipate from the project after the new owners takeover? Are you going to close the hotel and start from scratch? Are you going to do in phases? Just give us a little bit of information on the if you don't mind?
Kevin Jacobs: Sure, I will give you what I can in terms of what we know at the moment. So you’re right $2 billion is a lot of money to put out there. Obviously I spend a lot of years of my life in that side of the business, so I think it's something we’re comfortable doing. I think yes, we’re willing buyer but thankfully we are part of the stage in the cycle where there are plenty of willing sellers. We are relatively unique and that we have $2 billion of cash that is going to get placed not, everybody is sitting around with $2 billion let alone all in cash. The way the 1031 rules work is you probably know we have a period of time after closing which to identify properties. We can identify two times the amount so we can identify $4 billion of properties to ultimately acquire half of that. That gives us the ability to put a lot in the funnel and decide based on quality and pricing and other considerations what we want to do. From a multiples point of view I will comment when we've done something but I think you can see sort of where things have been trading, that have occurred this year in the REIT world or private equity world and I think you can get a pretty good beat on where multiples are. In the end we sold the Waldorf at 32 times and I think we view the buy at something much closer to our own multiple which I think is – you can do the math, creates a huge arbitrage, meaning we’re going to take what was $61 million of EBITDA that the Waldorf reduced trailing 12 and it's going to turn into – I will let you do the math, it's going to turn into a lot more EBITDA than that if we do our job well and we fully intend to do so.
Chris Nassetta: In terms of renovation, it's unclear, we did a lot of work that we've talked about some of that on prior calls to understand the various options on how to redevelopment Waldorf. Anbang is a relationship that actually we've been building over the last year but the relationship in terms of their acquisition of the Waldorf was relatively recent and obviously we are all very busy getting the transaction negotiated. We have now entered the process with Anbang of sharing all of the various work that we've done in a more detailed way and I would say we will probably take the next six to nine months with them to review those alternatives that we've come up with and make sure we've sort of figured out what thoughts they have before we layout the exact plan for the Waldorf. So there is a lot of work being done but it's going to take, it's a major investment there making to buy it, it's another very significant investment, they are going to make to renovate. We all want to get it right so we’re going to spend the next six months or so making sure we pin it down properly.
Bob LaFleur – JMP: Okay and I'm going to count this is one question and then ask a follow-up, how effective did your system at capturing demand that you're not able to accommodate at a customer's first choice? Because as we talked about keep occupancies and lots (indiscernible) of sellouts, you’re are going to have customers that are looking to book in your hotels that cannot get into the first (indiscernible), how effectively you channel them through the rest of your system to capture them?
Chris Nassetta: I think we do a very good job. I always think we can do better, so our cross sell capabilities I think are quite good. I'm not sure anybody has any better but it is one of the things that I and we have focused on making sure that we get even better at that, that can also help drive system wide occupancy and ultimately system-wide RevPAR growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joel Simkins with Credit Suisse. Your line is open
Joel Simkins – Credit Suisse: In terms of your discussions with the rating agencies I just wanted to find out sort of how they are tracking and sort of with that in mind as you guys continue to delever. How do you think you can ultimately balance getting to low investment-grade with also starting to think about capital return strategy?
Kevin Jacobs: Moody's has just upgraded us one notch recently. So you can look at the press release they put out and the way we think about it is, we still think that 3 to 4 times is the right target leverage for the company. We think that will get us to investment grade. You could see points in cycle where they have a different view of what investment grade means if we get to three times leverage and we are not exactly investment grade we will evaluate it at that time. So we've been pretty consistent that that's our target and once we reach our target we won't overcook it and we will start thinking about the traditional forms of capital return.
Joel Simkins – Credit Suisse: Sure and then I'm just following up on the Waldorf obviously that was a very significant transaction, certainly highlights the other folks out there, willing to pay for iconic properties. With that in mind, I guess you still own some pretty significant big box hotels. Are you guys willing sellers if someone comes around for the right asset, the right price? Or are you going to continue to hold onto the big eight assets?
Chris Nassetta: I think as it relates to the big eight for the moment we’re going to hold onto those. I don't see anything like a Waldorf transaction in the offering. As we have talked about many times we’re not in love with the real estate for the sake of feeling like we have to own it. We’re really just trying to maximize value for the whole shareholder base. At the moment the Waldorf deal made a lot of sense for the reasons, I think I've articulated and that are obvious by the virtue of the math. I think the way to maximize the value of that other real estate at the moment given the condition specific to those assets is to keep inside the company. If at any point we think that is not the case we will be the first ones to want to do something about it as I'm pretty consistent saying likely option for that would be to do some sort of structured transaction to make sure that we’ve tax efficiency. The Waldorf, if we’re getting tax efficiency with a 1031. As was pointed out it's a lot of money to place, in theory, we’re accomplishing a lot of objectives including getting a massive reinvestment done without the use of our capital. That was sort of unique in the big eight portfolio. So I think the way to think about the real estate for us on a go forward basis and the bulk of those big eight is, if there was a time at which it made sense to bifurcate the business and that that would drive a greater value for the shareholder base we would be interested in doing that. As we look at it as I’ve said in the last couple of calls and we constantly are looking at this we just don't think that's the case at the moment. Net of cost break etcetera, we think that value equation is to keep the rest of it together.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Patrick Scholes – SunTrust: Two questions for you. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about six years of inventory in the timeshare business. How do you fill about – what is the right amount when I think about other companies it's typically you have 2 to 4 years, six seems definitely at the high end there. And then secondly public comments you care to make about the I think it's the United Nations enquiring about the Waldorf sale?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I will take them one at a time. On the six years of inventory you’re right, I mean that's more significant than what you would find with most of our competition and we like that. It makes us feel good that in a business that we are really converting to being heavily capital-light much like no tell a business that we've got a lot of running room which we think is testament to the strength of the brand and the testament to the business model which is to say by the virtue the fact we can build six years of inventory very quickly. This is a very sustainable business and business model. I think that the right range is generally somewhere in the 4 to 6 years, that’s how we would think about it. I think we are at the upper end of that. The higher the better, right. But 4 to 6 years is how we would look at that. As it relates to the inquiry on the Waldorf, I don't want to get into a lot of detail other than to say we actually went to the U.S. government as unilaterally as part of the announcement of the deal. We have had discussions which have been informal discussions and I'm confident as I said in my prepared remarks it will be able to close the transaction and the timeframes that have been previously disclosed.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley – UBS: Looking at the results RevPar growth was so strong. It was 150 – 200 basis points higher growth rate than you've had the last seven or eight quarters. But I'm just curious on the flow-through of the growth profit margin with that 150 to 200 basis points higher RevPAR, was that kind of the same level of growth profit margin growth. So just wondering if there's anything going on property level expenses or that kind of thing that maybe happened in the quarter?
Kevin Jacobs: No. I don't think so. I mean we actually tracked from a margin point – I mean there is always sort of nuances of what goes on both property and enterprise wide quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year comp issues that get complicated but I won't try and handle in a call and the limited time I have other than to say we felt great about the margins, actually, from a standpoint of how we came out at the property level and sort of the managed portfolio and how that translated into enterprise wide margin growth at 160 bps and 210 bps year-to-date. It all tracked frankly above what our expectations were. So I think best way to look at is where we are in margins year-to-date and where we’re in terms of our forecast for the year versus our initial that guidance and expectations and I think in all those regards we’re sort of trending a bit better than we thought.
Robin Farley – UBS: Okay. And then for the Canopy brand, are those 11 new builds or conversions and how do you expect over the longer term that that brand will be more likely to be developed?
Chris Nassetta: It is a mix of both. Interestingly, I think over time you will have a pretty even split. I would even guess the majority will be conversions or adaptive reuse, maybe conversions of independent hotels, it may be conversions of older office buildings or buildings that have character in a particular location. I would expect the majority would be made up of those types of transactions. As it turns out in the first 11, majority are actually new build opportunities. But I think that is just you’re dealing with a comp set of 11 hotels. I think it's going to be, as I said in my comments – what we've tried to do is engineer the DNA of this, so that either new build or conversion are very, very cost efficient to drive obviously brand integrity at the top that drives a lot of revenue but cost efficiency to build and to operate that will drive great owner return. So I think both ways, both new build and conversion it works, but I would think over time majority will be conversion.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.
David Loeb – Robert W. Baird: I want to beat the dead horse of the Waldorf just a little bit more on the 1031. Strategically, are you thinking about seeding Curio, Canopy or Conrad or Waldorf with the stuff that you buy and are you counting things that you buy and convert into the brand in your assumptions about new unit growth for next year?
Chris Nassetta: The answer is to number one, yes, to the extent we can seed any of our brands. So it's anything in the upper upscale and above so it's all of the ones you've noted plus others. Conrad, Waldorf, Hilton and Canopy and Curio, so anything we can do to increase the distribution of those brands is definitely at the forefront. And we have some opportunities to do that and the deals that are in the funnel that we’re working on – we also as I said have deals that are already in the system, not surprisingly that are terrific assets and great urban or resort destinations. We’re not counting – and the nug [ph] as we call it the net unit growth numbers that we gave you, we’re not counting those conversions.
David Loeb – Robert W. Baird: Okay. So just to follow-up in that kind of an indirect one--
Chris Nassetta: The nug [ph] numbers we’re giving you are really for managed franchise segment, our capital light segment. So this is trading assets within the ownership segment. So the 40 to 45 is pure management franchise.
David Loeb – Robert W. Baird: Okay. So sort of and a direct follow-up, Blackstone owns a bunch of hotels some of which are on the market. Do any of those like the Boulders or some of the Hilton's or Doubletree's that they own, are those able to be sold unencumbered of brand?
Chris Nassetta: Any of the ones we have with them?
David Loeb – Robert W. Baird: Yes.
Chris Nassetta: The answer is some are and some are not. Blackstone is probably if not the one of the top two or three owners of hotel real estate in the world and we happen to manage and franchise a bunch of hotels with them. So in terms of our consideration set of deals, Blackstone a number of their assets would definitely be in our funnel.
Operator: Your last question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen – Morgan Stanley: On your 2015 RevPar, can you give us any more color around your expectations for domestic versus international growth? Thanks.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, 5 to 7, I mean in an oversimplified way Thomas, I would say sort of U.S. towards the higher end. The rest of the world may be middle lower end of that range, and that’s how you get to a 5 to 7 range. We said another way, we think U.S. will lead the charge as it is this year. And the rest of the world will be a little bit lighter than U.S., not materially but a little bit.
Thomas Allen – Morgan Stanley: Okay. Similar to commentary from the other companies and then just my follow-up just on Plateno, I found it interesting that it is an exclusive license agreement. How is that typically structured? Do you’ve a lot of those deals? How do you think about doing those kinds of deals versus kind of going alone?
Chris Nassetta: We did not have a lot of them. We have some of them. I mean they take different forms but we do have what I would say sort of multi-asset franchise relationships, which is what this really is. This is a different in the sense I think the volume is going to be bigger than some others but we have some others that are sizable. And so it is not abnormal other than we think it's going to produce significantly higher results in the terms of the goal of doing 400 hotels. I don't think there's a better partner we spent, honestly the better part of two years, figuring out how we would go about really penetrating the 3 to 3.5 star space given my earlier comments. We think that is mission critical to success in China for a business in China and outbound business coming out of China. We considered lots of different options, and joint ventures and go it alone and finding a partner and one of this is just finding a good partner – Plateno, you know we start talking to frankly about year ago. We have been working on this a long time and given their track record and given the relationship we built with that we’ve very high degree of confidence in their ability to execute with us. We've done some amazing things with the design work with what we're going to do in the commercial set up, for what we are going to do with Hampton and I'm a 100% confident that doing it with them is going to accelerate our ability to penetrate the 3 – 3.5 Star versus doing it on our own by multiples.
Operator: Thank you. And with no further questions I would like to turn the conference over for any additional or closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Well thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time. We are obviously very happy with the results for the third quarter. We are excited about the momentum we have going into the fourth quarter more importantly, great momentum I think going into next year. Feel great about where we are in this cycle. Appreciate your time and attention today on a Friday and Halloween and look forward to catching up with you after we finish out the year. Take care and have a great weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Christian. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're pleased to report another quarter of great results, highlighted by strong topline revenue growth, fee growth and ownership segment performance, which led the results at the top end of our guidance range. We continue to feel very good about the macro set up for the remainder of the year and as a result, we've raised our full year adjusted EBITDA and EPS guidance. In the second quarter we exceeded the high-end of our guidance on system-wide comp RevPAR growth up 6.7% on a currency neutral basis, growth was driven by a 4% increase in average rate, a 2 percentage point increase in occupancy to 78%. Strong growth in transient demand combined with continued group performance delivered solid RevPAR growth for the quarter. Transient revenue grew over 7% system-wide. In the U.S. we saw particular strength with rack RevPAR in the quarter, up 14%. Government business also stabilized up over 3% year-over-year in the U.S. after five consecutive quarters of decline. Group revenue in the quarter was in line with expectations up 5% system-wide in the Americas and we continue to expect pickup in the back half of the year based on strong group revenue position, at both our Big 8 and a larger set of U.S. managed hotels. Our group revenue position for both the third and fourth quarter is up in the mid to high single digits. In Europe, strong group performance in the U.K., Italy and Portugal continue to drive positive momentum. As we look to the first half of 2015, we are seeing a similarly positive story with group revenue position up 8% across all U.S. full-service and luxury properties. Ancillary revenue growth continued as expected in the quarter with SMB at our owned and managed hotel on track to grow at roughly the same rate as RevPAR for the full year. We saw continued growth in group spend with ancillary revenues per group room up 14% in the quarter for the Big 8 and over 12% across all of our owned hotels in the Americas. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $651 million, an increase of over 10% from the second quarter of 2013 and at the upper end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points versus the second quarter of 2013. Now turning to development highlights, we maintained our number one ranking in key categories according to Smith Travel Research, including rooms under construction in every major region of the world, pipeline size and system-wide room. We continue to have great success in growing our system offer largest space of rooms in the industry. In the quarter we opened 56 hotels and over 8,000 rooms and 107 hotel and 17,000 rooms through Q2. As of quarter end, we had 694,000 rooms operating globally and with the opening of the Hilton Garden Inn Astana in Kazakhstan, we've increased our global presence to 93 countries and territories. In terms of rooms under construction, we had 540 -- 542 hotels and 106,000 rooms at quarter that will soon be added to our system, all of which are in our capital like management and franchise segment. This gives us an 18% share of all rooms under construction globally or approximately 4 times our share of existing supply. Our industry leading pipeline continues to grow, increasing by 18% over the 12 months ended June 30, now with 1,230 hotels and approximately 210,000 rooms in 75 countries and territories. For comparability, including all deals approved but not signed, our pipeline would have been over 230,000 rooms. In the second quarter, we approved 135-hotel with over 21,000 rooms for development. And what we believe will add significantly to our growth overtime. We recently launched our newest brand, Curio, a collection by Hilton. We believe that Curio will further enhance our ability to serve existing customers and attract new one through collection of unique four to five star hotel. For owners, affiliation with our commercial engines should drive significant market share premiums and distribution cost efficiency. For Hilton, we see a market opportunity of over 1,200 hotels globally and expect eventually to have hundreds of Curio’s in the portfolio. We expect our first Curio to open this fall. The developer response to Curio has been extraordinary. We've already reach agreement on nine properties comprising more than 4,100 rooms, including the SLS Las Vegas Hotel & Casino and a project in Doha, Qatar, and we have more than 75 Curio’s globally in various stages of discussion. Clearly, curio our 11th brand is off to a strong start and we are still on track to launch our 12th brand in a space we call accessible lifestyle by the end of the year. Owner interest continued to be very strong with this new brand as well. These new brands will add further momentum to the opening of fee paying rooms. We increased our system size in the quarter by over 7,000 net rooms, or over 15,000 net rooms in the first half of the year, all with the minimus amounts of capital investment by us and without any acquisitions. Brand strength is the key driver to our asset-light strategy. We continue to believe we have the strongest brand portfolio in the industry and our portfolio is getting even stronger as we grew our global RevPAR index 100 basis points year-over-year for the quarter, 70% of which was driven from rate. In fact, every one of our brands grew their global RevPAR index this quarter. Our leading brand strength is also evident in the annual J.D. Power 2014 North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Index study where Homewood and Hilton Garden Inn brands placed first in their segment. They are 11th and 10th wins respectively. Our brands have earned 34 first-place awards in 1999 significantly more than any multi-brand lodging company. Additionally, in the 2014 customer service Hall of Fame survey sponsored by USA Today, Hilton worldwide was voted the top-rated hotel company in the United States for customer service and the number two company in customer service across all industry survey. Technology is of course the key enabler of superior guest experiences and our guest expectations have been evolving very quickly in this area. Earlier this week we introduced the significant technological milestone for the company, one that is representative of our depth, talent and agility for the first time in the industry. Our guests can check-in using their Hilton managed account on a mobile device, tablet or computer and choose their exact room from digital floor plans before arriving at their hotel. Guests will also be able to customize their stay by purchasing upgrade, by making special request for items to be delivered to their room and even by checking out of the hotel, all using their personal technology devices. These capabilities will be available at U.S.-based Hilton worldwide properties across six of our brands by the end of this summer and by the end of 2014, guests at more than 4,000 properties in 80 plus countries can experience this new technology. Based on data and feedback from our customers, we know that they want this level of control over their travel experiences. Moving forward we will give guests even more choice and control with the ability to use their smartphones as a room key. We've spent the last few years testing and developing proprietary technology and we are pleased to announce that by the end of 2015 all U.S. hotels across four brands will have this capability, with the entire global portfolio of brands following soon thereafter. We believe this will revolutionize the hotel experience for our guests and will deliver significant return on investment for our owners as we execute this initiative at scale. Now let me update you on the outlook for the remainder of 2014. As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see very favorable conditions in the majority of our markets with uncertainty in some regions only moderately weighing an overall result. In U.S. we continue to expect moderate GDP growth coupled with historically low levels of supply to continue to drive very strong fundamentals. Given such favorable backdrop we are maintaining our high single-digit RevPAR growth expectations for 2014. For the Americas region outside the U.S., we expect continued growth in Mexico and South America to support high single-digit RevPAR increases for the full year 2014. Europe continues to benefit from strong group performance and steady transient gain, particularly as rebounding fundamentals in the southern region and easy year-over-year comparisons in Turkey offset softness in France. While we continue to monitor the ongoing uncertainty in Eastern Europe, our relatively limited exposure to the region should mitigate near-term risk. We remain confident in our mid single-digit European RevPAR growth expectations for the full year full year 2014. Moving on to the Middle East, Africa region, we expect geopolitical tensions to continue a way on travel demand. Our outlook largely assumes a steady-state and we anticipate flat RevPAR in the region for 2014 as a positive booking pace and easy comparisons in Egypt, some what mitigate challenges elsewhere in the region. Lastly Asia-Pacific continues to benefit from strength in Japan and China, with second quarter GDP growth in China of 7.5% coming in modestly above expectations and stimulus measures supporting Beijing's commitment to growth within this range. We’re confident that solid performance will continue to offset challenges such as weakness in Thailand leading to mid single-digit RevPAR growth for the overall region. Given strength in the Americas and APAC, and the continued rebound in Europe, we remain optimistic heading into the back half of the year. We’re confident that our award-winning brands and industry-leading commercial services platform will enable our global portfolio to deliver RevPAR in 5.5% to 7% range for the full year. Furthermore, we continue to forecast net unit growth of 5.5% to 6.5% in the management franchise segment equating to 35,000 to 40,000 rooms. In light of our positive outlook, we’re raising our adjust EBITDA to $2,425 billion to $2,475 billion, an increase of $10 million at the midpoint. Our diluted earnings per share guidance for the year increase to a range of $0.67 to $0.70 or an increase of $0.03 a share. In summary, we had an excellent quarter posting results at the top end of our guidance range and outperforming our primary competitors on the topline, margins, bottom-line and capital like net unit growth. We also continue to deploy free cash flow to prepay debt and build equity value with total prepayments $600 million year-to-date. We feel great about the fundamentals of the business and our positioning for the remainder of this year and for next year. Now, let me turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs. He will discuss the quarter's financial performance in a bit more detail.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the second quarter, which came in at the high-end of our expectations. For the second quarter 2014, diluted earnings per share totaled $0.21, ahead of our guidance of $0.18 to $0.20. Total management and franchise fees were $371 million in the second quarter, an increase of 14% over the second quarter of 2013, driven by both new units and topline growth. Franchise fees continued to perform strongly up 15% in the quarter. Given the strength to-date and our expectations for the remainder of the year, we’re increasing our comparable management franchise -- management and franchise fee growth estimates by 100 basis points to 11% to 13%. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $291 million was 8% higher year-over-year, adjusted for our non-comp increase in affiliate fees. This performance was driven by U.S. RevPAR growth for the segment of 6.4% and strong operating margin growth at owned hotels globally which grew nearly 150 basis points excluding non-comp affiliate fees. Our timeshare segment continues its transition to a more capital light business with third-party developed interval comprising 57% of sales in the quarter and representing about 82% of our total supply at quarter end. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $69 million was 15% better than prior year, driven by favorable transient rental and club revenue and margin growth, higher sales and marketing and G&A contribution and higher owned and fee-for-service sales Corporate expense and other was $80 million in the second quarter compared to $67 million in the prior year. The majority of this increase in net expense relates to incremental public company costs including stock compensation expense, which as we discussed last quarter are not evenly distributed throughout the year. We continued to expect growth for the segment of 3% to 5% for the full year. In terms of our regional performance, strong performance in the Americas was slightly muted by weakness in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand. In the U.S, continued economic strength drove comparable RevPAR growth of 7.3% with rate accounting for nearly two-thirds of the increase. We saw the strong growth despite the Easter shift which negatively affected growth by more than a point. U.S. focus service brand were particularly strong with 7.9% RevPAR growth in the quarter, up from 6.7% in Q1. We attribute these solid U.S. results to continued strong fundamentals and robust demand. Particularly in California and the Pacific Northwest where saw RevPAR increases of over 10%. Additionally, Florida benefited from both strong transient and group demand which drove RevPAR gains of nearly 12% and Boston performed well, especially over Marathon Weekend in April. U.S. owned hotels grew RevPAR 6.4%, boosted by strong performance in San Francisco and Hawaii. Conversely, our owned hotels in Chicago and New Orleans were adversely affected by softer group volumes given fewer city-wide in those markets. Our hotel in the Americas outside of the U.S. posted a very strong quarter with comparable year-over-year RevPAR up over 8%. Results were driven by strength in Mexico and Brazil. In Asia-Pacific, RevPAR increased nearly 5%, driven almost equally by occupancy and rate gains. Similar to Q1 results were boosted by strong performance at our hotel in Japan and Korea, where comp owned and operated RevPAR increased over 16%. Greater China grew RevPAR over 7% due in part the solid performance in Hong Kong. APAC results were tempered however by softness in Thailand and Singapore. In Europe, RevPAR increased 4.4% primarily due to increased occupancy, with the exception of strong performance at certain group hotels in the U.K., northern countries remained challenged throughout the quarter and France continued to struggle. However, rebounding fundamentals in the Southern and Mediterranean hotels largely offset these challenges. Athens for instance was up more than 18%. Portugal increased RevPAR an impressive 57% as its corporate meeting business saw robust growth. Additionally, we improved our RevPAR index by 170 basis points in Europe versus the second quarter of 2013. Finally, in the Middle East and Africa RevPAR declined 3.4% for the quarter as political strains, visa restrictions in Saudi Arabia and a resurgence of the MERS virus fear -- of MERS virus fears continued to negatively affect travel demand. Turning to our balance sheet, we continue to reduce our leverage, working towards our objective to achieve investment grade status by using substantially all of our free cash flow to prepay debt and in turn build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayments of $250 million on our term loan, with an additional payment of $150 million in July, which brought our total debt prepayments to $600 million year-to-date. As a result of continued strong performance, we're increasing our expected debt prepayment range by $100 billion to $800 million to $1 billion for the year. We also priced the second timeshare ABS transaction during the quarter, with the majority of the proceeds being used to repay our timeshare warehouse facility. We believe that the market reacted very well to the offering, which would significantly upside the $350 million and price that in all in fixed rate of 1.81%. In fact, the transaction price at the tightest weighted average pricing spread and the highest advance rate of any timeshare offering done since the financial crisis, which we think is another strong endorsement of the quality of our timeshare customer and platform. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $829 million, including $284 million of restricted cash and had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility. We also executed a successful secondary equity offering of $103.5 million shares during the quarter, generating a total of more than 2.3 billion of gross proceeds to Blackstone. For help in the offering have dual benefit of diversifying our shareholder base and increasing our flow, which roughly doubled as a result of the offering. Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are maintaining our system-wide RevPAR guidance of between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis. We're increasing our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, expecting a range of between $2,425 billion and $2.475 billion and EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.67 and $0.70 for the full year. As noted, we expect management franchise fees to increase between 11% and 13%. We are maintaining our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITA guidance of $315 million to $330 million and CapEx spending excluding timeshare inventory will total approximately $350 million, including about $250 million to $260 million hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. For the third quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $610 million and $630 million, and diluted EPS of $0.15 to 17% -- $0.17, sorry. Further detail on our second quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed this morning. This completes our prepared remarks and we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. So that we make speak to as many of you as possible we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Sally, could we have our first question please.
Operator: Thank you. (Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Shaun Kelley - Bank of America: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Shaun.
Shaun Kelley - Bank of America: I just want, Chris or Kevin, I just wanted to ask about the outlook for the back half year. So when we look at your 5.5% to 7%, that’s actually below what we are seeing for some of the peers out there and so I just want a little bit of color since you did come in at the high-end of everyone. I think across the global hotel peer set for the [C-Corp] (ph) for the second quarter? What are you guys seeing now, does that brand mix and group in terms of the outlook or do you think that just overall conservatism?
Chris Nassetta: No. I mean, I think, Shaun, good question, I mean, I think, if you look at our guidance for the full year, I believe we are at the midpoint the highest in the industry, which we think is reflective of our performance, which if you look at the last couple quarters and including second quarter numbers, we just gave you are beating the competition. So I think, we feel really good about the second half of the year. Transient business, as we discussed in Q2 is great. We see no reason why it’s not going to continue. I discussed -- I described sort of the group position in both the big hotels and the broader group of managed hotels in the back half, both third and fourth quarter being strong. So we feel good about the second half of your performance. And obviously, with our midpoint highest in the industry, we feel good about that. And obviously, our objective is try and -- it would be to try and outperform that and try and perform at the higher levels of what we’ve given you.
Shaun Kelley - Bank of America: All right. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Good morning, guys.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning, Joe.
Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Chris, you had mentioned that the pipeline increased 18% year-over-year and we actually saw nice sequential growth 2Q end versus 1Q end. Can you talk at a high level view what brands or geographies you're seeing incremental interest in and that represents either that year-over-year or sequential change? And then on the topic of my second question, my follow-up is on the topic of net rooms growth, which you guys outpaced both your large cap lodging Citicorp peers on. When you think about next year and you’re thinking about the pipeline build, and I'm not sure if you want to get into sort of guidance related question for 2015, but directionally it would be intuitive that your net rooms growth or your net room addition would accelerate. And I guess how are you just probably thinking about that at this point as well? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Happy to handle both. In terms of pipeline and where we are seeing the growth, I think it’s generally across the globe. We continue to have good to see great progress in all the major regions around the world. The U.S. has picked up probably as a percentage matter a little bit more than the rest of the world for us. That’s because the U.S. story right now is almost entirely a limited service story. We think we have the best limited service brands in the business that we’re getting far more than our fair share. I mean, we’re getting 20-plus percent of the deals and we’re 10% of the market. So, in terms of rooms under construction, so the U.S. has picked up a little bit more, but we talked about many times, the strategy is really with -- this great geographic distribution that we have and this great change scale distribution that we have is to really be strategic about how we deploy brands around the world, the right brands at the right time based on conditions in the market and customer demand. And so we are continuing to see broad pick up across the world and all the major regions. As I said little bit heavier percentage wise in the U.S. I think you're right and then I don't want to get into giving guidance for 2015 while I am sitting here in the middle of this year having just reported the second quarter. But I think your assumption is right, Joe, and that is to say, we’re having great success converting a pipeline into rooms under construction. We have more rooms under construction than anybody in the business and in every major region of the world, which I mentioned in my comments. Those rooms once they are under construction, obviously will highly likely to deliver. It’s very unusual once under construction that they would not deliver. So I think we still believe that last year was really the Nadir. We had a big pick up from last year this year sort of mid-4s to 6% or at the midpoint of our range in terms of net unit growth. And while I don’t have the exact number because this year is still playing out in terms of rooms we will get under construction, but it’s certainly our belief that that will continue to accelerate.
Joe Greff - JPMorgan: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank: Thank you and good morning. Just if I could ask a question on the owned hotel segment, obviously you guys will start to lap some easier occupancy and we have already been seeing rate contributing north of 60% of the RevPAR core growth in that segment. Obviously saw margins pick up a little bit within this segment this quarter, but how do you guys foresee the cadence through the back half of the year of margin acceleration within that segment specifically?
Chris Nassetta: I think if you look at the guidance for the full year which I think is as good as anything out there, we’re at a 150 basis points. We had a very strong margin growth in the first quarter because we were lapping some easier comps, but also we still had some of our ops effectiveness things rolling out. In this quarter, we were sort of on the higher end of the target of the range for the year. So by definition, we’re going to see margin growth more in line with the overall expectations for the year through the rest of the year. That’s not because anything is going wrong, it’s just that comps get harder as it relates to certain initiatives that we had going on in the hotel. So in the last couple of years, we’ve had outsized margin growth because we had some opportunities to do things quite efficiently that build a much stronger base to leverage off of in terms of our cost structure and now we're getting very healthy margin growth, I think industry-leading margin growth, but we will tamper into that this year into that 100 to 150 basis point range. So we feel very good about what's going on in the cost and the margin side as well as overall performance on the topline for the rest of the year. The big hotels have a -- will have an uptick from the second quarter in the second half of the year driven by group position, which is quite strong as I said. In the big hotels, group position in the third and fourth quarters in the high single-digits, low double-digits.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank: Okay. Thank you, Chris. And if I could just ask one follow-up. As you guys obviously think about your balance sheet and positioning of your balance sheet and think about the cash flow, obviously that you will be generating for debt paydown and obviously assuming an EBITDA growth next year on top of this year’s guidance, it looks if you will be somewhere in the mid-to-low 3 times leverage range by year end, next year. So I guess the question more or less is how do you think about your capital return strategy at that point in time? I know investment grade is the primary focus, but where do you feel you need to be to be comfortable there before you start kind of pursuing other measures of the capital returns?
Chris Nassetta: Great question. I that your math is directionally right, we are going to end this year based on the guidance we’ve given in the low-4s. If you fast forward and make some assumptions, you’re in the zone of being 3 to 4, which is our target. Our target is to get to a range where we can be a low grade, investment grade rating. And we do believe it’s in that range. Obviously the rating agencies will have a lot to say about that, but that’s based on a lot of work that we did as part of getting our initial ratings. And once we get to that sort of level of lower grade, investment grade our belief remains that we’re not in the business of hoarding capital. We are perfectly comfortable at that level of leverage that we have a balance sheet that is bulletproof and can deal with anything that might come at it. And so we would be very much looking at that point to take our free cash flow and give it back to shareholders. And the way we would do that, I would say at first we would probably to make sure that we can appeal to yield investors to have some dividend that would likely sink up with where our competitive set is and then whatever remaining cash flow is available after that. It would be very simple we would give it back to shareholders in the way we think that they wanted back and that would either be through buybacks or dividends. And I think we would make that judgment based on what our view is at the time that shareholders are looking for. We would be looking at the owners of the company. If we have excess cash flow, we think are entitled to get that cash back to way that they wanted. And as we I think have proven, we are able to perform at the top end of the industry both from a operating point of view, but also from a unit growth point of view without the need for a lot of capital. So we don’t see that changing. We do think that once we get through the deleveraging that we will have a significant amount of free cash flow to be able to return to investors.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank: Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: Thanks and good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Hey, Harry.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: Good morning. I had a broader question and then a more narrow question. The broader one is that, Chris, you’ve seen a number of lodging cycles. And as you look into 2015, what if anything versus say 2013 and into the first half of 2014, what if anything has changed that that you know that will continue to drive occupancy pricing margins forward? Are you more encouraged by any one or two factors?
Chris Nassetta: I think Harry the answer would be exactly what you and most everybody on the phone would expect. I think we are getting -- I do believe we’re sort of right at the mid cycle. We have very strong real-time indications that the things that you would typically experience at this part of the cycle are occurring. You're getting back to very high occupancy levels. You have an ability because of the return of group business to really start to get more aggressive on your mix of business and because of the overall strength in the transient business and return of group business, you're able to move rates up in an absolute sense. So I think 2015 is going to be another very, very good year simply because you’ve got a lot more business coming in the funnel to manage. You are going to get -- we are going to be able to be much more aggressive on mix. We are going to be able to be more aggressive on moving rates up and all of that’s going to be good for topline and all of that should flow through the bottom line should create a higher flow through situation. So we’re sitting here as we look to the rest of the year. Of course, as I already described feeling quite good and it’s too early to give guidance, so I am not going to do that, but the setup for next year feels terrific really, really strong.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: Very good. And then my follow-up question was on the Hilton brand, which from the topline perspective did lag the other brands. And just thought it would be useful to have you discuss what those -- what the factors maybe behind that, and is that an opportunity for you?
Chris Nassetta: I don't -- I mean having looked at it pretty carefully, I think the simple answer is just geography, specific geography of the brand. You can take out -- if we play around with it, take at sort of adjust for a few geographies and it’s right in mind with everybody else. And there we don’t believe there is any issue with it. I think you will see as those geographies sort of stabilize, you will see the Hilton brand back where it should be.
Kevin Jacobs: Yeah, Harry, the systemwide, that’s our revenue weighted, right. So the bigger hotels in a couple of the markets as I mentioned in my comments that had just softer citywide those drive more because they are bigger revenue hotels.
Chris Nassetta: Chicago in the quarter, those have a huge impact because they are really big hotels.
Kevin Jacobs: And we have some big hotels with a fair amount of revenue in the Middle East.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, Egypt, Saudi Arabia…
Kevin Jacobs: And that’s all historically because of the way business grew in those parts of world more Hilton.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: Great. That’s it from me. Thanks guys.
Chris Nassetta: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs: Hi. Good morning.
Chris Nassetta: Good morning.
Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs: Could you just talk a little bit about your real estate value maximization programs? Are some of the ideas you’ve talked about in the past, Hilton New York, in particular, and the Waldorf. I know, Hilton New York, you’ve made quite a bit of progress. Any commentary on Waldorf or any of the others?
Chris Nassetta: Yeah, we're making good progress in the things that we've talked with you guys about in the last couple of quarters. So we broke ground or I should say our partner Blackstone broke ground at the Hilton Hawaiian Village to start our newest timeshare tower. We’re in registration. We believe it will be actually selling units by the end of the year. So we’re often running and everything is progressing as planned at the Hilton New York. Terrific progress -- the design work for the retail platform. I think we’re in good shape to get that under construction early next year and get that in process in delivering EBITDA in the year next year because it can be done relatively quickly. On the timeshare at the New York Hilton again, quite good progress. We’re in for registration at the moment and believe we will obtain that registration by year end. We haven’t talked about it but we are way down the road in the process of getting incremental entitlement at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to do incremental timeshare in one or more of the towers. We do believe that long-term maximization of that asset, given it’s a very large hotel in a market that does not have enough airlift for a very large hotel is to convert one or more towers overtime to timeshare. We had to go through an entitlement process. We’re largely done with that. The reason we have not talked much about it is because we have other inventory that we’re selling in at that market. So it’s not going to occur in terms of getting into the conversion and sale. It will not occur in the short term because it doesn’t make sense at this exact moment. But over the intermediate term, over the next couple of years, we will move forward with that and we do believe there is a very significant value arbitrage on that. And then on the Waldorf, of course the big one, there is nothing new to report. We are making really good progress as we talked about last time. We have very good understanding of what the various uses to maximize the opportunity are. We have a very good understanding of the tax structuring opportunities to make sure that whatever we’re doing is maximizing the sort of after-tax value accretion benefits to shareholders. And we are now out officially, sort of, in a process. I’m trying to find a counterparty to make this all happen. It is still our objective that as I said on the last couple of calls, we’ll be able to weigh that all out in details by the end of the year and we’re making -- we’re making good progress against that.
Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs: Great. Thanks for the detail.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Chris, unlike your closest peers, you were able to grow RevPAR sequentially in the quarter. I’m just wondering, do you attribute that more to -- I mean, you talked about that in the highlights behind how you had quarter. But I mean, do you think that that is attributable more to geographic mix or RevPAR index gains?
Chris Nassetta: I think it’s more to do with RevPAR index gains. We had gains as I said over a 100 bps for the small system. Every single brand gained share. We have a bunch of different initiatives going on, on the revenue management side that have been very helpful, particularly in the limited service space where we’ve been deploying a whole new revenue management technology base. So I do believe it as almost everything to do. I mean -- let me put it this way. If you compare our RevPAR against one of our primary competitors, we overlapped pretty much perfectly and our performance was significantly better than theirs. So I think it is not -- that in and of itself, I think suggest it has a lot more to do with market share gains and things that we’re doing versus geography. We are very much of the belief that I have been shy about saying is that we have something reasonably unique which is we have very large scale, very large geographic diversification, very significant changed scale diversification and that you have great brand strategies, you connect those dots with great commercial strategies. We believe that it is a very powerful thing in terms of driving customer loyalty because we can serve all of customers’ need, no matter what they are wherever in world -- wherever they want to be in the world and they are able to stay loyal to us. Now obviously you’ve got a good brand, you’ve got good strategies on the revenue side but the makeup of what we have properly managed, I think, really does allow us to drive great results and hopefully our job. And we plan to continue to drive increasing market share premiums. By the way, those market share premiums then are the reasons why we can drive these huge pipeline numbers and rooms under construction and net unit growth because in the end, it’s all third-party capital. We’re not buying rooms. We’re not investing any major money. It’s third-party money that’s investing with us and investing with us because they're looking at these market share premiums. I'm describing and they're making the judgment that they are going to make more money by working with us than their other options.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: It’s really helpful. Thank you. And then just talk about your pipeline for a second, in light of your Curio and then the newest accessible lifestyle brand. Is there any way to help us think through when we look at your pipeline growth for 2016, how much of a driver those two new brands could be?
Chris Nassetta: Not yet. I mean, we try to give you a sense of what you know, obviously we’ve done in Curio to date and how many deals we have in motion. Curio is going to take off, I think, at a pretty good clip. Our lifestyle brand, their gestation period will be a little longer just because the -- it will be a little bit heavier proportion of new build and major renovation versus Curio which is almost immediate conversion opportunity of great independent hotels. So that will take a little bit longer. What I would -- we’re not giving guidance obviously. We talked about net unit growth. The way I think it all sort of boils down to expectations on -- what -- how many rooms are we going to deliver on an net basis into the system over time. As I said, we’ll give you in the next -- sometime before the year is out obviously a little bit more visibility in the next year when we haven't. But I do believe as I said I think to Joe’s question that last year was the natter and that net unit growth is going to continue to pick up and part of that pickup is going to be contributions from Curio in our lifestyle brand.
Felicia Hendrix - Barclays: Okay. Perfect, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Loeb with Baird. Your line is open.
David Loeb - Baird: Hi. Chris, first thanks for the very clear explanation of capital allocation strategy, that’s helpful. To follow-up on Curio in the lifestyle brand, can you talk a little bit about your willingness to commit capital and how much capital you think you might need in order to jumpstart those two brands?
Chris Nassetta: I think the answer is very simple, David and good question, limited de minimis amounts of capital. We don't view those brands as any different than any of the others in the sense that we will occasionally on a strategic deal make a minor contribution most typically, almost exclusively in the form of key money. We would look at those two brands, particularly as they get started in that same way. But I think when you look at the aggregate of what that means to take de minimis amount of capital. If you look at our entire pipeline, less than 5% by number of deals have had any contribution of key money. So that means more than 95% of the number of deals that we’re doing are what we would call dry deals. There's no investment from us. We think of these two brands as sort of a similar phenomena. We believe with the strength that I described of the overall system in our commercial engines that we have a lot to offer to owners and that we should not have to deploy our balance sheet to make these things happen in any material way.
David Loeb - Baird: So just a follow-up on that, would you consider lower franchise fees as an incentive for Curio in particular. Have you done some of that already?
Chris Nassetta: Well, I think all of us in the business on strategic deals will look at ramp-ups on franchises and things. And so yeah we would look at those particularly as new brands in that same way. But that’s pretty typical in the business and that’s very short-lived generally. I mean, it’s not long-term discounts. It’s basically sort of as hotels are coming into the system giving -- new or conversion giving them a chance to sort of ramp up. So we would consider that in some cases. Again we view that as an investment just like key money. So if we’re going to discount fees, we look at it relative to do we need to do it as a strategic deal on all of the same things we look at when we invest key money. One way or another, that’s an investment as well. And so on occasion, we will do that. Just as everybody has and just as we’ve done with other brands.
David Loeb - Baird: Great. Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Your line is open.
Robin Farley - UBS: Great. Thanks. I have one question and one follow-up. I guess, in the cycle, where would you say you start to get interested in monetizing real estate in the form of a potential REIT spinoff if we’re halfway through the cycle now or in the second half of the cycle, is this where you start to think about timing for that?\ And then my follow-up was really just clarifying, it sounded like in your opening remarks, that maybe there was slight lowering of guidance in the Asia-Pacific region. I think you said mid single-digit. That sounded like you were saying that through your full-year guidance for Asia-Pacific, which is just a tad low, I guess, in sort of, saying it would be the fastest growing RevPAR globally for you, which would have suggest kind of 7% or higher. So just want to clarify if that’s what the subtlety in guidance? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Sure, sure. Both good questions. On the real estate side, I believe that it came up on the last call as well. I think the way that we look at that is less to do with exactly where we are in the cycle and more to do with, just wanting to make sure whatever we do at the real estate that it’s a value creation exercise. As it relates to the bulk of our real estate given the tax attribute, the way that we would want to do any transaction is really to do in a tax efficient way. And that it would mean in the structured transaction either for all our large parts of it. And for us to do that factoring for the cost of doing it, the cost of duplicative G&A and those things, what we really would need to see is some diversions in multiple that would suggest that a bifurcation of the business in that way would create value. The reason we have not been rushing to do it is we have not seen those conditions. And so doing it now, we think would be treading water at best. Probably going underwater slightly because there are costs of doing it as they say and cost of duplicative G&A. So I think what we would be looking for has less to do with exactly where we are on the cycle, since we wouldn't really be taking these major assets and selling them out right because the friction in that would be too great. We look at more -- at any point in time, wherever we are in the cycle to relative valuations and multiple suggest that the separation of the business would -- that parts separated would be worth more than the pieces together. And at least the way, we look at it today, we just don’t see that. The APAC question is a great question and probably, we’re trying to be settled. We did probably bring the guidance down just a smidgen and had really to do with some of the things Kevin did reference relative to Thailand and Singapore being a little bit lighter. The core areas that drive our Asia-Pac business, which are Japan and China, we still feel good about that we’re going to have a great year in Japan, very high rep progress. And China, we still think we’re in the six to seven ranges is what we thought. But just because of some disruption that you’re seeing in Thailand and Singapore, being a little weaker, it is weighted the full year down a little bit to sort of mid or little bit better single-digit.
Robin Farley - UBS: Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: Yes.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Good morning, guys. Chris, back on, I think Steve questioned about the Waldorf. Have you reached a point or you can say it is more or less likely that you’ll execute a transaction where you can pull cash out of the Waldorf versus finding a partner to recapitalized the development or redevelopment? And second, can you maybe discuss what your priorities are there? I mean, I know you like to end up with the flagship hotel on a smaller footprint but are there other priorities such as cash or carried equity interest or even the timeshare of any that you put important are?
Chris Nassetta: I think, the priority starting maybe with the second and coming back to the first, both good question. I think, the priority for us in the end is to have a fully renovated reposition product on the full city block on Park Avenue that Waldorf Astoria represents. And as part of that a very high quality five Star minimum, I would say plus or minus 400 room Waldorf Astoria, that would be the flagship for the Waldorf Astoria brand. Now there are lot of different ways to look at the uses where that hotel could be bigger than that. There are many, I think that it could be smaller.  A lot of it has to do with honestly what various counterparties might want. From our point of view, if we end up with Waldorf at its size today, we can obviously, that would be very pleasing. We could have a smaller hotel and be quite satisfied with that. Getting timeshare use into it is an option. It is not necessarily a priority in terms of something that we have that done. We would love to get cash out of Waldorf. I think the more likely efficient way of maximizing the value of the Waldorf is not going to involve getting a lot of cash out. I think its going to be trying to get a great value for the Waldorf, get the capital put in by third-party. And in some way either doing it a joint venture where we continue to have an ownership, maybe a major ownership stake in the hotel or using in some way the proceeds of that to trade in the other real estate on an efficient basis. We have not gotten to the bottom of all that because we’re out in the world of counterparty, trying to figure out how third parties are going to look at it. But the reason that that is not highly likely that there is huge amount of cash to come out of it, isn’t that there is not a huge manner value, there is. I’m not going to give you, because I don’t know it yet but its worth a lot more than what the multiple time EBITDA is. It’s that we want to do that on a very tax efficient basis. And I think you as the shareholder base should want us to do that as well, because there will be a lot of friction in the Waldorf. It was acquired in I think 1949, so you going to imagine it does not have a significant amount of basis. The good news is, it has a huge amount of value and there are some very efficient ways in the world of real estate to be able to capture that value and effectively take advantage of that without ultimately having on a friction. Exactly how we’re going to do that. I'm not being quite. We don't know. We know the various options, which prototypical would sort to be either JV structure or a 1031 structure. We just have to sort of finish the process on the counterparty side to be able to judge, which direction it’s going to go.
Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Smedes Rose with Evercore. Your line is open.
Smedes Rose - Evercore: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to your big eight hotels, could you just maybe remind us kind of where they were in the last peak in terms of the percentage of group mix and where they are now? And kind of I know you don't want to talk about 2015 too much, but, I mean, is it fair to assume that the group will continue to strengthen there into next year, is that what you’re seeing on pace now or maybe just a little more color around that?
Kevin Jacobs:  Yeah. Smedes, in terms of where they are versus the last cycle, they are actually about where they were before, but that doesn't mean we don't think that we can layer groups in more effectively as group demand strengthens to increase it. So I think we’ve said publicly in the past that the target there is sort of 40% and they are in the high 30s. So if we are successful as demand strengthens in the top of the funnel fills and layering groups into non-peak periods, we ought to be able to continue to drive it a little bit higher.
Chris Nassetta: And I think just and it’s implied in what Kevin said, this quality of group is also taking the groups that are lower rated, lower quality groups and lower -- importantly lower spend groups that were sort of filler in a more challenging group environment and replacing them with higher quality, higher paying groups that spend more and have a lot more ancillary spend. So there is plenty of upside in sort of the transition of group going forward.
Smedes Rose - Evercore: All right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley: Hey, guys, good morning. So there is some hope that incentive management fee is close to inflection point here. Your IMF increased 15% this quarter, 17% last quarter. How should we think about the trajectory going forward? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: I think the trajectory sort of what we saw in the quarter is sort of the full year trajectory, probably would have been a little bit closer to the first quarter trajectory. But for what's going on in the Middle East, we have a handful of incentive management fee contracts that are pretty lucrative there and in Middle East we’ve got a few issues as you can read going on. So it weighted it down a little bit. But we feel great about that trajectory. I mean, notably if you look at our IMF, which I think is a little bit different, 80% of our overall IMF is outside the U. S., only 20% is inside the U.S. And why does that matter? It matters because the structure of incentive management fees outside the U.S. is different. It’s a much lower rate of structure. We don't sit behind a press the owners like sort of traditional approach inside the U.S. So, you’re going to continue to see a good -- I think this year is going to be fine sort of in the mid-teams or maybe inching up a little past that. But as we get into the next couple years, both because of improvement in performance, but importantly because the majority of the pipeline is international. Majority of those have incentive management fees because there are full service and they have these incentive management fees that don’t sit behind priorities. At those continues to enter the system, you’re going to see incentive management fee growth going to the 20-plus percent range over the next couple years. So we feel good about this year trajectory, feel very good about.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley: Thank you. And this is my follow-up. As you gave some good detail on the Waldorf, I think I’ll just try and push it a little more. Do you know the approximate square footage of the room base? Just trying to think if you were to lower the room count from 1,413 now to 400 to 500, how much saleable square feet would there be for other stuff? Thanks.
Chris Nassetta: Yeah. Thomas, it’s a 1.6 million square foot building, so it really can vary quite a bit depending on how counterparty would want to break it up between residential and hotel. So the overall square footage is about 1.6 million.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley: Great. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Nassetta, I’ll turn the call back over to you.
Chris Nassetta: Great. Thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time here on a Friday in the middle of summer. We’ll try and find a better day, but as a new public company, Friday seemed to be the only day that we could get. We are going to do a little bit next year. Anyway, we’re very pleased as I think you could tell with both the second quarter results, but more importantly, how we feel about the second half of next year and how we feel about the broader setup going in the next year. We will look forward to catch it up with you after third quarter and I hope everybody enjoys the rest of your summer.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning, and welcome to Hilton Worldwide Holdings First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Christian Charnaux, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, Mr. Charnaux.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Sharon. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide first quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, we'd like remind you that our discussion this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning, Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the outlook for the remainder of 2014. Kevin Jacobs, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Thanks, Christian, and good morning, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. Disciplined execution are the core strategies that we discussed on our last call and a clear focus on delivering long-term value for shareholders has resulted in another great quarter for the company. Strong top line revenue growth, flow-through and timeshare performance led to results that significantly exceeded our expectation. And as a result, we've raised our RevPAR, EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Clearly, we continue to feel really good about the fundamentals of the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll spend a few minutes talking about that in just a bit. First, let's talk more specifically about the first quarter results. Our system-wide comp RevPAR growth for the quarter was 6.6% on a currency neutral basis, driven by a 3.6% increase in average rate and a 1.9 percentage point increase in occupancy. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in both the group and transient segments. In fact, for the first time in many quarters, system-wide group revenue growth in Q1 outpaced transient revenue growth. Consistent with our view that we're at the midpoint of the cycle, group business continues to build with system-wide group revenue growth in the quarter of 7.4% year-over-year. We're also starting to see meaningful increases in group ancillary spend, especially food and beverage. Banqueting revenue was up over 12% in our U.S. owned and managed hotels. And in our Big 8 hotels, group F&B spend per occupied room was up nearly 30% in the quarter and 13% in our U.S.-owned and managed hotels. This helped drive an overall increase in food and beverage revenue of almost 10% over the same time period in our U.S. owned and managed hotels. Transient revenue growth remained strong as well, up over 6% across the system at comp hotels. This continued growth in transient demand, combined with strengthening group business, led to accelerating RevPAR growth for the quarter. Weather in the U.S. and the U.K. marginally affected Q1 RevPAR growth. However, this was largely offset by the timing of Easter. Our strong top line performance, combined with our disciplined approach to managing costs, led to strong improvement in operating margins in the quarter. Our U.S. owned and operated hotels grew operating margins 157 basis points year-over-year, and our owned and operated hotels outside the U.S. grew operating margins 191 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This operating margin performance in our hotels, combined with overall management and franchise fee growth of over 17%, strong growth in timeshare EBITDA and continued corporate cost discipline led to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $544 million, an increase of 22% over the first quarter of 2013, and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 400 basis points versus first quarter of 2013. We also continued to make great progress on mining value enhancement opportunities embedded in our own portfolio, such as the new timeshare tower at the Hilton Hawaiian Village that we announced last quarter. At the Hilton New York, we're planning a complete repositioning of the Sixth Avenue frontage of the property, which will create a retail platform with over 10,000 square feet of prime street-level space out of what today is a portico [ph] share. We expect construction of the retail platform to commence by the end of the year for completion in the first half of 2015. We also plan to add additional timeshare inventory to the property, including 2 floors plus some unused penthouse space. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect interval sales to begin in the second half of the year, with units complete in the first half of 2015. We will fund both projects within the range of our CapEx guidance and expect steady-state incremental $6 million in annual EBITDA from the retail platform and a combined incremental NPV of the retail and timeshare projects of approximately $165 million. Turning to some development highlights. As evidenced by the opening of over 9,000 rooms in the quarter, we continue to have great success in growing our system off the largest base of rooms, now with more than 686,000 rooms operating globally in 92 countries and territories. We have also approved 107 hotels, with over 15,000 rooms for development in the first quarter. We continue to be #1 in rooms under construction in every major region of the world, according to Smith Travel Research, with over an 18% share of all of rooms under construction globally. Today, we have 510 hotels and approximately 101,000 rooms under construction that will soon be added to our system. We have also maintained our #1 pipeline ranking according to STR, with 1,165 hotels and approximately 200,000 rooms in 76 countries and territories. On a rooms basis, we have increased our pipeline by 13% over the last 12 months. One signing I'd like to highlight is the new Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills, which is adjacent to the Beverly Hilton on the corner of Wilshire and Santa Monica Boulevard. This 170-room luxury hotel will be the brand's first newbuild hotel in the West Coast. Our luxury brands continue their industry-leading growth with stunning purpose-built properties in marquee locations, such as the recently opened Waldorf Astoria Beijing, the Waldorf Astoria Amsterdam, the Conrad in Dubai, and the Waldorf Astoria in Jerusalem. Most importantly, we continue to outpace our primary competitors in opening fee-paying rooms, increasing our system size in the quarter by 8,000 net rooms. It's important to note that we continue to achieve this high level of growth with de minimis amounts of capital investment by us and without any acquisitions. Our capital-light premium growth is built on the strength of our brands, and we firmly believe that we have industry-leading brands that are a meaningful strategic advantage. Our portfolio of brands is diverse enough to meet most customers and owners' needs in most regions, but we're always looking to enhance our ability to serve customers and owners globally. That, on occasion, includes creating new brands, and we are hard at work preparing to launch 2 new brands later this year. Our existing portfolio of industry-leading brands continues to outperform. The key stat we focus on: the measured brand strength, system-wide comp RevPAR index grew nearly 50 basis points year-over-year for the quarter. Each year, thousands of consumer brands are rated by over 5,000 entrepreneurs and readers of Entrepreneur Magazine, resulting in a list of the top 120 most trusted brands. I'm pleased to share that 6 of our brands have been named on Entrepreneur's list. Hilton Worldwide has more brands appearing on this highly influential list than any other hotel company. Now let me spend 1 minute and update you on the remainder of 2014. Looking forward, our group booking position for the remainder of the year is very strong, with meaningful increases in both volume and rate. Our 2014 group revenue position had our Big 8 hotels and the larger group of U.S. managed hotels is up in the high-single-digits compared to the same time last year. Corporate meetings, our highest-rated group segment, is outperforming previous full year revenue position by 12% in U.S. owned and managed. As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see generally improving conditions and are very optimistic for the remainder of 2014. In the U.S., we continue to expect strong fundamentals with reasonable GDP growth driving demand that we expect to be paired with muted supply growth for some time to come. This should result in modestly better RevPAR growth than last year. The Asia-Pacific region should continue to lead RevPAR growth globally, with significant growth in Japan, driven by the ongoing effects of their easing monetary policy and strong and stable RevPAR growth in China in the 6% to 7% range, overcoming some regional weakness in Thailand. In Europe, we continue to see improving performance and expect continued strong RevPAR growth led by the U.K. and Turkey, both areas where we have a large presence, compensating for relative sluggishness in France. Overall, we continue to expect Europe RevPAR growth to be up to the mid-single-digits for the full year of 2014. In the Middle East and Africa region, continued weakness in Egypt and slower growth in the Arabia -- Arabian peninsula and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will weigh on results a bit, which is being mitigated by very solid growth in Africa. As a result of these positive regional dynamics, we continue to be very optimistic for the remainder of the year. Therefore, we're raising the lower end of our full year comp RevPAR guidance 50 basis points, so they'll now be 5.5% to 7%. Our guidance for diluted earnings per share for the year is increasing to between $0.64 and $0.67, and our guidance for adjusted EBITDA is increasing to $2.415 billion to $2.465 billion. As a result, the new midpoint of our full year 2014 adjusted EBITDA guidance is above the top end of our previous guidance. We continue to expect net unit growth of 35,000 to 40,000 rooms to our managed and franchised segment, which would represent 5.5% to 6.5% unit growth in that segment. In closing, we had a very strong quarter, beating our EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance and outperforming on the top line, margins, bottom line and net unit growth. We continue to execute on value enhancement opportunities in our real estate portfolio and to aggressively deploy free cash flow to prepay debt and build equity value. We feel great about the fundamentals of the business and the set up for the remainder of the year. I will now turn it over to Kevin Jacobs, our CFO, who will discuss the quarter's financial performance in a bit more detail. Kevin?
Kevin J. Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. As Chris mentioned, we are very pleased with our results for the first quarter, which exceeded our expectations. For the first quarter of 2014, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, totaled $0.13, ahead of our guidance of $0.08 to $0.10. Special items that have been adjusted in our first quarter results are related to share-based compensation expenses in connection with our IPO last December. Total management and franchise fees were $331 million in the first quarter, an increase of 17% over the first quarter of 2013, driven by top line growth, new units and non-comp base fees. Franchise fees, in particular, exceeded our expectations, largely due to strong performance among our focused-service hotels in the United States. As new units enter the system and existing contracts roll over to our published franchise rates, our system-wide effective franchise rate continues to increase, now at 4.6% for the quarter. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2014 of $179 million was 13% higher year-over-year, adjusted for a onetime gain on a lease we were bought out of in the first quarter of last year and a non-comp increase in affiliate fees. This performance was driven by segment adjusted EBITDA margin growth of 172 basis points adjusted on the same basis, as well as comparable year-over-year RevPAR growth of 5.1%. Our timeshare segment first quarter EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA, excuse me, of $85 million was 44% better than the prior year, driven by transient rental, lower corporate support costs, favorable timing from the recognition of revenue and favorable adjustments in expected sale prices. Although a portion of this performance benefited from favorable timing, the segment results this quarter speak to the underlying strength of our timeshare business. Corporate expense and other totaled $51 million in the first quarter compared to $68 million in the prior year. This decline was largely driven by a onetime credit of $18 million related to the conversion of our cash-based long-term incentive program into a stock-based program. This credit will reverse itself over the balance of the year and was built into our previous guidance. The expenses associated with our new share-based compensation program flow through our G&A expenses and are included in our adjusted EBITDA. In terms of our regional performance, in the U.S., continued economic recovery drove comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of 6.5%, and comparable U.S. owned and operated hotels were up 6%. Great performance in rack rated business, with revenue in the quarter up 11%, and U.S. corporate transient business up 6.2% for the quarter and over 12% for the month of March year-over-year, contributed to strong growth in transient business. The Los Angeles and Florida markets had a strong quarter with RevPAR growth of 10% and over 8% respectively. San Francisco and Hawaii also remained strong markets for us, largely driven by strong transient demand. The New York market softened, with increased supply in weather impacting transient demand. Chicago and Washington, D.C. were also soft, driven by rate pressures and also weather. Our hotels in the Americas outside of the U.S. has a very strong quarter with comparable year-over-year RevPAR up 12% for owned and operated hotels, driven by strength in Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Jamaica. In the Middle East and Africa, comparable currency neutral RevPAR declined less than 1% for the quarter, with continued political unrest in Egypt and weakness on the Arabian Peninsula offset by strong performance in our African hotels. In the Asia-Pacific region, we continue to outperform, with strong demand in Japan and China driving comparable currency-neutral RevPAR growth of 8.7% for the quarter, primarily driven by rate. Japan, where we have a significant presence, continues to be extremely strong, growing RevPAR by over 25% in the quarter, while Greater China grew 7.5%. Finally, in Europe, we had a very strong quarter, with comparable RevPAR growth up 6.5%, driven equally by occupancy and rate. We increased our market share premiums by 140 basis points and saw strength across all segments, with group revenue increases in Europe of 17% in the quarter, driven by company meetings and conventions. RAC [ph] revenue growth of 7% and corporate revenue growth of over 11% also contributed to the European strength. Regional strength in the U.K. and Turkey, as well as key markets in Continental Europe compensated for a weak France. Turning to our balance sheet. We continued to reduce our leverage, working towards our objective to achieve investment-grade status by using substantially all of our fee cash flow to prepay debt and in turn, build equity value for our shareholders. In the quarter, we made voluntary prepayments totaling $200 million on our term loan. And in fact today, we are making another $100 million repayment on that loan. Also per the terms of our debt agreements, we further reduced our term loan interest rate by 25 basis points by achieving certain leverage thresholds. Along with the 25 basis points reduction we achieved at the completion of our IPO, we have now reduced the rate on this loan by a total of 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 250 basis points. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents at $722 million, including $287 million of restricted cash. And we had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolving credit facility. Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we are increasing our system-wide RevPAR guidance, expecting an increase of between 5.5% and 7% on a comparable currency-neutral basis with 60% to 70% of that growth expected to be driven by rate. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis. We are also increasing our guidance for full year adjusted EBITDA and diluted EPS, expecting a range of between $2.415 billion and $2.465 billion and EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.64 and $0.67 for the full year. We continue to expect management and franchise fees to increase between 10% and 12% for the year. We are increasing our full year timeshare segment adjusted EBITDA guidance to $315 million to $330 million for the year and CapEx spending, excluding timeshare inventory, will total approximately $350 million, which includes about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation and still expect to prepay $700 million to $900 million in debt for the year, devoting substantially all of our free cash flow to building equity value. We expect corporate expense and other to increase between 3% and 5%, which includes incremental public company costs. For the second quarter of 2014, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis, as we benefit from strong seasonal occupancy and further room rate improvement. We expect second quarter diluted EPS adjusted for special items will total $0.18 to $0.20. We expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA of between $635 million and $655 million. Further detail on our first quarter results and updated guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks, and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Sharon, can we have our first question, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Harry Curtis from Nomura.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Those are really strong results for the first of the year. And I'm wondering, Chris, you talked about them continuing into the second half. What kind of data do you have that might give you confidence that the strength actually should last further into 2015?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. Great question. And I think I said a couple times, we remain very optimistic because I think we do, and I do, and that is really based on, I mean, look at the overall business and the biggest segments, transient strength that we saw in the first quarter, that we continue to see in the second quarter. And based on everything we see, sort of going on economically in our biggest markets, we think will continue and that's matched with significant upticks and what -- in the group's phases. I mentioned in my prepared comments, for the first quarter in a long time, we saw system-wide group revenues growing faster than transient. Not that transient was bad. Transient were quite good. It's just group is picking up steam, which gives us confidence. If you look at our big hotels in the second half of the year, they're up nearly 20% in terms of position on the group side so it gives us a great deal of confidence. Along with the fact that we are starting to see, in part because of where we are in the cycle, in part because of some real hard work that our sales force is doing, we're starting to see the benefits of the ancillary spend focus and increases there. So it feels like the business is really hitting on all cylinders and sort of playing out the way we had thought it would. And we great about what's going to play out the rest of the year. Obviously, we hope we will and think we will continue to outperform.
Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division: Okay, and then -- that's great. And the second question is on the call, you mentioned you've got 2 new brands coming. Can you talk about what segment of the market they'll address and do you need much CapEx to launch the brands?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. On the first -- let me be clear, because I know a lot people asked that question. We do not think we need any real care [ph] . We don't intend to build in any of our new brands, any of this, on our balance sheet. We have a terrific group of owners, 10,000 owner relationships around the world, that are dying to do more with us because I think they believe in the strength of our brands and the market share of our brands and we're driving great profitability for them. And so in the 2 brands that I will briefly describe that we're working, we do not intend to do any of the building on our -- on our balance sheet and we do think we will be able to grow these at a very nice clip. The 2 brands are -- first, the one that will probably come first, I'd describe as a brand that will be a 4-plus-star brand that will aggregate iconic urban and resort hotels that don't really fit in the box of the specified standards of any of our other brands. What we find is increasingly, some of our existing customers, as well as other customers that we want to attain, are interested in those types of locations and staying in these kind of unique iconic hotels, and we think we can better serve our customers by offering that type of product. It often offers us a great way to serve them better, but also grow the company at a faster pace because not only will it not require CapEx, but it is very conversion-friendly as a brand. The second brand, which we've talked a lot about, is Lifestyle. And we -- I think, by the way, the first brand is probably is to launch sometime in the summer. The Lifestyle brand, we're way down the road on probably more in the fall. We are currently working on deals by the way, in both brands. And Lifestyle brand, which we'll talk a lot more about in the next call or 2, and give you a great amount of detail, our approach there is a little bit different than some of our competitors. Most of the competition has sort of accessed lifestyle at a luxury price point; we believe that there's a much broader base of demand at the upper end of upper upscale. And so we sort of are coining the phrase, "accessible lifestyle" from a price point of view. And we think that being at that price point and a product and service delivery that matches with that is going to allow us to serve more customers better and build a brand that is much bigger than what we've seen others be able to do. It also, by the nature of what it is, will incorporate newbuilds, none of ours, on our balance sheet, but will be very conversion-friendly. So I think these are going to be able to incrementally add significantly to the growth of the company long-term as well as short-term. Neither will have a particularly meaningful impact on this year's net unit growth, just given the sequence of when they're being launched, might have a little bit of impact, but not significant impact. But we'll start to have some good impacts starting next year.
Operator: Your next question comes from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: I have 2 questions. First, I just wanted to touch on some of the New York impact that you guys are seeing, clearly not manifesting in the numbers here. But have the market-wide New York results given you guys any pause with respect to your guidance, as you look towards the back half of this year?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No. I mean, New York -- New York was impacted in the first quarter, and pretty soft, I'd say. It's really impacted by 3 things. One that a lot of people have talked about is supply. New York does have more supply than, frankly, any of the other major markets. But that was compounded, and I think what was more impactful was the year-over-year impact on the Superstorm Sandy business and then weather, of course, we're at the northeast corridor, but New York was particularly hard hit. So we think New York was softer we think in the first quarter than it will be for the remainder of the year. But it will probably, as a result of some of the supply issues, be a little bit softer overall than some of the other markets that are growing faster in the U.S. Long term, we think New York is going to be fantastic as it always is. The demand levels are growing and we think, over time, very easily absorb this new supply. And to get to the specific answer, we do not -- it doesn't -- I mean, we have factored that into all of our thinking in terms of our guidance. And we do not see a meaningful risk related to New York and the guidance we're giving you.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division: And then just one follow-up. If you, obviously, look at where you guided 1Q and what you ultimately delivered in the 1Q, and I know some of which was trucked up to timing and some corporate expense. But when you think about the back half of the year and the raise of overall guidance, it looks as though there could be a bit of conservatism in there. Is there anything that I could potentially be missing?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, I think you got it right. We essentially flow through the beat for the first quarter in the increase in our guidance. We were -- we beat the midpoint by about $53 million. We increased guidance, the midpoint, by $40 million. Plus or minus $13 million of that was sort of timing within the year. So we flow through the full amount of the beat that wasn't timing, which we feel comfortable with. And that implies, as you've suggested, that we maintain the rest of the year. We feel comfortable that frankly, there probably is a bit of conservatism built into that. We would certainly hope we would do better.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: So first is a follow-up on your comment about the second brand that you may launch this summer, is that more of kind of a subtitle where you're just kind of putting hotels that are not currently in your system in there, rather than actually any sort of rebranding of those hotels or managing those hotels?
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, it is -- it is -- let's not say there -- that there may be opportunities to rebrand parts of our portfolio, but I think that is -- that would be very modest. Both the brands are focused on new units that are not in the system. So again, there may be very small amounts of things that can move around over time. But the deals that we are working on, and we are working on a meaningful number of deals in both new brands, are new units outside of our system. Some newbuilds, particularly with Lifestyle, but a significant number of conversions.
Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division: And then for my second question just looking at the guidance raise, how EBITDA's raised more than the RevPAR's raised and fee growth is unchanged, but EBITDA up. Is that -- what's been primarily the driver there? Is it some kind of owned property margins, or what should we think as the biggest trends?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, it's a little bit of flow-through. Basically, margin's better all around, a little bit of revenue, a little bit of margin, little bit of time share.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Right. And some in fees, Robin, obviously the fee...
Christopher J. Nassetta: There are some in fees...
Kevin J. Jacobs: The 10% to 12% is a wide range in fees, right? So we feel better about fees, but not quite better enough just yet to raise it to 11% to 13%.
Operator: Your next question comes from Steven Kent from Goldman Sachs.
Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division: A couple of questions. First, on timeshare, the sales were up 13%, very strong in the first quarter. Can you just give us a sense for how much of those are coming from your asset-light strategy, and how much more growth opportunities do you have there? And then the G&A costs even after adjusting for onetime benefits, they were lower than we were forecasting. And I think you've done a very good job on there. Can you just give us a sense for where that goes over the next couple of years? Does it -- does G&A flatten out? Or does it have to grow as you increase some of these brands, the number of brands?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Sure. On the first, I think it's simple. In the first quarter, we were a little less than 60% of our sales were in the asset-light. If you look at all of 2013, I think we're around 50%. So it ticked up in the first quarter. It will bounce around a little bit depending on what inventory's getting sold when. But if you just look at the trajectory, 80% of the existing inventory, which is roughly 5 years of inventory that we have is capital-light. So over time, that number should be growing. Naturally, as a result of most of our inventory -- the majority of our inventory being capital-light inventory. On the G&A side, thank you for your comment. Yes, we -- we're actually quite proud of the fact that we're very efficient in the G&A side of things. I think part of what even netting out for the comp stuff that you're seeing is there are some timing things going on in the first quarter that allowed it to be even better than what you might have been forecasting. Some of those things, obviously as the year plays out, will reverse themselves and occur in different quarters. Having said that, we, as I said, are very proud of the fact that we are very focused, very lean and mean in terms of our cost structure. We are not going to lose our cost discipline. As Kevin described, we said we'd have a 3% to 5% increase in G&A and other year-over-year. That's incorporating public company costs. Our objective would be to be in that same sort of range. Next year, they're even including the incremental step up in public company costs. So we do have, as you know being public, requires certain cost structures in the accounting and the legal and tax as well as having public company compensation, which in our case is flowing through and impacting is being taken out of our EBITDA. So when you factor for those things, we will have some increases, but we believe are very modest increases.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Crow from Raymond James.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: It really was a good quarter, so it might be a little bit nitpicking here. But as I look at owned hotel RevPAR growth of 5.7% and I look at owned hotel revenue growth of 3%-ish. You got some FX drag, and from what we gather, maybe the joint venture hotels delivered very good results, which did not flow through to revenue in that line item. But my question is what, do the Big 8 hotels do in the quarter? You mentioned the food and beverage and outside-the-room spend. But what was the RevPAR growth of the Big 8?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Big 8 RevPAR growth was 5.1%, I think, and revenue growth was, I think, a little bit better than that.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Is 5.1%, are you surprised at all with that, given the shift in the holidays and the way the group is ramping up...
Christopher J. Nassetta: No, we expected pretty -- I mean in fact, that outperformed what our expectation was. And the Big 8, because it's just 8 hotels. It ends up being largely a function of sort of when the groups are cycling through year-over-year and the comps of when we have big groups in the year before. So that was actually better than our expectations. The Big 8 are performing really well. They're going to have a great year. As I said, the Big 8, the group position for the second half of the year is up almost 20 -- it's 19-and-change, almost 20% up. So the second half of the year is going to be, from a RevPAR growth point of view, much stronger for the Big 8 than the first half of the year. Second quarter would be better but the second half, much, much better. And again that's just the function of individual hotels and the group business they had last year and groups they have on the books this year.
Kevin J. Jacobs: And Bill, I think for the overall segment, it was 5.1% for the quarter. So the difference between the RevPAR and the revenue wasn't as extreme. And as you said, there were some FX in there and some non-comp stuff, particularly outside the U.S.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: Right. The 5.1% was post-FX, I think, right? But -- yes.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes.
William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division: And I think you nailed it. The follow-up question was do you have any commentary, Chris, on the group trends as we look into '15? I know it's early, but I'd love to get whatever color you might have on that.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, it's early, but the site lines we have feel pretty good. I mean the second half of the year is very good momentum, and I think very indicative of what's going on if I talk to our guys, which I do all the time. On the sales side, they feel very good about the momentum that's building in terms of pace and position into next year, and frankly, into '16. So I think good things are on the way.
Operator: Your next question comes from Felicia Hendrix from Barclays.
Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Chris, on the timeshare side of your business, I'm just wondering if you think the market is valuing your timeshare business appropriately? I mean, Marriott has obviously spun off. And now we have the Hyatt announcement this week. Just wondering, would you be consider -- would you consider spinning off the units and perhaps get some more value?
Christopher J. Nassetta: You'd have to tell me or investors would have to tell me how they're valuing it. I don't -- I don't know the answer in terms of whether it's individually, people are valuing us very weak. We are very committed to the business. Marriott spun theirs, as you point out. Hyatt sold theirs this week. We really like the timeshare business for, I think, some really obvious reasons. Number one, it is a great business. It's our -- the customers in our timeshare business are our most loyal customers. In the hotel side of our business, the day after they buy a timeshare unit, they spend 40% more with us in the hotel business. We like taking the ability to take care of those customers that have become so loyal. We have a very focused strategy, as you know, which has driven great results even through the downturn in terms of growing revenue, growing margin, growing EBITDA. And on top of all of that, as we talked about answering Steve's question, we've been converting the model to be much like the hotel model, where now 80% of our inventory is for third parties, where the returns in the business are going up astronomically, as we depend not on our own balance sheet but on others' balance sheets. So the combination of these customers being so valuable, very good margins, very good growth and not demanding the kind of capital that it has with other companies or what we had been using historically, we are committed to the business. We think it's a great business. And ultimately, we think, as we continue to tell the story and we transform the business to being more and more capital-light, we certainly believe it -- and are hopeful and believe that the markets will reflect it in our value.
Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division: Very helpful. And just for my follow-up regarding asset monetization. You talked about the retail build-out at the Hilton in New York. Just wondering if you have thoughts in terms of partnering on that project, or if there will be any partners? And then any thoughts you might have or updates on plans for the Waldorf?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes. On the New York Hilton, it's a pretty straightforward project. So we certainly will be working with others as it relates to how we end up merchandising it and how we end up finding the right tenants to maximize the opportunity. But in terms of actually doing the construction and the like, it's pretty straightforward. And we think I mean, that our team can do it working in conjunction with some consultants. So we do not intend to have a partner with that. On the Waldorf, obviously, a great deal of interest in it. We understand why. And trust me, we spend a significant amount of time focused on the Waldorf, as I mentioned on the last call. We are deep into the weeds in figuring out the best way to maximize the value of the Waldorf. We think there is a huge amount of value there that is untapped. We are way down the path in figuring that out and figuring out the way to execute against it. We are not yet in a position -- and I'm not being coy, just being honest. We're not in a position to really articulate what that is because we're that's just not far enough down that path. I said on the last call, we -- it would be our objective to be able to lay that out in a great amount of detail by the end of the year, and I think we're on good path to be able to do that.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.
Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Kevin, I think in one of the previous answers you gave you mentioned, you weren't yet prepared to kind of bump up the fee guidance range. But as we looked at it, 17% or so growth year-on-year on the management franchise fees is one of the various surprises to us in the quarter. So I was wondering, could you give us just like a little bit more of a sense of where you are in terms of raising the royalty rates, and how that kind of laps versus last year? Because I think that was one of the big growth drivers that we saw in this quarter.
Kevin J. Jacobs: Yes, it wasn't as much. But raising the royalty rates, we're on track. Every new deal we roll over, the new deals we rolled over in the first quarter were at a full point higher than they were before. The reason you're seeing -- the big reason you're seeing a difference between the 17% we showed in the -- we achieved in the first quarter and the full year is we had some non-comp affiliate fees that were higher in the first quarter that didn't exist, or that were lower in the first quarter of last year, and then we had some timing of some change of ownership fees that were expected in the second quarter, and the deals happened more quickly and they ended up in the first quarter. So the difference is just a little bit of non-comp fees and a little bit of timing, which gets you between -- bridges you between the 2.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, but I think Kevin's right. We would hope to be at the higher end of that guidance. But that's certainly from standpoint of how we're driving the business, and what we see in the first quarter...
Kevin J. Jacobs: And how we feel about RevPAR.
Christopher J. Nassetta: And how we feel about where our RevPARs are going, we would like to be better -- at the better end of that.
Shaun C. Kelley - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division: Sure, that makes sense. And then I guess second question, just big picture, Chris, maybe give us your -- just your thoughts about not specific kind of value opportunities, more just broadly about asset sales and the right time in the cycle to sell. Because we do see a lot more private equity hotel activity starting to pick up, and it does seem like a number of your assets might be attractive to that type of buyer, as we move through the cycle here.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, that's a really good question and a topic we address a lot, both on calls and in meetings. I think we've been pretty consistent, so we'll try and remain consistent, which is we think in terms of the assets that we own, there is tremendous potential in those assets. We are, in our view, as described by sort of being mid-cycle and what's going on in the group and the east [ph] hotels are largely driven by that. We think there's tremendous operating upside in the bulk of these assets. We also, as we, I think, proven with Hawaii, and now New York Hilton, and we talked about what's coming in the Waldorf. And there are other things that we're working on. We think there's tremendous value to enhance the property. So we're very focused on that. To the extent, when we think about whether we should be more asset-light, whether we should hold these, again, we think there's, from a growth point of view, there are a lot of reasons have these assets and benefit from the growth. I said, I think, many, many times, having said that and all those opportunities, we're not in love with having to own real estate. We're in love and committed to creating shareholder value. But we're creating shareholder value as it relates to our assets, purely the big ones that really drive the value is about sort of the after-tax benefits to all of our shareholders. When we talk about the real estate and doing individual asset sales, at least on much of the major real estate, it doesn't make as much sense as potential is looking over time at the real estate as part of more of a structured transaction or a series of structured transactions. And then, it's a little bit different equation, obviously, than what the market is and PE [ph] firm's buying. It really becomes more an equation on where our relative valuations and multiples of OpCos and PropCos. And when we look at that today, we -- and we're happy to get any feedback, anybody who wants to give it. We look at that today, we don't see a meaningful arbitrage that says that OpCo -- that incents you on behalf of the whole shareholder base to want to do something because we don't think that there's a value play. If we thought there was one when and if there is, we won't be shy about it. But the idea of doing large-scale individual asset sales -- I'm not going to say we would do none. We are always exploring and there may be, on a very limited basis, an opportunity for some of that. But any kind of large scale meant the real estate really wants to be done in efficient sort of structured content context.
Operator: Your next question comes from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.
Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division: Most of my questions have been answered. Just your development pipeline continues to grow, nice sequential growth since you reported last in February. Are you getting more requests from developers on Capital Front Hilton to contribute to new deals? Or has it been relatively steady?
Christopher J. Nassetta: I'd say it's been relatively steady. I was, in fact, looking at the numbers a couple weeks ago with our development teams, because we were all together. We -- if you look at the deals we're doing by number that are in the pipeline, it's less than 5% of the overall deals that have any contribution from us. And when you look at it statistically, which is the best way to answer this, that has been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. So statistically, no. In terms of anecdotally when we around the table approving every deal we do, which we do, around this very table we're sitting at, no, it feels about the same. It's very rare that we are contributing. Obviously, 95-plus percent of the time, we are contributing no capital. And it feels about the same as it has.
Operator: Your next question comes from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust.
Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division: My questions have been asked.
Operator: Your next question comes from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: There's a lot of concern heading into the quarter around your New York exposure. Can you just give us what your outsized geographic EBITDA exposure is by city? So like New York, Hawaii, I know you have big exposure, and a lot of people are focused on D.C. Any other markets you can call out?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, I mean, I can do it in -- at a high level summary. In New York, our existing supply is about consistent with what we have across the U.S., so we're not really over-indexed. We have 10.5%, 11% of the U.S. market and we're about 10% -- 10% to 11% of New York. In terms of EBITDA, it's roughly about, with the owned assets there really driving at about 8% of EBITDA. Hawaii is almost an identical, coincidentally identical story. We are, in Hawaii, about sort of at the market for what we have across the U.S., 10% to 11% in U.S. share, 10% to 11% of the Hawaiian market. And it also is about given we have 2 large assets, about 8% of the EBITDA. Affiliate D.C., we over-indexed in terms of what our level of supply is, so we are about 15%. If you look at D.C., and I'm giving D.C. sort of everything, Maryland, Virginia and D.C., sort of the broader radius around D.C. But it only is about 2.7% plus -- less than 3% of EBITDA. And that is obviously in part driven by we don't have any major real estate. It is predominately in D.C. fee -- management franchise fee business.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: That's helpful. And then just, if I heard this correctly, it sounds like you're getting, or you're expecting to get about $600 a square foot for your New York Hilton retail that you're repositioning. Are there other opportunities just on the -- is that right or no?
Christopher J. Nassetta: Yes, that's in the net, directionally.
Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division: I mean, that's a very high number. Are there other properties? Do you think you can do that high rent? Or I mean can you just talk about the retail opportunity in general?
Christopher J. Nassetta: There are -- that's pretty unique. There's probably one other that is reasonably unique in that same city that we talked about earlier, not being coy. The Waldorf, while we have retail at the Waldorf, I would say to you, clearly one of the opportunities and I don't want to go -- obviously, we're not ready to display the whole thing. But clearly, I can say one of the opportunities in the Waldorf is not only to do the retail more intelligently but more of it. If you just take a gander and walk the full city block that we own on Park Avenue, and sort of take it in and think about retail. And I think you would very quickly conclude there are big retail opportunities there. So we -- as part of the overall Waldorf plan, are very, very focused on enhancing the whole retail platform.
Operator: We will take one more question. And it is from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: First question, actually this is for you, Kevin, I might have missed it, but what's the implicit adjusted EBITDA margin growth for full year 2014 guidance? Is it about 250 basis points for the company?
Kevin J. Jacobs: It is about -- sorry, I don't have it.
Christopher J. Nassetta: 150 to 200.
Kevin J. Jacobs: 150 to 200, yes, sorry.
Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division: And then, maybe, Chris, just back on timeshare. Stepping back, can you talk about what the consumer appetite is for timeshare today [ph] compared to maybe the prior peak? because some, I guess I'll call them discretionary products are just a shadow of their former selves and others have been fairly robust. I'd be interested in hearing how you think it's doing versus at prior peak level and maybe what's changed in the industry since the 2000s in terms of who's buying or where that demand is coming from?
Christopher J. Nassetta: It -- I think the story is very simple. And they may -- consumers may not want a lot of other products, but they want timeshare more than they did at the prior peak. So if you just look at our -- the best indication of that is where our sales are versus prior peak, and where it is versus our competition for that matter. But we see increasing velocity of demand in timeshare. The product really resonates with the customer. And thus, the strength of the results that you see. So it's certainly not seen any sort of waning appetite. To the contrary, increasing appetite for the product.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I turn the call over to the presenters.
Christopher J. Nassetta: Well, thanks, everybody. We appreciate the time today. We're obviously quite pleased with the first quarter, and as we've said many times, both focused on the rest of the year and in the coming years, as well as very optimistic about what the rest of this year and the next few years are going to be like. So we look forward to catching up with everybody after our second quarter. Thanks, and have a great weekend.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator: Good morning. My name is Matthew and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Hilton Worldwide Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Financial Results Conference Call and Webcast. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Christian Charnaux, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.
Christian Charnaux: Thank you, Matthew. Welcome to the Hilton Worldwide fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Before we begin we would like to remind you that our discussions this morning will include forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, and forward-looking statements made today are effective only as of today. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these statements. The factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in our SEC filings. You can find a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in today's call in our earnings press release and on our website at www.hiltonworldwide.com. This morning Chris Nassetta, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our year-end results and will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014; Kevin Jacobs, our EVP and Chief Financial Officer will then provide greater detail on our results and outlook. Following their remarks we will be available to respond to your questions. With that, I am pleased to turn the call over to Chris.
Chris Nassetta: Thanks, Christian, and thank you all for joining us today. We are certainly very excited to be back in the public markets and to be hosting our first earnings call, following our IPO in December. We are also very pleased with our performance for last year, highlighted by our system-wide RevPAR growth of 5.2%, and our full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.21 billion, which is a 13% increase year-over-year. I'm sure many of you have heard some version of our story on our various road shows. But for those that have not and at the risk of making this call little longer than normal, I thought I briefly highlight our investment pieces before getting into our 2013 performance and our outlook for 2014. When I joined the company in 2007, at the time of the Blackstone acquisition we were presented with once in a lifetime opportunity to take a nearly 100 year old company that had once been a clear leader in this space but had become complacent and return that company to a leadership position. Many of the pieces were there, including a portfolio of distinct brand, spending all the major customer segments, and strong commercial engines that were delivering good results for owners, but we were an average performer at that on the top-line margins, bottom-line and met unit growth. As an enterprise we certainly were not optimized or aligned strategically. So the first thing we did was to get intense alignment of our organization around a common vision, mission, values, and set up key strategic priorities. Well our work in this regard will never be done we have successfully transformed our business into what is now a lean and unified organization over the performance driven culture. This has enabled the new Hilton Worldwide to outperform our competition, while executing a transformation during one of the worst economic downturns in history. I also believe that our transformation has set us up extremely well to continue to outperform in the future. We are in a business where scale and global diversification matter. And today we're a global business with over 4100 properties and 678,000 rooms in 91 countries and territories. We have 10 distinct brands and scaled commercial engines that drive an industry leading global RevPAR index premium of 15%. Tying it altogether is our award winning Hilton Honors Loyalty Program with 40 million members that today makeup more than 50% of total system-wide occupancy. Our goal is simple. To serve any customer, anywhere in the world through any lodging need they have. By doing so we drive more customer loyalty, higher market share premiums, better returns for our hotel owners, and that in turn drives faster net unit growth, and ultimately premium returns for our shareholders. By intelligently deploying our brands to different regions around the world and optimizing those brands for local markets, we believe we can continue to grow in all regions and under all macroeconomic condition. Our development strategy, which I'll get into in a little bit more detail in a few minutes, is based on our goal to win everywhere. We want to be number one in both pipeline and rooms under construction in every region of the world. Today not only do we have the industry's largest pipeline, but we are also number one in rooms under construction in every major region of the world according to Smith Travel Research. More importantly, our global strategy, growth strategy is built around our capital light management and franchise segment and we've been extremely disciplined with our capital allocation. In this segment, we have added roughly 180,000 net rooms to the system since 2007, which has lead the industry with 37% growth over that time, with an investment of only $47 million. Our pipeline has also been built with the minimus amounts of capital. We believe that if we continue to maintain the strongest brands in the industry, we should not have to allocate significant capital to grow. Our shareholders should also benefit from the embedded upside in our ownership segment which today represents 37% of our adjusted EBITDA. Our diverse portfolio includes iconic assets in some of those best global lodging markets such as New York, London, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Sydney. While we are not activating our real estate segment today in terms of meaningful new unit growth we are extremely active in maximizing what we do own. We believe we can realize on the embedded value in our real estate in three ways. First, we are in the sweet spot of the cycle with group demand driving premium revenue growth in our big group boxes, which combine with our disciplined approach to managing cost, should allow us to continue to drive premium margin growth. This is evidenced in our nearly 300 basis point increase in ownership segment adjusted EBITDA margins in 2013. Second, there are a number of significant value enhancement opportunities embedded in our portfolio. A great example of this is that our Hilton Hawaiian Village property, where we recently entered into a transaction to sell the land and entitlements we obtained over the past few years, which will create significant incremental value from what has been a non-income producing part of the reserve, actually a loading dock. Kevin will give you more detail on the transaction in his remarks and we will continue to keep you updated on additional real estate value enhancement opportunities on future calls. Finally, the third way we could create incremental value from our real estate will be to further our migration to a capital light business model by divesting of some or all of the real estates over time. We are not emotionally tied to our real estate and while we intend to keep the vast majority of these properties in the system, there are ways to accomplish that without owning the hard assets. At the moment, we believe we can benefit from the upside on these assets operationally and from mining value enhancement opportunities, but if divesting of some or all of the real estate will enhance overall shareholder value in the future, we will actively consider those options. Shifting gears in our timeshare business we have taken what has been an extremely successful business historically, with both sales growth and margins outperforming competition and transformed it to a much more capital light business. Today, our timeshare segment derives a significant and growing portion of its earnings from fees. In 2013, 54% of our interval sales were on behalf of the third-parties and 78% of our year-end inventory was capital light. We believe that by expanding a new capital light deal, combined with continuing to develop additional smaller phases of new developments on our own balance sheet, we can continue to grow our timeshare EBITDA at a steady pace with significantly less capital investments than has been spent historically. The last part of our investment thesis is the positive fundamentals in the business, both short-term and long-term. On a macro basis, we believe our business currently stands at the intersection of three powerful global trends. Over the past 20 years growth in global tourism as measured by tourist arrivals has doubled, and is forecasted double again over the next 20 years. Driven by a middle class, it has continued to expand from 1 billion people globally 20 years ago to a projected 5 billion in the next 20. Contrasting net dynamic is the fact that hotel rooms per capita in markets like China and Brazil remains at a small fraction of the level of developed markets like the United States. On a more micro basis, the supply/demand environment of the business remained strong with healthy demand growth outpacing levels of supply growth that are still well below long-term averages. Combined, we believe these trends paid a picture of sustainable growth potential for our business. There will be ups and downs for sure over time but I believe the setup for the next several years and frankly for the long-term growth in our business is as good as I have ever seen. So shifting to our performance. Our system-wide comp RevPAR growth was 5.2% for the full year 2013 on a currency neutral basis that was driven by a 3.3% increase in average rates and a 1.3 percentage point increase in occupancy. Our hotels continue to benefit from strong fundamentals in 2013 with transient growth outpacing group, but it was group picking up momentum during the year. Group was particularly strong in our Big Box Hotel with group business at our Big 8 hotels up 10%, helping to drive Big 8 RevPAR growth of 9.2% for the year. Our owned and leased hotels in the U.S. also performed well growing RevPAR 6.8% for the year. On a system-wide basis we continue to grow our RevPAR index premium up nearly a 12 percentage point. Our strong top-line performance combined with our disciplined approach to managing cost was a significant improvement operating margins in 2013. Our U.S. owned and leased hotels grew operating margins over 250 basis points and globally our owned and operated hotels grew operating margins over a 150 basis points on a currency neutral basis. This operating margin performance in our hotels combined with our overall management and franchise growth of nearly 8%, strong growth in timeshare EBITDA of 18%, and continued corporate cost discipline led to strong growth in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the year. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year, and overall adjusted EBITDA margins increased over 300 basis points versus 2012. Turning to development I thought I'd cover some highlights including what we're doing on our brands around the world. For starters, we approved a record 72,000 rooms for development in 2013 including over 37,000 rooms in the U.S. nearly 15,000 rooms in Asia-Pacific and nearly 10,000 rooms in Europe. And end of the year was an industry leading pipeline that includes over 1,100 hotels and 195,000 rooms. Historically, our pipeline was heavily concentrated in the U.S. When we got to the company over 80% of the pipeline was located in the U.S. Today it is six years later 60% of our pipeline is outside the U.S. and we have very good balance among the region. We've had great success in the Asia-Pacific region growing our pipeline over 55,000 rooms and our Middle East Africa pipeline is the largest in the industry with over 20,000 rooms. Europe is another great example of the success of our development strategy. In 2007 we knew the European market was likely to be value driven for years to come. By investing in our local commercial capabilities and leading with our conversion of family DoubleTree by Hilton brand and our value oriented Hampton and Hilton Garden Inn brands that we customized for the European markets. We went from three non-Hilton Conrad branded hotels in 2007 to over 200 either open or in the pipeline at the end of 2013. Today, we have nearly 30,000 rooms in our European pipeline and more than 16,000 rooms under construction, which is over as twice as many as our nearest competitor. Pipelines are great but the first step in the process of converting a pipeline into fee paying rooms is getting shovels in the ground. Over half the rooms in our pipeline well over a 100,000 rooms are under construction, which is more than 21,000 rooms or 25% ahead of our closest competitor. Our share of rooms under construction globally of 18.6% outpaces our global share of room supply by over four times. And like our pipeline the geographic breakup of our rooms under construction has shifted dramatically. Today 77,000 or 76% of our rooms under construction are outside U.S. compared to just 13% in 2007, which has increased our rooms under construction outside the U.S. by 14 times during that period. This shift in focus to a more geographically diverse development strategy has enabled us to grow significantly outside the U.S. We now have more than 50% more trading rooms outside the U.S. than we did in 2007. But to be clear we have not lost our focus on growth in the U.S. Our category leading focus service brands are in high demand from the development community and in an environment where most new hotel development is being done in those segments. In our conversion friendly whole service brand led by DoubleTree by Hilton, have enabled us to win more than our fair share of those deals as well. Our approximately 25,000 rooms under construction in the U.S. as of year-end 2013, represents 24% of the total rooms under construction U.S. compared to our 11% share of existing U.S. supply. We believe we're in a sweet spot for branded hotel development in the U.S. With fundamentals creating an appetite for hotel development and capital markets that are strong enough to support development, but with enough discipline remaining in the market to ensure that only quality projects with a strong experience of task to them are getting done. This dynamics is keeping overall supply growth in U.S well below long-term averages but allowing us to grow at a faster pace than our competitors. The next step in converting a pipeline to fee paying rooms is of course actually opening hotels. In 2013, we opened 207 hotels with nearly 34,000 rooms. Conversions accounted for 35% of these openings largely in our DoubleTree by Hilton brand. After removals we had net unit growth of more than 25,000 rooms representing growth of over 4% for the year. It's important to note that we achieved this growth with the minimus amount of capital on investment and without any acquisitions. Given our strong pipeline and our rooms currently under construction, we expect net unit growth to accelerate in 2014 and 2015 which I'll get into a little bit more detail in a couple of minutes. We currently mentioned our DoubleTree brand a couple of times in the context of our growth strategy. DoubleTree is one of the great brand success stories during the time we've been at the company. It has become, I'd say somewhat quietly, the fastest growing upscale brand in the lodging business, having doubled in size since 2007, even while we removed nearly 10% of the brand to improve overall quality. Roughly 75% of the room additions have come from conversions of non-Hilton Worldwide brands. We accomplished this by updating the brand DNA to make it more relevant to our customers and by better connecting the brand to our commercial engines including honors. This better connectivity combined with the improvement in the quality of the brand's hotels and a refreshed brand identity including by Hilton in the name have created significant improvement in customer satisfaction and helped increase the overall RevPAR index of the brand by over 600 basis points since 2007. This of course has led to increased owner profitability and presence for the brand, which has enabled it to drive a significant portion of our growth in North America and in Europe, where value conversion plays have been at a premium as well as accelerating its growth in emerging markets through new build. Last year, we opened our 4000th hotel on the Hubei province of China. China continues to be a strong performing market for us with 6.7% comp currency neutral RevPAR growth in 2013. We now have 43 hotels operating in Greater China that's up from 6 in 2007 and a pipeline of more than 140 hotels with more than 46,000 rooms, the largest in the industry among the global brand. Overall in Asia-Pacific, we've had a great success in growing our business having doubled the number of hotels in the region since 2007. And our pipeline of over 55,000 rooms in the region more than five times larger than it was in 2007. One of these pipeline hotels is the stunning Waldorf Astoria in Beijing, which opened last week. We continue to build tremendous momentum with the fastest growing luxury brands in the business. Our luxury portfolio of Waldorf Astoria and Conrad Hotels has more than doubled since 2007 to 47 properties, the 29 hotels in our pipeline will increase our luxury footprint by more than 40% and in some of the most desirable luxury markets in the world such as Jakarta, Bali, Hainan Island, Grand Cayman, Mumbai, Mecca, Suzhou, Doha, Bangkok, Jerusalem, Amsterdam and many more. Turning to our flagship, Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand we have also had great success by focusing on simplifying the full service operating model particularly in the developed world. The goals to get customers more of what they want and they're willing to pay for and less of what they don't making the brand more relevant to get and more profitable for owners. Hilton is the number one ranked hotel brand and global awareness and now has 554 hotels opened and the largest development pipeline in its 94-year history with a 150 projects in the pipeline, 95% of which are outside the U.S. In our focused-service category, are more than 2,800 properties remain a formidable engine of growth, both domestically and increasingly internationally. For example, Hampton continues to expand with more than 350 hotels in its pipeline, including more than 160 open or in the pipeline outside the United States. The brand will open its 2000th hotel early in the second quarter and maintains an unmatched market share premium among midscale brands. Home2 Suites by Hilton is another great example of our ability to innovate on the product side to better serve customers needs and enhance our growth rate. Home2 has opened 28 hotels since launching three years ago, with nearly a 100 hotels in the pipeline and its tremendous initial growth has been achieved entirely 100% with third-party capital. Hilton Garden Inn has 581 existing hotels with 214 in its pipeline; more than 50% of the pipeline is located outside the United States. In fact, we recently opened our first Hilton Garden Inn in China introducing our fifth brand to the Chinese market. The response has been very positive and the brand has another 16 hotels in the pipeline in China. Adding Hilton Garden Inn and soon Embassy Suites in China is the result of our belief of having a full portfolio brand with hotels for every type of guest travel need will be as crucial in China as it is in the developed markets. We firmly believe that our brand lineup is the significant strategic advantage and diverse enough to meet most customer needs in most regions but we are always looking to enhance our ability to serve customers globally. As you've heard from my comments, we continue to expand existing brands geographically and we will continue to explore new brand or brand extension opportunities to serve even more customers and owners in the future, which we look forward to discussing with you in future quarters. Another aspect of staying ahead in our business and growing our industry leading market share premium is continuing to innovate. That innovation can come in the form of innovation in our brand portfolio as I described but it also needs to come from the ways we interact with our customers. Today's traveler wants an increasing level of both choice and control and we're taking advantage of our scale to design and implement solutions across our portfolio to given just that. We pioneered and launched e-check-in over five years ago and today our gold and diamond honors members can check-in online or on their mobile devices and also choose their preferred room at over 3,000 hotels. In the not too distant future, we expect to announce significant enhancements and expansion of this service to make all our guests' journey even easier through their digital device. We all know that travels are increasingly mobile and the growth of our mobile bookings continues to explode. Mobile has experienced a more than eight fold increase in revenue since 2010 and has doubled just over the last 12 months. With mobile-enabled booking channels, particularly our enhanced HHonors and Hilton Apps that we launched last year and new apps hitting the market soon mobile certainly a key focus of our digital agenda. We also continue to focus on driving conversion across all our direct digital channels. Millward Brown Digital for example reports almost having the industry leading conversion and booking share in U.S. Our goal is making our direct channels the preferred channel for our guests. In 2013, we invested in expanding our digital languages and launched 22 language booking and in covering 79 countries. Shifting gears back to performance. Let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2014. We anticipate system-wide RevPAR growth increase 5% to 7% for the full year obviously showing positive momentum versus 2013. We have a very positive outlook for group business with both rooms on the books and rates up meaningfully versus last year. Our 2014 group revenue position at our Big 8 hotels is up 10%, compared to the same time last year. And group business for the same period for our larger group of managed hotels in the U.S. is up 7%. As we look at the macroeconomic picture and outlook for lodging performance around the world, we see generally improving conditions and continued optimism for 2014. In U.S. we expect modestly better GDP growth, which should drive modestly better demand growth, and we expect continued momentum in group bookings, especially with much of the government shutdown and debt ceiling noise behind us. We believe that this demand will be paired with needed supply growth leading to a modestly better RevPAR growth picture than last year. In the Asia-Pacific region, we expect to see continued strong performance again in 2014. Japan was particularly strong as all our hotels delivered double-digit RevPAR growth in 2013. And so far, the outlook for '14 remains very strong as the Japanese government continues to inject liquidity into their markets. China GDP growth is expected to moderate a bit and we expect to see slightly lower RevPAR growth in 2014 of 5.5% to 6%, down from nearly 7% in 2013. In Europe, we expect the improving economic climate experienced in 2013 to continue into '14 and we expect our RevPAR performance to continue to improve a bit as well. London, where we have a very large presence in particular continues to pickup. In 2014 group revenue position in the region overall is up significantly a 20%. Overall, Europe RevPAR growth was relatively strong in 2013 with RevPAR growth of 3.9%, as expected to be up in the mid-single-digits in 2014. The Middle East and Africa region is a tail of individual markets. Our Africa and Indian Ocean, Arabia, Arabian Peninsula, and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia markets have been and are expected to continue to be strong and of course, Egypt remains highly volatile. For the full year 2014, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $2.365 billion to $2.435 billion. In terms of unit growth, we expect to have 35,000 units to 40,000 units to our managed and franchised segments, on a net basis which would represent 5.5% to 6.5% unit growth in that segment and does not assume any growth from acquisitions. On an overall basis, we are optimistic that 2014 will be stronger than '13. There will undoubtedly be ebbs and flows within regions, but generally the macro trend seem to be similar or better than what we saw in 2013. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin Jacobs for a little bit more detail on the fourth quarter and full year results, as well as our 2014 expectations.
Kevin Jacobs: Thanks, Chris, and good morning everyone. As Chris suggested, we are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and full year, which exceeded our expectations. We were also thrilled with what we were able to accomplish last year in the capital markets, completing both our debt refinancing and of course our IPO. I will speak in more detail for the refinancing and IPO in a little bit and then we'll get into our 2014 outlook a bit more. But first let's talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results. Adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.53 for the full year 2013, compared to $0.45 in the prior year, an increase of 18%. Prior to adjustments net income was $415 million for the full year 2013, compared to $352 million for 2012 or $0.45 per share and $0.38 per share respectively. For the fourth quarter, adjusted for special items, EPS was $0.11 compared to $0.10 in 2012. Prior to adjustments net income was $26 million, compared to $61 million in 2012 or $0.03 per share and $0.07 per share respectively. Special items that have been adjusted in both our fourth quarter and full year results include a one-time charge of $306 million associated with the conversion of our private company compensation plan for senior management into stock at the IPO, which was paid entirely out of Blackstone's ownership in the company and not dilutive to shareholders. In the fourth quarter, we recognized a gain on the extinguishment of our prior debt of approximately $230 million and the release of a tax valuation allowance of approximately $90 million net, as low as the GAAP tax benefit on all of those special items. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $603 million, an increase of 16% over 2012 results. Full year 2013 adjusted EBITDA came in at $2.21 billion, a 13% increase over 2012. System-wide comparable RevPAR increased 4.7% for the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year on a currency neutral basis. Our growth rate for the quarter was a bit lower than we saw in the previous three quarters, which was largely driven by a decrease in government business resulting from the government shutdown. During the quarter our brands continued to gain overall market share and we also ended the year with a strong December recording RevPAR growth of over 6%. In terms of our regional performance, in the United States for the year continued economic recovery drove comparable system-wide RevPAR growth of over 5% and comparable U.S. owned and operated hotels were up over 6%. San Francisco and Hawaii remained strong markets for us with comparable RevPAR in those markets up 13% and 12% respectively. The New York market was a bit softer as difficult year-over-year comparisons and the continued absorption of new supply led to RevPAR growth of the market of just 3.5% for the year on a comparable system-wide basis. Our owned hotels in New York were a bit stronger with RevPAR growth of nearly 4%. In Europe, strong performance in the UK and Ireland, particularly in London, as well as key markets in Continental Europe led to comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth for the full year of 3.9% primarily driven by occupancy. Germany, Amsterdam, and Turkey were also strong performing markets for us in the quarter. In the Middle East and Africa region comparable currency neutral RevPAR grew 6.4% for the year, even with continued political unrest in Egypt, somewhat hurting our overall results for the region. We saw strength in the Arabian Peninsula, even with a drag from Saudi visa restrictions and the African Indian Ocean market was strong despite softness in Nairobi due to the terrorist attack that happened there in the third quarter. In the Asia-Pacific region we continued to outperform with strong demand in Japan and China driving comparable currency neutral RevPAR growth of 7% for the full year. Next I'd like to take you through some highlights of our segment results. Total management and franchise fees were $333 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 10% over the fourth quarter of 2012. For full year 2013, total management and franchise fees were $1.27 billion, an increase of roughly 8% over the full year of 2012. In our ownership segment, adjusted EBIDTA for the fourth quarter of 2013 of $254 million was roughly 12% higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, driven by strong RevPAR growth of 5.1% in the U.S. and operating margin growth at our U.S. owned and leased hotels of over 180 basis points. For full year 2013, adjusted EBIDTA for the ownership segment increased 17% to $926 million, again driven by strong comparable RevPAR growth in the U.S. of 6.1% and cost discipline at our U.S. owned and leased hotels where operating margins increased over 250 basis points. In the timeshare segment, 2013 adjusted EBIDTA of $297 million was 18% better than the prior year. As Chris mentioned earlier we recently executed a purchase and sale agreement with a Blackstone led partnership with third-party capital investors for the sale of certain land and entitlement rights at our Hilton Hawaiian Village Resort in connection with the planned timeshare development project to be called the Grand Islander. This transaction is great example of the tremendous momentum we have in moving our timeshare business through a capital light model and the attraction we've gained in the institutional investor community around the tracking product capital for development. It's also the first step of many and I'm unlocking the embedded value in our real estate portfolio as we expect to generate about $375 million of overall EBIDTA and roughly $180 million of incremental net present value out of what has been historically a non-income producing part of the resort. We expect to commence sales of the timeshare units of the property in the fourth quarter of 2014, and for construction to be completed in late 2016. We will keep you updated on our progress on this exciting project. Turning to our balance sheet, in addition to the $1.24 billion of net proceeds from the IPO, we closed on the complete refinancing of our prior acquisitions got in multiple markets during the fourth quarter, creating a balance sheet that we believe is a tremendous asset for the company and will provide us with an incredible amount of financial possibility for the future. Prior to the IPO, we refinanced a vast majority of our long-term debt through multiple transactions raising $13.1 billion of new debt along with a $1 billion under our revolver. These proceeds along with available cash were used to repay approximately $13.5 billion of debt outstanding, which was the remaining dollars of the loan originated to acquire the company in 2007. The principal components for the refinancing included a $7.6 billion floating rate, 7-year term loan facility and $1.5 billion of unsecured 5.625% senior notes due 2021, as well as a $3.5 billion 5-year commercial mortgage backed securities loans secured by 23 of our U.S. owned hotels and a $525 million mortgage secured by the Waldorf Astoria in New York. We also entered into interest rates swaps on a total of $1.4 billion of the term debt, which set our ratio of fixed to floating rate debt at 50:50. Additionally we put in place approximately $700 million of financing against our timeshare receivables in the form of a $450 million conduit and $250 million of asset backed securities, all of which are non-recourse for the company. Subsequent to this refinancing we made $1.6 billion of voluntary prepayments on the term loan, including $360 million from available cash and the $1.24 billion of net IPO proceeds. As a result the outstanding dollars of the term loan facility at year-end was $6 billion. Additionally subject to the provisions in the loan agreement the margin on the floating portion of this term loan was stepped down by 25 basis points in accordance with the IPO and is now set at 275 basis points. As of year-end we had net debt of $11.5 billion at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.2%, and a weighted average maturity of 6.2 years. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $860 million, including $266 million of restricted cash and we had no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion revolver. Finally, let's turn to our outlook for 2014. For the full year, as Chris mentioned, we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 5% and 7% on a comparable currency neutral basis with 60% to 70% of that being driven by rate. Ownership segment RevPAR is expected to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on the same basis. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of between $2.365 billion and $2.435 billion. Management and franchise fees are expected to increase between 10% and 12%. In timeshare we expect segment adjusted EBITDA to be between $310 million and $325 million. We expect CapEx spending, excluding timeshare inventory, to total approximately $350 million, including about $250 million to $260 million in hotel CapEx, which represents roughly 6% of ownership revenue. We expect corporate and other segment expense to increase between 3% and 5% including incremental public company cost. We expect diluted EPS adjusted for special items of between $0.57 and $0.61 for the full year. For the first quarter of 2014 we expect system-wide RevPAR to increase between 4.5% and 6.5% on a comparable currency neutral basis. In the U.S. and UK we expect the weather we have experienced so far this year to marginally affect Q1 RevPAR growth. However this should be somewhat offset by the lapping of the beginning of the U.S. government sequester during the first quarter of 2013. We expect adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of between $480 million and $500, which include a one-time benefit of approximately $25 million from the reversals and the accrual related to the conversion of our prior cash based long-term incentive compensation plan into a restricted stock plan for our Vice Presidents and below. That benefit will reverse itself by year-end in the form of share based compensation expense. Further detail on our fourth quarter and full year guidance can be found in the earnings release we distributed earlier this morning. This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have. Matthew, back to you.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Joe Greff with JP Morgan.
Chris Nassetta: Hi, Joe.
Joe Greff - JP Morgan: Welcome back. Looking at your 2014 EBITDA guidance and other outlook components how does that translate into free cash flow multiple debt reduction for the year? In other words, it is what other non-cash add-backs or the working capital items are there to drive your free cash beside the simplistic method EBITDA less interest less taxes less CapEx?
Chris Nassetta: I think that gets you pretty close to the right number. I mean I'd say that based on the sort of range of outcomes, it's about $700 million to $900 million, roughly that should be available for debt reduction in the year.
Joe Greff - JP Morgan: And then the upfront cash that you get from monetizing the land and your rights at the Hilton Hawaiian Village how much is that I know Kevin you mentioned what's the net present value of that?
Kevin Jacobs: The land sale component of it is $25.4 million and then the rest of the MPV is in the sales and marketing and operating agreements that we're entering into.
Joe Greff - JP Morgan: Chris, earlier you painted a generally optimistic picture for net unit growth. Can you just talk about the mood in the hotel development community specifically in China right now I guess what markets are there with positive momentum and for what demand, how does China generally feel?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I mean -- I'd say still not withstanding the GDP growth is moderating a little bit and they -- and China is clearly been trying to make sure that they don't end up with a real estate bubble. It's clearly still generally pretty positive. There was a period of time I would say sort of in the first half of last year where China development really slowed down. It picked up pretty materially, it didn't get back to the peak levels but it picked up pretty materially in the second half of last year, and what we see so far in China in the beginning of this year and we said in our Investment Committee Meeting in the last couple of weeks where we review all the deals we're doing. It feels -- it still feels pretty good. It is changing and so my comments about Hilton Garden Inn and my prepared comments and what we're doing with the launch of Embassy which will occur later in the year would put in those -- would put my comments for a reason and that is definitely to signal that there is change of thought I think. There's no question that full service and luxury we still have pretty good momentum in China, but the pace at which this new development is getting done I think in the market generally at the high end of the business as close somewhat and I think it's picking up in the midscale segment of the business. So we've been very, very focused on Garden Inn. We think Embassy has adapted for that market as a great sort of value play in the full service space that's going to play well. We haven't done it yet, but we haven't launched it yet, but we've been working on our Hampton launch in the China market. We've done all sort of the background work and research and development work for how we would adapt that product for the market. So I think you're going to look to see that over the next couple of quarters that we will be doing something and what I would describe is sort of the 3.5 star space in China. So I'm -- listen, long-term I'm very optimistic about the development opportunities in China. In the short to intermediate term I'm pretty damn optimistic as well, I just think that the makeup of it is increasingly going to be more in the midmarket and less at the upper end of the market. We're very focused on, as I said, we think it's really important not just for building our business in China, which is important to serve the billion plus people in China, but China is very rapidly becoming the number one outbound market in the world in the next couple of years will have 100 million outbound travelers and we want to have a very sort of like we do in developed parts of the world Europe and U.S., very broad distribution at all the important price points so that we build mass sort of loyalty to our family brand, both to build our business in China, but as increasingly Chinese travelers leave the market they're going to -- we think they're going to stay with the brands when they're in other parts of the world that they become loyal to in their home market. So we're focused on that and I think the most important way that that's going to happen meaning broad distribution within China is going to happen in the three-and-a-half to four star space not in the five plus star space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura. Your line is open.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: Yes, very good. I wanted to just focus on the U.S. for a minute. In the U.S., in 2013 you ended -- your occupancy ended at about 73% and you talked about group business in '14 being pretty strong. You really needed that this level of occupancy, what are your occupancy growth expectations for this year? And then the second part of the question is recently what have you been seeing in, in the quarter for the quarter group demand has that been much of a help or a headwind?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, on the occupancy side listen it's a tail of mortgage and assets. So I think as you look at it 73% might -- we're going to have as Kevin suggested, we would probably have our RevPAR growth, you're going to have somewhere between half a point and a point of occupancy growth. You're certainly getting to the point where you don't need a lot more occupancy broadly in the system and my guess is that 60% to 70% rate growth figure that we get will be even higher next year. So I think we're getting from a cycle point of view to the point where as you're implying in your question, we want to be and we certain -- don't get me wrong, we're certainly focused on rates and we will be increasingly focused on rates, but there will be a little bit more broad sort of system-wide U.S. occupancy gain this year. Well that's basically come on the group side, if you look at on average 73% it's great but if you look at it sort of by individual segments particularly looking at the big group hotels, big commercial hotels they still have occupancy to go, because we are mid cycle in my opinion in terms of where we are broadly that is generally when you see the group business come back that's when you see these big hotels really start to perform as a result of building that, that that be. And I would say from the standpoint of the real big boxes and bigger markets unlike may be sort of the limited service in suburban secondary markets, there is more occupancy there. So you're not going to see a whole lot of occupancy and a lot of markets moving, but you're going to see it disproportionally moving in the bigger market and in these big very large hotels, if that answer the question. In terms of I would say that group position I gave you in my comments very strong up year-over-year, the way I would describe pace, which means a different timeframe sort of what we are doing in different periods of time booking on a year-over-year basis. You probably wouldn't be surprised that in the fourth quarter we saw some pace declines and that was we can pretty much track if that was the result of a lot of what was going on with the U.S. Government and the government shutdown and the potential throughout of debt ceiling issues and budget debate that had not been solved, and every time that flares up, we've pretty consistently seen people that are making longer lead decisions and that's what's going on with group, start to freeze up. So we had very healthy pace. I would say in the first quarter through third quarter overall, fourth quarter, not as much we think a direct sort of results for that. And the good news is in terms of what we see thus far this year, we've seen that stabilize and start to pickup. So pace is positive and what we see right now and obviously the position is positive. Now, that we are pretty -- we think certain I mean if not entirely certain that you're not going to have any -- if the budget discussion is done, looks like that everybody has agreed to a increase in the debt ceiling that gets us to the second quarter of next year. At this point, we think that portends very good things for the group business. We think that the business is there, the demand there and without -- this is technical term without the Psychobabble that has been going on in Washington, we think there is a -- that the business will continue to pickup. We obviously saw a great -- I said we were up 10% group in our Big 8 last year; we were up 10% again this year in terms of position. The Big 8 had great RevPAR growth last year. We expect to have a very good RevPAR growth, higher than the high-end of our guidance driven by these factors, which is building both occupancy but also rate in the group side and providing that strong foundation for us to continue to squeeze out lower price transient business and only take the best transient business.
Harry Curtis - Nomura: And then, just a very quick follow-up on your incentive management fees. There seems to be some headwinds in 2013, the IMS were pretty flat. What are your expectations for '14; it should be a tailwind in '14?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, I think listen what's going on in '13 is just some year-over-year comp issues at the -- we had some contracts that were sort of changed and one in particular, a very big one in Mecca that distorted what was going on with incentive management fees. It obviously -- it's a very positive thing for the company. We restructured an existing agreement and changed the incentive management fee arrangements and returned for I think 4500 new rooms that were doing with this developer in Mecca over the next -- that will be opening over the next three or four years, so a very positive thing, but it distorted the IMS. This year, IMS growth was going to be sort of in the 8% to 10% range. I'd say that's sort of the beginning of a very nice trajectory in the sense that if we look at what we have under construction around the world a 102,000 room, 75%, 80% of those are international the vast majority of those are sort of in the full service and luxury space, almost every one of those have incentive management fee contracts. For the record they don't stand behind on our priorities, those are the really good kind. And as we deliver those hotels into the system -- and obviously they are under construction, so that will be happening fairly rapidly, you will start to see a very nice trajectory of growth and incentive management fee. So the 8% to 10% that you see this year should be over the next couple years ramping up the 20% plus growth in IMS.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank: Just a quick follow-up on Kevin's comments earlier. When you talk about the Hilton Hawaiian Village deal, when you think about the broader portfolio, how many more opportunities do you guys think there are that are similar in scope and similar in nature to this?
Chris Nassetta: I'd say listen, we're working on it every day and we -- as you can tell from the Hawaiian Village description it's not like we woke up yesterday and said hey here is an idea, I mean it took us probably three-and-a-half years to get the entitlement, to be able to turn that loading dock into a 400 plus unit tower in on Waikiki Beach. And so we've been working on some of these. I'd say we clearly have a handful of these types of opportunities that are sizeable, I don't want to say it's this -- but that are meaningful sort of NPV value to the company. I mean the truth is we have a big real estate portfolio. So we have dozens and dozens of opportunities in that portfolio to create value in every way from an operating point of view and smaller value enhancement opportunities. But the big one, there is probably a handful. There is a Hawaiian Village there; a number of things in New York and our biggest assets is the New York Hilton at the Waldorf Astoria, other assets in Hawaii, like Waikoloa potentially in London with the Park Lane and some others. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves. Those know me from my prior days as a Public Committee CEO. We would rather do it and then market it rather than market it and then do it. So we are very pleased to be able to announce the Hawaiian Village deal because it's done. We have got great progress on all of the others that I just mentioned. And I think you should expect to continue to see some good progress from us on all of those.
Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank: And then, if I could just one follow-up. I know you guys mentioned earlier index, RevPAR index, in terms of kind of share in the U.S. not so much from a development standpoint, more so from an operational standpoint, where do you guys see yourself taking it from not may be a specific competitor but within the segments, where do you guys see yourselves most kind of outpacing?
Chris Nassetta: That's always the question that we get and the truth in the matter is we don't ever really know because we know what's happening, otherwise which travel works, right. We know what's happening with us, we don't really know exactly what's happening with anybody else the way the system works. My sense is, and this is going to sound sort of like the obvious answer, it's a little bit of everywhere. I do think that for all the reasons I talked about, when I talked about innovation and I talked about honors and what we're doing in distribution and then what we're doing on online and mobile and e-checking and all these things, I think they suggest that the bigger, more powerful global brand are getting stronger. I'm not saying we're not taking some share from our big global competitors. I hope and my guess is we are a little bit, but I would guess, is sort of, without knowing very specifically, I would guess that more of the share is coming from the independent and the smaller regional and local players. So a little bit everywhere but may be a little bit more from there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs: So two questions, first, just on debt any guidance on using free cash flow for may be an accelerated debt paydown in 2014 and linked to that your asset sales, your willingness to sell hotels any additional color on the target, the number of hotels you'd like to sell in 2014. How many are actually actively being marketed? And then, so I think to Carlo's question just a moment ago on timeshare inventory how do you balance selling your own versus selling somebody else's inventory? Obviously selling somebody else's inventory is almost like infinite return on investment or pretty close to it. On the other hand leaving assets on your balance sheet, it leaves your own assets on your balance sheet. So I'm trying to get a sense for how you're balancing that over the next couple of years?
Chris Nassetta: I'll take the second and third and may be ask Kevin to then talk about the debt side of it. So on sales we have -- we do not have a lot that we intend to sell in 2014. We do have a few what I'd describe as dribs and drabs, very small assets, a few in the UK that we've been working on. But would be I'd view it as given our scale the minimus. And the reason for that is I said it in my prepared comments that the short version of it is listen we think we're in a sweet spot of the ownership cycle. We like what's going on in those assets. We love what's going through that that portfolio is really very heavily influenced by the group business which is coming back. We just invested huge amounts in over $2 billion over a period of time and in the assets we're getting the benefit of that. We got these value enhancement opportunities that we want to mind and we haven't been able to mind, not because we didn't know how to do it but because our debt structure really didn’t allow us. So our attitude right now is other than as I say some very minor sales, which would be immaterial to really try and mind the value of this. Over time as I said if we believe that there's an opportunity to create incremental shareholder value by doing something with some or all the real estate, we will not be shy about that. The likely way that we would do it would be really more in a sort of structured format, wouldn’t have to be all of it, but it might be in very large chunks of it to make sure that we create tax efficiency. So it's not, as I said we're not in any way emotionally attached to the real estate. Our predecessors may be were, we're not. We're emotionally attached to driving shareholder value rate now. We think the right way to do that is to mind these opportunities and at least the short-term and look at where the market goes and where multiples are and look at whether at some point we think that there is an ARB opportunity where doing something with the real estate would create a greater value preposition for everybody involved. On the timeshare inventory, listen I think the way to think about that is we're very thoughtful about where we're doing these deal and I think what I would say, it's really driven by the customer, right. So we're trying to do deals in markets with third-parties that are not overlapping with our inventory. So it is really driven and we are actively selling both our own inventory and what's remaining as well as third-party inventory. We have little or no overlap. It's really is where we end seeing the demand coming from a customer point of view, increasingly as you know, I gave the stat at the end of the year we were 78% in terms of inventory for third-parties. If you fast forward and you put the numbers in for the Hawaiian Village deal we're going to do, you're sort of in the low to mid 80s. So as time goes on, the fact of the matter is the vast majority of our inventory is from, is representing third-party. But we're actively selling everything that is on our balance sheet and it gets ultimately sort of driven by customer demand.
Kevin Jacobs: Yes, Steve for the debt question, Chris mentioned $700 million to $900 million of cash available or free cash flow. We would use the entirety of that to repay the term loan. The term loan is floating rate. It's fully pre-payable with no questions. So it's our most efficient debt to repay. And our goal would be to continue use the LION share of our free cash flow to repay debt, but with goals of being investment grade and we think we can achieve that over the next two to three years. We finished the year at 5.2 times net debt to EBITDA. We think we will finish -- if we do that $700 million to $900 million we will finish 2014 in about 4.50 times.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Your line is open.
Anthony Powell - Barclays: Hi, good morning it's actually Anthony Powell here for Felicia. How are you?
Chris Nassetta: Hey, Anthony, how are you doing?
Kevin Jacobs: How are you doing?
Anthony Powell - Barclays: Doing well. On supply growth there seems to be some supply growth in the focus service segment in the U.S. Do you see hitting the supply impacting some same store RevPAR trends at your focus service hotels in your portfolio?
Chris Nassetta:
 : What I would say is, I mean clearly, there is a little bit more supply coming. If last year, really get the aggregate data, it was sort of a little below 1%. We think this year it is going to be over 1%. Next year, probably if you look at all of the lead numbers, what's in the pipeline that will get under construction, it's still probably in our mind 1.5%, that's again a 30-year average of 2.5%. So at least over the next sort of two to three years we think it's very muted. We think really in terms of what we see going on, there is quite a bit of discipline in the market. There is money to develop but there's not a lot and it's only with the best developers that it's really getting done and the best brands. Thankfully for us, I think we're viewed given the market share premiums we have as being amongst the best if not the best in that category. So as I said, we got 25% of what is under construction, and we only have 10% or 11% of the existing supply. So we feel pretty good. I don't think -- we don't that there is material impact from it until you get much higher in the supply cycle. So I pick a number, I mean historically, I think you got to get up to 2% or getting up closer to the 30-year average, I think it's probably is the time we have to start to think about it. But we were closer to one then we are two or even one-and-a-half, I think we feel very good about it. And the fact is, demand should be growing and at a little bit faster pace in the U.S. because I think everybody would say -- and now with the government noise behind us at least for this year probably at least a couple of years, that you're going have better GDP growth which is going to drive greater demand growth in an environment where there is still tiny tidy pickup in supply when you look at the aggregate numbers.
Anthony Powell - Barclays: And one follow-up. Do you see any opportunities to add new brands to your portfolio? Thank you.
Chris Nassetta: The answer is yes, I did a very crazy job of alluding to that and I apologize for that. As I said, my sort of style those of you know me know what is like -- we want to do things and then market them for you guys and everybody else. So we do have a bunch of ideas. Right now, we're dealing as we talked about with Garden Inn with Embassy in China and a lot of our brands, the existing brands. We are being very strategic about how we deploy those and how we enter various markets and launch those in various regions of the world. We do have some things that we are working on in terms of both new brands and potentially what I would describe as brand extensions of an existing brand. And I do expect sort of over the next two or three or four quarters that you're going to hear at least a couple of things from us in that regard. One, which I know everybody, loves to talk about in the boutique space, which I did ask probably more than any other question on earth and even though you didn't ask it, I will certainly answer it. We are definitely working on a concept there. We have a little different view, which I will wait to explain may be on -- in the next -- a call or two out, but we have had and continue to have a little bit of reviews and our competitors or many of our competitors about how to do that and sort of what exact -- what it looks like, what price point it ends up at. We've done a ton of work, we are getting closer I would hope in the not too distant future we can -- you'll be hearing from us on that. That would probably be the first thing or amongst the first things that you would hear.
Operator: Your next question comes from line of Joshua Attie with Citi. Your line is open.
Joshua Attie - Citi: As we think about the 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance, what are the variables that put you at the high and low end? Is it the performance of group business, is it your ability to drive rate or are there markets that are question marks? And I know there are probably multiple items that influence your thinking, but where do you think the main levers are to the upside or downside or the biggest question marks in your mind as you think about this year?
Chris Nassetta: Yes. Listen, I think getting to the higher end would depend on the things you alluded to, that the continued strength that we've seen in transient, which has been strong. But we assume if you want to get to the higher end of that then you would have to have at or maybe even a little bit above sort of where the transient growth was. You need the group to show up, the group business to show up the way that the way that we're hoping and we think there is potential for that. And probably I'd say you need nothing big to go wrong in the world. Right, I mean the problem whether there is upside and downside of being a very big globally diversified company that ultimately when Egypt is a problem more if when Japan is strong it's great, if Japan is weak they can drag you down. So I think -- I don't listen, I don't think it's -- I believe that we're pretty upset, we gave a range for a reason because it's a big company, a lot of things can happen around the world. We think that at the upper end of that range, it's possible or we wouldn't give you that range and I think it depends on those things. Continued slight uptick in transient, definite uptick in group, and so a nothing major going wrong around the world.
Joshua Attie - Citi: And I know you don't want to give too many details on projects until they're finalized, but can you talk broadly about your thoughts on the Waldorf in terms of a potential redevelopment?
Chris Nassetta: Yes, we have spent a lot of time and some money as you can see if any of you have been to the Waldorf, we've spent over the last five or six years about $175 million and some of that's sort of behind the wall, so you don't see it. Some of it is upfront, I mean, we've been working on the exterior of the building to do the work that needed to be done for about a 100 years. We did -- we have redone the Park Avenue lobby, the motor court. If you haven't seen I mean, amazing progress and done a lot of work to figure out sort of from a rooms point of view what we want to do. We have not taken that next step, because we've been in the process of doing -- excuse me a whole bunch of work and analysis around what's the highest and best use would be from a -- from standpoint of maximizing the value to the shareholders of the company and there are a bunch of different ways to do that and there a bunch of different people, we could do that with recognizing that not to coy that we talk a lot about capital light, obviously it's really complete what we like to have at the Waldorf, certainly it would require a lot of capital. So I would say to you by the end of this year hopefully sooner, we will be in a position to layout exactly what we think the plan is to the Waldorf both in terms of what we're going to do with it physically and who we might do it with in order to continue to focus on our being capital light. And I'm sorry to be coy, again we're just in the middle, we've done a kind of work over a bunch of years, we're sort of in the middle of completing that work and I don't think it's going to be too far out before we can give you good sidelines. We will fix the Waldorf that I will tell you and there a couple of different sort of major pathways to doing that and we're finishing the work to be able to conclude that.
Operator: This concludes today's Q&A session. I will turn the call over to our presenters for any closing remarks.
Chris Nassetta: Well, thanks everybody. Listen, I said a couple of times, it's great to be back, it took us six year hiatus from the public market, but after 50, I think consecutive earnings calls it's nice to be back doing quarterly earnings calls. We are obviously very pleased with our results for 2013, both the fourth quarter full year. We feel great about the environment, very optimistic about 2014, and we will look forward to giving you an update after we complete our first quarter. Thanks again for spending the time with us today.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.
