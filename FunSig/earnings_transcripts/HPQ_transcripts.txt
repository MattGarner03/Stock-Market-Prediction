Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2025 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory and market share references are based on calendar quarter information. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations due to comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered top line revenue growth, increased momentum across our key growth areas and maintain our focus on positioning HP for long-term success. Today, I will focus on three main areas: first, our Q1 results and key innovation highlights. Second, a deeper dive on our business unit performance. And finally, I will share our outlook for the year ahead including the actions we are taking to respond to evolving market conditions while continuing to fuel our long-term growth. Let me now turn to our Q1 results. Overall, we delivered revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter, up 2% year-over-year. This was largely driven by growth in our Personal Systems, commercial business and key growth areas. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.74 sales was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Operating profit margins for both Print and Personal Systems were in line with our expectations. These results demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments and execute our strategy to build a stronger HP. Last quarter, I outlined our ambition to lead the future of work. We know companies need highly productive workforces to drive growth and employees are seeking fulfillment in the work they do. With our robust portfolio of PCs, printers, peripherals and more, we not only have a unique competitive advantage as we sit at the intersection of this opportunity. I am pleased to report we are making solid progress against our strategy. We are doubling down on our efforts in the commercial segment and aggressively investing and innovating in new AI and software capabilities. As an example of that, we recently entered into an agreement to acquire strategic assets from Humane. Once completed, we will benefit from their AI-powered platform Cosmos highly skilled technical team and hundreds of patents. With this acquisition, we will accelerate our plans to build an intelligent ecosystem across all HP devices, from AI PCs to smart printers and connected conference rooms. We look forward to boosting our technology and innovation organization by integrating the Humane team to HP. We're also realigning our key growth areas to reflect the shift of our investment focus on the future of work. In addition to hybrid systems, workforce solutions consumer subscriptions, industrial graphics and CD, we are now including AI PCs an Advance Compute Solutions, such as workstations and retail solutions. Gaming will no longer be one of the key growth areas and will instead be managed as part of our core portfolio because even though it will continue to be a very important business for us, is not directly related to the future of work. Collectively, we expect these realign key growth areas to continue to grow faster than the core and to be accretive to our margins over time. Turning to our innovation highlights. In Q1, our vision for the future of work was brought to life at CES with AI-powered innovations. For example, we announced several new models of AI PC. We are empowering professionals with faster decision-making an effective collaboration with the EliteBook Ultra, adapting to how and where people work best, our EliteBook X offers flexibility and enhanced security protection. And these new PCs now bring HP's award-winning AI companion to our Intel platforms. And for product designers and data scientists, the Zbook Ultra recognized with the best laptop award at CES can help manage complex projects and data sets with ease. We are strengthening the end-to-end experience of hybrid workers with Thunderbolt Docks, with a quick connect locking experience employees are instantly connected to their workspace before they even sit down at their desk. In gaming, we introduced OMEN AI beta, a groundbreak software innovation that automatically adjust or optimize performance. Our customer-centric approach also expands our print innovation. To meet the growing demand for convenience, we recently added Smart Tank printers to our HP all-in subscription plans, is all-inclusive print program has strongly resonated with our customers. In Industrial, we're empowering print providers with new equipment and capabilities. With the introduction of two game changes, HP PageWide process, we are delivering high-speed, high-quality print production. As we continue to innovate, we remain committed to technology that fastest connection improves access and support sustainability. In 2024, HP reached nearly 20 million people through digital equity programs and partnerships. And I am proud to share earlier this month, HP jumped to the number 2 spot on America's most JUST Companies list. Our progress was driven in large part by how we invest in our employees, support our communities, and treat our customers. We were recognized as the leader in our industry for all three. In a few weeks, we will host Amplify, our flagship conference to engage with customers and partners. This event provides an opportunity to share our vision and the progress we have made, including how we are delivering AI-powered innovation and technology experiences. This past quarter, HP led the way in shaping the future of work, thanks to the dedication of our talented team. And I want to take the opportunity to thank all of them. Let me now turn to Personal Systems performance for the quarter. Revenue was up 5% year-over-year, with commercial continuing to power the growth more than offsetting a declining consumer and continued softness in China. We drove share gains in the PC commercial Windows market, particularly in high-value categories, such as commercial premium. However, we lost sharing consumers with units down year-over-year. While our strategy is not to gain share for the sake of gaining share, you should expect us to improve our performance through the year in this segment, especially in the premium category. Worldwide PC commercial revenue grew 10% year-over-year, fueled in part by the growing adoption of AI PC and the positive impact of the Windows 11 refresh cycle. The AI PC market experienced remarkable momentum, achieving a sequential growth rate of 25% in calendar quarter 4, and we continued to gain share in this market. We believe the refresh cycle, combined with an increasing mix of AI PCs, will further propel our commercial growth through fiscal year 2025 and beyond. Internally, we are empowering our teams with enhanced AI tools. Going forward, all new PCs we purchase will be AI-PCs, giving our teams greater insights and helping them better address customer needs. In our growth area, hybrid systems, advanced computes, and AI-PCs delivered strong performance with revenue up year-over-year. We believe there is more opportunity here, and will continue to prioritize investment in this category. Shifting to print, we saw strong unit growth and share gains in home, and specifically big tanks. In office, we maintained our share overall, and importantly, gained share in our strategic areas, A4 value and A3. We continue to see a competitive price in marketing office and weak demand in China that will continue to push us to improve our operational execution. For the print business, revenue declined 1% in constant currency year-over-year, in line with our expectations. In growth area, consumer subscription revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year. This quarter, we achieved a milestone of one million instant paper subscribers with double-digit revenue growth, and we continue to drive revenue growth in industrial graphics. In workforce solutions, momentum continues with revenue growth year-over-year. We had several new managed print wins during the quarter, including Prime Healthcare. This new customer in a growing industry enables us to support the IT journey, covering 44 hospitals and more than 45,000 employees. And we saw notable wins in managed device services in multiple verticals, which include automotive, industrial, banking, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals in multiple geographies. The range of deals demonstrates our ability to close and manage diverse customer deals around the globe. Before I close, it's important that I take a moment to share the efforts underway to address the evolving external environment. We have been tracking geopolitical developments and are well prepared to respond to these shifting dynamics. Over the past few years, we have taken proactive measures to ensure manufacturing resiliency. We have built a globally diverse supply chain, and we are continuing to expand our footprint across multiple countries to meet growing customer demand and bolster multi-source production. We have made significant progress, and by the end of fiscal year 2025, we expect more than 90% of HP products sold in North America will be built outside of China. China will continue to be an important manufacturing hub for the rest of the world. As we look ahead, we are managing the current tariff increases on China and have included them in our outlook. Should additional tariffs be implemented, we would manage them the same way we have with China, leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network along with cost improvements and pricing actions as needed. Depending on the scope, while some of our mitigating actions can take a few months lead time, we would be focused on fully offsetting overtime. During the first two years of our Future Ready plan, we have made excellent progress across process efficiency, automation, portfolio optimization, and operational excellence. This has given us visibility into additional opportunities aligned to our future of work strategy. There is even more we can do to reduce our structural costs, and we now plan to deliver $1.9 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by the end of fiscal year 2025. These incremental structural savings will help mitigate macro and geopolitical uncertainties while continuing to support investments in strategic areas. Karen will share more details about this shortly. I will close by reiterating our confidence in our full-year outlook and our ability to deliver on our strategy to lead the future of work. As demonstrated in Q1, we have continued to build strong momentum while taking the measures necessary to mitigate risk, navigate policy changes, and importantly, invest in our long-term growth. Let me now turn it over to Karen.
Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our first quarter results and the solid progress on delivering towards our financial commitments for the year. We drove revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter with continued strength in the personal systems commercial business and momentum in our key growth areas. We also gained share in a stabilizing print market while executing against our plan to drive strong operating margins. We have made excellent progress in accelerating our future-ready plan and, as Enrique said, have increased the gross annualized run rate savings target for the program by the end of fiscal year 2025. And through disciplined execution and rigorous cost management, we delivered on our EPS commitments while maintaining important investments in strategic areas, including the future of work. Now taking a closer look at the details of the quarter, net revenue was up 2% nominally and 3% in constant currency, with growth across all regions. In constant currency, APJ grew 5%, Americas grew 3%, and EMEA grew 2%. Gross margin was 21%, down year over year due to increased commodity costs. As mentioned last quarter, we have put in place cost reduction and pricing actions to offset these headwinds. However, they will take time to ramp through the year, leading to stronger margins in the second half. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up year over year, reflecting continued investment in key strategic initiatives and our people, offset in part by disciplined cost management, including future-ready cost savings. All in, non-GAAP operating profit was $984 million, in line with our expectations. Below the out-profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was also in line with our expectations and flat year over year, with lower levels of short-term financing activity offset by higher currency-related losses. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.74. Now let's turn to segment performance. We drove solid growth in personal systems, with revenue up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency, from higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs, as we continue to take disciplined pricing actions to help mitigate increased component costs. We are focused on leading the future of work and doubling down on commercial, which represented over 70% of our PS revenue mix for the quarter. We also drove strong performance in key growth areas across AI PCs, advanced compute solutions, and hybrid systems. Aligned with our strategy, we drove commercial revenue up 10% on 6%-unit growth, with stronger pricing and mix shift towards premium, in a market that is beginning to show signs of accelerating refresh activity. However, the consumer market remained competitive, with revenue down 7% on lower volume, as a result of our strategy to rebalance our portfolio to a more profitable mix. Our operating margin in PS was 5.5%, in line with the range we guided at the beginning of the quarter, and down year-over-year from higher commodity costs that were not yet fully offset by repricing and cost initiatives. We also continued to invest in important strategic initiatives. In print, our results reflect our focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined execution. While total print revenue was down 2%, we increased our market share, with strong performance in consumer hardware. We also drove double-digit revenue growth in consumer subscriptions, and maintained momentum in industrial. By customer segment, we grew consumer 5% year-over-year on 7%-unit growth, and drove share gains with double-digit growth in big tank. In commercial, while units were flat year-over-year, revenue declined 7% in a competitive pricing environment, particularly in China, where the market remains weak. We continued our purposeful focus on profitable long-term unit growth, gaining share in the higher value categories of A4 and A3, and across all markets in the Americas and EMEA. We increased market share and drove favorable pricing and supplies, though revenue declined 1% with currency and usage headwinds. And we delivered print operating margin at the high end of our range, as expected, reflecting rigorous cost discipline in a competitive market. Now turning to our future ready plan. We have continued to drive progress, not only accelerating our initial plan, but also identifying additional initiatives to further reduce costs in our core and drive efficiencies. Given this, we are raising our cumulative gross run rate savings target from $1.6 to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal year '25. We expect restructuring charges associated with the plan to increase by approximately $150 million to $1.2 billion and anticipate approximately $400 million in charges this fiscal year as we complete the program. These incremental structural savings will be a key lever to help offset macro and geopolitical uncertainties, while also continuing to fuel investments in our key growth areas and AI innovation, all designed to position as well for long-term sustainable growth. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. As expected, our cash flow from operations was approximately $375 million in the quarter and free cash flow was $70 million. Our results reflect normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in personal systems. With regard to working capital, as part of the tariff response actions, we purposely produced additional inventory and also took advantage of strategic buy opportunities as part of overall cost mitigation. While these actions will be economically beneficial to the year, they increase our cash conversion cycle. And as we pay for and sell the increased inventory, we anticipate a further impact in cash conversion, resulting in negative free cash flow in Q2. It is important to note that these are timing impacts only and do not impact our full year outlook. Lastly, we returned close to $400 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. As we look ahead, we will continue to monitor the evolving geopolitical environment. And as Enrique mentioned, we have been focused for some time on response plans to mitigate potential adverse impacts. In both our full year and Q2 guide, we have accounted for the added cost driven by the current tariffs on China and associated mitigations, including our higher future ready cost reductions. I would note that those tariffs mostly impact our personal systems business. Though the environment ahead remains fluid, we will be focused on offsetting any additional tariffs with further leveraging the flexibility of our global supply chain network, along with cost and pricing actions as needed. We continue to expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.75. FY '25 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.86 to $3.16, including increased restructuring costs for our future ready plan. As we said at the beginning of the year, we expect EPS to be stronger in the second half, with consistent levels of sequential growth each quarter. Normal seasonal strength in personal systems, combined with the timing of the Windows 11 refresh and increased penetration of AI PCs, are catalysts that we expect to drive revenue strength in the back half of the year. And we continue to execute on our plans to offset commodity costs, including repricing efforts and cost reduction actions that are ramping and will have a more significant impact in the second half. These actions and the overall measures we are taking to deliver incremental structural cost savings from our future ready plans are expected to drive EPS improvement throughout the year, particularly in Q4. There is no change to our beginning of the year projection for print revenue to grow at least in line with the market in fiscal year '25. And we now expect personal systems to grow faster than the market, driven by share gains in commercial. Our focus on premium categories, including AI PCs, is also expected to contribute to increased levels of revenue growth in the second half. We continue to expect PS operating margins to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% range for the year, due to the actions I described earlier, as well as the sustained efforts to drive higher ASPs through the increased mix of premium products. And for print, we continue to expect our operating margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range, as we exercise disciplined cost management and execute on our future ready plans. For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.85, and GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.72. In personal systems, we expect Q2 revenues to perform better than typical seasonality, as we continue to see strength in commercials aligned with our future of work efforts. And we expect personal systems margins to remain in the lower half of the 5% to 7% range, given the timing of tariff mitigation. In print, we expect Q2 year-over-year revenue growth to be in line with full-year growth rates, and operating margins to remain near the top of our 16% to 19% range, as we continue to focus on profitable unit placement and disciplined cost management. And just to note, we expect corporate other expense to continue to be higher in Q2, though not as high as Q1, with the timing of some stock compensation expenses. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion for FY '25, with the second half of the year stronger than the first. And on capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time, as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under two times and there aren't better return opportunities. In closing, we drove solid progress in Q1 against our strategic objectives and full-year commitments, while taking action that will help us navigate through the dynamic geopolitical environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution as we continue to invest for the future, and believe we are well positioned to deliver long-term profitable growth. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joseph Cardoso: Hi, thanks for the question. This is actually Joe Cardoso on for Samik. I guess the first one here is just wondering if you can quantify the impact of the China tariff and the guidance, and how are you expecting that to trend through the year, given the mitigation efforts you outlined? And then just relative to the latter part in terms of the mitigation efforts, any color in terms of where this production may be heading in terms of essentially moving production a bit out of China, just given the outstanding tariffs currently up in the air? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Karen Parkhill: Thanks, Joe, for your question. In terms of the tariffs, as a practice, we will include the known impacts in our guide. So in both Q2 and the full-year guide, we've included the added cost driven by the current tariffs in China. And those mostly impact our PS business. I would say keep in mind roughly a third of our revenue is generated in the U.S. And as Enrique said, by the end of FY '25, less than 10% of this revenue will come from China and be subject to the tariff. We're not going to quantify, but in terms of what we're doing, we're leveraging our global supply network to mitigate this impact. We are moving production around the world to the network where we've got other places to produce. We also have got our higher future ready cost reductions that we talked about on the call that will help mitigate. And we can take pricing actions as needed.
Enrique Lores: And let me provide some additional color. This is something you have heard us talking before. After COVID, we said we needed to build a more resilient supply chain. And this is what we have done. And to do that, we have built manufacturing facilities in multiple countries, Southeast Asia, other parts of Asia, increased the capacity in other parts where we're already present. And this is, as Karen said, this is what we're doing, rebalancing supply chain. And we are now in a much longer position than we were three years ago, because we have been really putting a lot of focus on that and driving a lot of changes.
Joseph Cardoso: Now, I appreciate the color there, guys, for both of you. I guess maybe the follow-up here is just in terms of the PS growth. Obviously, you guys kind of raised your outlook here in terms of growing faster than the market. I'm just curious if you can rank order the drivers here. You talked about share gains, perhaps a little bit of pricing. Maybe there's a bit of a higher mix on the AIPCs than what you were expecting further? Just wondering if you can flesh that out a bit in terms of where the goodness is materializing for HP? And thanks for the questions.
Enrique Lores: Yes, of course. I think, first of all, we expect the market to continue to grow, especially in commercial, as we have seen during the last two quarters. And the key drivers of that, first, is the aging of the install base, second, the Windows 11 refresh, and third, to some extent, the penetration of AI PCs. This is what is driving that. Then, in this market, we are performing well. We are driving significant innovation. We have a strong sales team. And this has been driving our progress and driving the better competitive position that we have and the improvement that we have made. Of course, pricing is part of it, also because of mix. Our focus, as you know, is to grow in the most profitable premium categories. This is what we are doing, and this is impacting our results. And this will continue to impact our results through the end of the year.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Luke: Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is actually Brian Luke on for David. So, for my first one, just on Windows end of life, do you think it's becoming clearer to businesses what devices they will need as it relates to specs like optimal tops, AI-related use cases, or security? In other words, are they becoming more competent in refreshing their devices, or is the full deadline still the main driver in businesses' decisions? Then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Yes, I would say it's both. First of all, what we have seen is that there is an acceleration of the Windows 11 refresh. As I have said in previous calls, one of the key leading indicators for us is the size of the funnel and the funnel has grown significantly in the last two quarters, which tells us that customers are really much more aware and much more ready to drive the refresh. In terms of products they buy, I think they see the need to buy some of the latest generation products, both driven by the AI capabilities, but also by the new use models of PCs that more and more are used as communication tools. And this has a big influence also in the type of devices that they are buying. And in both cases, we have a leading portfolio that is showing up in the progress that we are making in this category.
Brian Luke: Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, do you have any updates on customer adoption of AI PCs? Do you still see them composing 20% of PC shipments this year and a 40% to 60% adoption rate into calendar year 2027? And then any change to the 5% to 10% premium versus traditional PCs? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes, of course. Our current expectation is that the penetration at the end of this year will be more in the 25% range, slightly higher than the 20% you mentioned. We have not changed our projection for two years from now. We continue to expect it to be between 40% and 50%. And then in terms of average selling price, our expectation continues to be that it will be at an average between 5% and 10% higher than what it is today, driven by the penetration of AI PCs.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan : Thank you so much. First one for Karen. I appreciate all the color you shared about first half versus second half seasonality. But when you look at the second half versus first half, that's a very material increase in earnings, I think 33%, which has never happened historically, despite other times when you have done restructuring. And even if you take into account the run rate, and this is at a gross level of restructuring and flow that through at some net rate that you have done historically, it just doesn't add to the full bridge. So I'm just hoping you could shed some color on which one of these drivers should we really be focused on, especially given the fact that the tariff environment still remains uncertain. And so PC uptake has also been disappointing over the last several quarters. How confident should we feel that this kind of seasonality can be achieved? And I have a follow up, please.
Karen Parkhill: Yes, thanks for the question, Wamsi. So I'm going to step back and just talk about why we're confident in our EPS guide and ramp that we talk about between the first and the second half. You know, I start with just a reminder that, you know, given the seasonality for our business, EPS is historically stronger in the second half. But specific to this year, on top of that, we expect both revenue and cost to improve in the back half. And on revenue, we expect more pronounced PS seasonality tied to the PC recovery, which includes the Windows 11 refresh and the ramp of AI PCs. We also expect continued mix shift to premium, including a higher penetration of AI PCs as we move through the year, which leads to higher ASPs. And we expect continued momentum in our growth segments that will help improve our margin profile. And in cost, we expect reduced commodity costs because we're qualifying lower cost components right now. We're also further driving consolidated volumes through strategic partners that can provide us with a cost advantage. And we've got incremental savings from our future ready plan. And then lastly, we've got a step down in our corporate other costs as we move past the first half of our year. So I'd say all of these things, along with the momentum you've seen already driving our revenue growth the last couple of quarters, give us confidence in this ramp.
Enrique Lores: Let me emphasize a couple of the comments that Karen made. I think this was the analysis that you were describing, Wamsi. There is both improvement on the revenue side and improvement on the cost side. And the combination of both is what drives us, brings us confidence in the guide that we have provided. As Karen said also at the beginning, we are including in the guide the impact of the current tariffs for China. We are not including the rest. We think it's difficult to speculate and it's hard to know exactly what the tariffs will be. So we are not including that in the guide.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks for that. Could I just ask around the tariff piece, right? So is it, could you just clarify if it's a 10% tariff that you're incorporating in China or there's some news this morning of an incremental 10%. So are you incorporating a full 20% rate at the moment? That's my clarification. And just in light of that, if you think that you will have to utilize pricing, I mean, as you have decoupled your supply chain, let's say, away from China. If other PC makers are unable to do that, would you say you would utilize pricing as a lever to take share or how should we think about that? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: First of all, as Karen said at the beginning of the call, we are including only in the guide what is official. And at this point, only the first 10% tariff increase is built into the plan. Depending on what happens, I mean, we need to see what happens now for China or other parts of the world, but we are not including that in the guide. In terms of how will we manage the situation, you know that our goal continues to be profitable growth. And we look at tariff as another area of cost. And if we have that advantage, we may use it for price. We may use it to create better profit to be able to invest in other areas. We will see how, depending how the situation goes, we will go one direction or another. Our goal for the rest of the year is to do better than the market, as Karen has explained in the guide. So our expectation is that we will be gaining share, especially in the commercial space, especially in premium.
Karen Parkhill: And I would also say, Wamsi, that with the future tariffs, we plan to use the same playbook that we have already used for the first 10% in China. So should there be more in China, we have got the playbook. Should there be more somewhere else, we are going to run that same playbook.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dylan Liu : Hi. It's actually Dylan Liu for Erik. So my question is, can you help us better understand when you expect the current commodity cycle to deflect to a tailwind to margins? And would you try to hold pricing at that time? Or would you be willing to pass those savings back to a customer at that time? And I have a follow-up after this?
Enrique Lores: Yes. For the full year, we expect commodity will continue to be a headwind for margin for the full year. But we expect to see improvements quarter over quarter starting in Q2. That's the best view that we have at this point. And again, how will we use that will depend on the competitive environment. Again, our goal is to drive profitable growth. And we will be looking at pricing and other tools depending on what the situation will be.
Dylan Liu: Got it. Thank you. And just to follow up, I want to make sure we understand your personal system comments. So last quarter, you talked about the single-digit unit growth with ASP growth layered on top of that. And is it correct to think that you're now expecting a better than mid-single-digit unit of growth? Or how material is the outperformance? You're now betting in the full-year guidance?
Karen Parkhill: Yes. I would say right now we're saying for PS that we expect to continue to gain share, particularly in commercial, and grow faster than the market.
Enrique Lores: And our expectations for the total market have not radically changed as to what we were saying a quarter ago. So no changes there.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just as a follow-up to the prior one around personal systems growth and the PC market, can you just talk about what element got better? It sounded like personal systems performance in the quarter was in line. Is the April outlook better than you had originally anticipated? Is it the back half? Any color there would be helpful.
Enrique Lores: I think it's not only the market that we expect to perform as we were saying a quarter ago. It's really the momentum that we see, and this is being translated in the results. If you look at the growth that we had this quarter on commercial of 10%, this is clearly an improvement from where we were a quarter ago. And when we look at the momentum, the progress that we've seen in the market, this gives us confidence in the projections that we have shared for the rest of the year.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you. And I wanted to follow up on the Humane acquisition and the investments in the intelligent ecosystem across HP devices. Is this a reference and an investment in workforce solutions and DEX? If you could just expand on your vision, there and the momentum that you think you can get in that piece of the business. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: I think really the impact of Humane will be beyond workforce solutions and that part of the company. When we think that this is a smart acquisition for us, we have got into the company a very talented team with a lot of experience in AI development and a great software portfolio, a great subset of software assets that we can integrate to really drive the future of work strategy. What you will see us doing is use those software assets to accelerate the deployment of AI at the edge and accelerate our plans there, and also to accelerate what we call the better together experience of having our products connecting among themselves and offering a much better and radically simpler experience to our customers. For example, one of the first areas we are going to be deploying that is in having our PCs and video conferencing rooms connecting in a seamless way, which we know is a big pain point for customers. I'm sure that all of you experience that when you have to go to a conference room. That will be the first area where we will use some of the technologies from Humane and we expect to do that in the coming quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Mike Cadiz: Good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Asiya Merchant at Citi. So, can I ask, how do you think about the PC industry growth rate for this year? Some external parties are saying maybe 4% to 5%. We at Citi are saying about 4%. And then if you layer on top of that your price increases, can one relatively safely assume that PCs can see high single digits this year?
Enrique Lores: So, the answer is yes. As I said before, our projections for the market continue to be the mid-single-digit growth for units. We haven't changed that, which is aligned with what most of the industry analysts are saying. And we expect pricing to have a positive impact on top of that. And we expect to be growing faster than the market.
Mike Cadiz: Thanks. And then as my follow-up, could you add more color and characterize PC demand across the different segments like consumer, SMB, and large enterprise, please? And that's it for me. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me provide some color. Last quarter, we saw growth both in terms of units, both growth in both the consumer and the commercial space. In the consumer space, it was more driven by low-end products, in the commercial space, it was more balanced. If I go through segments, we saw growth in the government space. We saw significant growth in the enterprise and SMB spaces. And we only saw decline in the education category. So, overall, fairly solid growth for PCs. And again, especially in the commercial, in the more premium categories.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christian Carr with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Stephen calling on behalf of Chris. My first question is regarding your print business. I guess, Enrique, like just given the ongoing strength of the U.S. dollar, I know this is sort of out of your control, but given the pricing power that some of your Japanese competitors have, do you feel like there could be a longer-term structural disadvantage that you guys have? And are you seeing any of that pricing disadvantage spill over into commercial contract pricing?
Enrique Lores: Well, we continue to see a very competitive environment on the print side, but not more competitive than what we have seen during the last few quarters. And we are not expecting it to change in the coming quarters, and this is what we're using as a planning assumption. Despite of that, and even enabled by the work that we did in cost, we grew share in the print space this quarter, especially in the home side. And our plan continues to be to drive profitable growth and really focus on the more profitable customer side as we have been during the last year.
Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for that. And for my second question, I had one for Karen regarding inventories. I just wanted to clarify for the second quarter, just given your comment earlier on negative free cash flow, I was wondering if that was implying further growth in inventories, and if so, is that more on the component side or finish gate side? Thank you.
Karen Parkhill: Yes, thanks for the question. It was not necessarily implying further growth in inventory, though we might take advantage of strategic buys like we do in any given quarter. It was really taking into account the fact that we took on extra inventory that we will pay in accounts receivable this quarter, which will impact our cash conversion cycle.
Enrique Lores: And this was one of the actions that we took to mitigate the impact of tariffs. We increased the amount of finished goods inventories in the U.S., so we could respond to tariffs, so we could protect some shipments from a tariff increase.
Karen Parkhill: And again, we said that that's not going to impact our full year free cash flow. It's a timing impact only.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for the question. Maybe to start out, I was wondering if you could just give some additional color around the competitive environment for print within China, maybe specifically around supplies and how that has potentially changed over the last few quarters?
Enrique Lores: Sure, I'll take the question. We haven't seen from a supplies competitive perspective a radical change from what we have been in China or actually anywhere else in the world. The supply business is performing well. We have been able to both to continue to grow share overall, which is one of our key plans, key strategies, as you know, and we are very pleased with the progress we are making overall.
Unidentified Analyst : Great, thanks. And maybe just as a follow-up, you mentioned some strength in consumer subscriptions. I was just wondering if you could get some extra color there.
Enrique Lores: Sure, thank you. So, yes, in terms of our key growth areas, this is one of the areas where we continue to see more solid growth. We had double-digit revenue growth this quarter. We continue to grow the number of subscribers, and we highlighted in the call that we are launching additional services, for example, paper. They also are having good traction, and we surpassed 1 million subscribers for our paper program. And as I have said before, this is a service to deliver paper at the home of our customers, and I would call it premium paper because this is really driven by convenience, not driven by price. We have also expanded the rest of the offering that we have, and in the all-in program where customers get the printer and also consumables, we have added the big tank products, which is also a strong differentiator for this category of products in the market. So we are really pleased with the progress we are making in this space. Thank you.
Operator: Our final question will come from the line of Alek Valero with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Alek Valero : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. This is Alek on Fernanda. My first question is, what kind of back-to-office assumptions have you put into your assumptions for print?
Enrique Lores: Back-to-office, I think you said. We are not assuming any radical change in terms of those assumptions and that the situation will remain fairly stable in the coming quarter.
Alek Valero: Thank you for that. As a quick follow-up, do you guys have any thoughts on the competitive landscape and AI PCs given that there's new players coming to market such as NVIDIA? Do you potentially view this as a positive for greater AI PC market adoption?
Enrique Lores: Well, we are working with NVIDIA to integrate their technology into AI PCs. NVIDIA has been, and we expect to continue to be, a key partner for us. And you will see us introducing very exciting products with their technology in the coming quarter.
Operator: That will conclude our question-and-answer session, and I'll now turn the call back over to Enrique Lores for closing remarks.
Enrique Lores: Perfect. Thank you. Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. We know it's a little bit later than other times, so really thank you for staying with us. And I just want to finish by reemphasizing some of the comments we have made today. First, we are pleased with the results that we achieved in Q1, not only from a financial perspective, but also from a competitive and from an innovation perspective. It will show the way we’re going to be going forward. Second, we are pleased with the momentum that we have in the market, and this is why we maintain the guide that we provided last quarter, despite, for example, the incremental tariff that we have seen in China. And third, when we look at the future, we are really excited about the opportunity we see in the future of work, and this is really what is driving the innovation and the plans that we have for new products and new services. Thank you again, and looking forward to talking to you again next quarter. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-26 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2024 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Lisa, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's fourth quarter 2024 earnings conference Call.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Today, we will cover our Q4 performance and 2024 full year results. We will also discuss expectations for the year ahead and how we are sharpening our strategic focus to lead the future of work. Let's start with our Q4 results. For the second consecutive quarter, revenue was up 2% year-over-year. Both Personal Systems and Print demonstrated steady progress. In Personal Systems, commercial units and share gains were strong contributors to revenue growth. In Print, we drove revenue growth for the first time in fiscal year 2021. Our growth businesses also performed well, significantly contributing to our growth in the quarter.Non-GAAP EPS grew 3% to $0.93 in line with outlook. We accelerated our future ready structural cost-saving plans, while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In short, we did what we said we would do. Q4 also capped off an exceptional year of innovation. At our annual HP Imagine event in September, we showcased breakthrough experiences and platforms with new AI powered capabilities. Our expanded AI, PC portfolio is now equipped with HP AI Companion, a bespoke application. The app uses generative AI to help analyze private files, create content or respond quickly to key tasks. Through partnerships with our growing number of software companies, we are bringing to life even more experiences for our customers. For example, we are collaborating with Zoom to power AI Companion with on-device capabilities that can streamline meeting preparation, quickly locate relevant documents and automating key tasks based on in meeting decisions. These types of experiences illustrate how powerful next gen AI compute will be in the workforce. We also launched HP Boost, a solution that allows data scientists and AI developers to share GPUs remotely. And we continue to enhance our workforce experience platform, adding the ability to monitor and manage printers and integrating popular business applications from Microsoft and ServiceNow. Our recent acquisition of Vyopta, a provider of collaboration management solutions will strengthen the platform. It will offer customers comprehensive control over their digital ecosystems from a single dashboard. In the AI PC category, we continue to lead with performance and security. We are delivering powerful experiences, industry-leading battery life and flexible form factors. Building on our consumer launches last quarter, we introduced the most powerful next-gen AI business notebook. The EliteBook X is ideal for tech experts and business consultants who run large applications for analysis. It is powered by an industry-leading 55 TOPS of NPU performance. At the same time, it offers AI enhanced protection to secure the most sensitive data. Freelancers and creators can also power their work with the Omnibook Ultra Flip, our first 2-in-1 AI PC. With it, they have the ability to design with AI, whether sketching, editing or collaborating. And with the power of HP Wolf Security, they can keep data secure and protected. Beyond the PC, we showed how we are making printing smarter with HP Print AI. It is the industry's first AI-powered intelligent print experience that simplifies and enhances printing. The perfect output feature uses AI to deliver the perfect print, solving universal frustrations like spreadsheet and tables printing over multiple pages. Our innovations this quarter underscore our commitment to delivering impactful customer driven solutions to define the future of work. Before I continue, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the incredible teams across HP delivering these experiences. Your commitment to innovate for our customers, partners and the planet is inspiring. Let me now turn to business unit performance. For the third consecutive quarter, revenue in Personal Systems was up year-over-year with 2% growth driven by strength in commercial. We saw continued pressure on commodity cost, which impacted operating profit. And we will continue to take actions on pricing and cost to mitigate this over time. We saw gains in worldwide PC market share year-over-year, particularly in high value categories, including commercial and consumer premium. We believe, there is more opportunity here and we will continue to prioritize these categories. AI PC units this quarter were more than 15% of our shipments. In fact, as recently published by Canalys, we have the number one market share of AI PC in the Windows ecosystem, and we intend to maintain this position. Looking ahead, the power of AI coupled with the strength of our portfolio will enable us to deliver new levels of efficiency and security critical to the future of work. We expect AI PC penetration to continue to further strengthen our commercial leadership. And since the Windows 11 refresh has ramped lower than previous industry transitions, we expect to see the impact of the upgrade to be more pronounced in 2025. In the growth areas, hybrid systems and PS services delivered strong performance with revenue up year-over-year. And we grew gaming revenue quarter-over-quarter, in line with normal seasonality. Turning to Print, revenue grew 1% year-over-year. The increase was fueled by strong performance in supplies and industrial graphics, offset in part by a competitive pricing environment. In both home and office, we gained share year-over-year. In home, we continue to gain share across all categories, especially in big tanks. And we delivered on our commitment to regain share in office. In growth areas, consumer services and industrial performed strongly with revenue growth year-over-year. We believe sustainability is core to our long-term growth and we continue to operate with a sense of purpose and intentionality. For example, in Q4, our HP Renew Solutions team received industry recognition for making it easier for customers to purchase high-performing refurbished hardware. We were also recognized on Newsweek's World’s Most Trustworthy Companies list. Let me now talk about the full-year performance. Revenue was flat year-over-year and non-GAAP EPS grew 3%. While the market recovery was slow, especially in the first half. We had a strong second half recovery with positive momentum going into the new fiscal year. We are pleased with our key growth areas, which collectively grew faster than the rest of the portfolio and drove approximately 20% of our total company revenue for the year. We generated strong free cash flow aligned with our annual guidance. We returned nearly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in line with our long-term commitment. Over the past year, we have continued to drive solid progress with our future ready strategy. We said we would invest in innovation, focusing our portfolio on growth and integrating new AI capabilities and we have done that. We have successfully implemented new business models as we shifted more offerings to subscriptions and solutions, increasing value per customer. We told you we were continuing to improve our operational capability. Here we have taken steps to ensure a more resilient supply chain, improve our order-to-delivery time and reduce customer call time using AI. Overall, fiscal year 2024 was a year of steady progress. We know our plans are working and we are well-positioned to capitalize on new opportunities that drive sustained growth. We are looking ahead with a clear focus on leading the future of work. With the proliferation of AI and flexible work, customer expectations have continued to evolve. Employers want to drive growth, while employees are seeking professional fulfillment. At this intersection, it's an attractive opportunity for HP. With our powerful portfolio of solutions and the right team in place, we believe we have what it takes to lead the next era. Here is how. First, we are investing and innovating aggressively in new AI-powered capabilities and software. We will focus on delivering a cutting-edge AI-powered tech stack. This is an exciting shift for our customers everywhere. It will provide them with new insights and automation, personalized experiences and foster team collaboration. Our recently established Technology and Innovation Organization, TIO brings together all our software resources into a single team. The TIO will accelerate our move from a transactional hardware company to a more experienced-led organization. Second, we are leveraging the power of our portfolio to capture growth opportunities in commercial and solution. Commercial segments are growing faster than consumer segments and we are prioritizing accordingly. In Personal Systems, for example, commercial TAM is expected to grow 3x faster than consumer. And in print, contractual office and industrial TAM are expected to perform better than consumer and transactional office. Thirdly, we are maintaining our focus on capturing profitable growth in premium consumer and gaming. For example, we are taking measures to increase growth in consumer services, building on the success of programs like our HP all in subscription plans. And in operations, we will continue to evolve our supply chain capabilities to support our future of work strategy, while ensuring supply chain resiliency, end-to-end process automation and continuous improvement in our cost structure. Looking forward to fiscal year '25, we assume that the PC market will grow faster than in fiscal year '24, fueled by multiple catalysts for refresh, including AI. And we expect the print market to decline low single-digits. We expect revenue for both Personal Systems and print to perform at least in line with the respective market. We have significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas, especially in commercial, where the market is growing faster than consumer. We also remain committed to returning approximately 100% of free cash flow over time, unless opportunities with a higher return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. We are confident our strategic focus and operational capabilities will enable us to deliver solid growth in fiscal year '25 across revenue, non-GAAP earnings and EPS and free cash flow. I will pause here and turn it over to Karen.
Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q4 with growth across both Personal Systems and print, driving a year-over-year increase in revenue for the second quarter in a row. We grew non-GAAP EPS year-over-year and delivered strong free cash flow in the quarter, solidly within our full year guidance range. And as committed, we returned nearly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. Taking a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and in constant currency. In fact, we grew in constant currency across all regions with Americas and EMEA growing 2% and APJ growing 3%. Gross margin was 21.4%, flat year-over-year, as we offset rising commodity costs with pricing and cost actions. Non-GAAP operating expenses reflect continued investment in key strategic initiatives, offset in part by cost reductions, including the acceleration of Future Ready cost savings. All in, non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion in line with our expectations. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was down year-over-year with lower currency-related losses and reduced levels of short-term financing activity. Finally, with a diluted share count of approximately 970 million shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.93 a year-over-year increase of $0.03. Now let's turn to segment performance. Personal Systems revenue was up 2% nominally and 3% in constant currency with higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs, as we continue to adjust pricing where possible to mitigate increased component costs. We outperformed the market in commercial with total units up 1% year-over-year, and we continue to see progress in key growth areas, particularly in hybrid systems that delivered strong growth for the second straight quarter. Drilling more into the details, commercial revenue was up 5% on 4% unit growth with improved pricing and favorable mix. We increased our market share with gains in high-value commercial premium. In fact, our gains in commercial more than offset continued market softness in consumer, where revenue was down 4% with units down 3%, particularly in China and as expected. Our PS operating margins were a little lower than expected, reflecting the headwinds from higher commodity costs and continued investment in strategic initiatives. Not fully offset by repricing efforts and future-ready savings. In print, our results reflected our focus on execution in a market that is showing signs of stabilization. Total print revenue increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency, driven by supplies and key growth areas. Momentum in industrial graphics continued with growth in hardware, supplies, and services. We also saw double-digit growth in consumer subscriptions revenue. By customer segment, consumer grew 3% year-over-year on 10% unit growth, with share gains across all categories. In commercial, while revenue declined 1% in a competitive pricing environment, units increased 9% with share gains across all markets except China, as we purposely focused on profitable long-term unit growth. Print operating margin of 19.6% was not only up year-over-year but above the high end of our range with favorable mix and savings from our accelerated future ready cost actions.Looking holistically at our future ready cost plans, we are pleased with the progress we made in the quarter to accelerate our actions and at this point are ahead of the plans we initially laid out. In fact, with one year to go on our three year plan, we have driven roughly 80% of our total program goal of $1.6 billion of annualized gross run rate savings. As part of Future Ready, we have modernized our data infrastructure across the company, reduced platforms and Personal Systems by over 1/3, allowing for reduced commodity complexity and driven further portfolio and resource reductions across core print. We look forward to completing these plans to drive further effectiveness and efficiency across the company in the next year. Now, let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated more than $1.6 billion in cash from operations and $1.5 billion in free cash flow and free cash flow for the fiscal year was $3.3 billion, solidly within the guidance range we set at the beginning of the year. We continue to improve our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving days payable up as a result of improving payment terms and higher manufacturing activity, and inventory days down with lower strategic buy activity. Lastly, we returned approximately $1.2 billion to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. For the year, we returned close to $3.2 billion to shareholders, nearly 100% of our free cash flow. Our Q4 and FY'24 results reflect the consistent progress we are making to drive profitable growth and maintain our leadership position in a steadily improving market. And we intend to continue this momentum into next year, as we drive further growth and investment in strategic areas, including the future of work. As we look ahead in FY'25, let me start with our segments. In Personal Systems, as Enrique said, we are aligned with industry experts, projecting the PC market to increase mid-single-digits in 2025 with the commercial market growing faster than consumer. We expect our fiscal year '25 revenue to grow at least in line with the market and to be stronger in the second half of the year, driven by normal seasonality, timing of the Windows 11 refresh and increased penetration of AI PCs. At this point, we anticipate AI PCs will make up approximately 25% of our PC unit shipments in FY'25. On operating margins, we expect to be in the upper half of our 5% to 7% range for the year, but to remain in the lower half in Q1, given continued pressure on our commodity costs. And while we have put in place cost reduction and pricing actions to offset these pressures, they will take time and will ramp through the year, leading to stronger margins expected in the second half. In Print, we expect to perform at least in line with the overall market. And as Enrique said, we are aligned with industry experts projecting the overall market to decrease low single-digits in 2025. We expect the pricing environment to stabilize and our ASPs to benefit from our focus on driving profitable share gains in strategic categories. Particularly in office, we see the opportunity to capture share in the contractual segment, where we are under indexed. We expect supplies revenue to decline low to mid-single-digits in FY'25 in constant currency, consistent with our long-term outlook. And we expect our operating margin to continue to be near the top of our 16% to 19% long-term range, including in Q1, as we continue to exercise disciplined cost management and execute on our Future Ready plans. Beyond the segment, we expect Corporate Other to be relatively flat year-over-year at approximately $1 billion. Keep in mind that due to the timing of our stock compensation expense, we expect approximately one-third of our annual corporate other expense in Q1. With all of this, we expect FY'25 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.75 and FY'25 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.36. For Q1, we expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.76 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.63. Overall, we expect EPS to be stronger in the second half with sequential improvements in each quarter. On FY’25 free cash flow, we expect to deliver between $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion with growth in line with earnings. As typical, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first. Consistent with our net earnings and recognizing that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of our prior year incentive comp payment. On capital allocation, we remain committed to returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x and there aren't better return opportunities. In closing, we are excited for our future and also pleased to announce today that we are raising our annual dividend by 5% to $1.16 per share. This is the ninth consecutive annual increase since our separation in 2015, and reflects the confidence we and our Board have in our long-term outlook ahead. With that, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan, Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you so much. Your -- typically your first quarter EPS is about 25% of the full year. This year you're guiding to EPS that's closer to 20%. Can you talk about some of the puts and takes over there? I know you called out the timing of stock comp. But is there anything else that's driving the delta over there as well? And I have a follow-up.
Karen Parkhill: Yes. Thanks for the question, Wamsi. In our Q1, EPS is typically down sequentially. So keep in mind, we have seasonal volume declines in the first quarter. And yes, we do have a sequential increase in corporate other expense in the quarter and that's really driven by the timing of our stock compensation expense. I said we expect roughly 1/3 of it to hit in Q1.
Wamsi Mohan: I guess my follow-up is really around your Future Ready transformation plan where you've done a lot of cost optimization already. But when we look at the EPS guide for next year, presumably most of that's really coming from share buybacks, which would mean that your organic operating income is roughly flat despite all these cost optimizations. Why should we not see a higher improvement in free cash flow next year? Especially as you're starting to expect PCs to grow and you're also lapping some of these restructuring charge, the magnitude at least is going down on restructuring charges as well. So, why isn't free cash somewhat materially higher range closer to a couple of years ago?
Karen Parkhill: Yes. We're pleased with the free cash flow we delivered this fiscal year and we do expect it to continue to grow roughly in line with earnings. We intend to drive continued improvement in working capital and free cash flow just as we have in the past few years. We expect that to continue. And as we enter the third year of our Future Ready cost plan, we expect to spend a little less on restructuring charges, but we will offset with some slightly higher capital expenditures to support our growth plans. But again, we expect free cash flow to grow roughly in line with earnings.
Enrique Lores: And also another comment about your first observation, when we look at EPS growth year-on-year, it's driven both by share buybacks but we are also expecting growth of operating profit and this is really what is supporting the midpoint of the guide.
Operator: The next question is from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
Erik Woodring: Awesome. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Enrique or Karen, I guess maybe Karen this one would be for you. You've done 19% print operating margins effectively three years in a row now, all in years in which revenue – print revenue has been down low to mid-single-digits. So maybe my question is why is 16% to 19% the correct range and why wouldn't it be higher or has there been a degree of over earning that at some point should normalize in the future? I'm just trying to understand the relative outperformance versus the target. And then I have a follow-up.
Karen Parkhill: Yes, thanks for the question. You've seen us operate at this high end of the range both in Q4 and the full year, and we do expect that to continue in FY'25. We are focused on protecting our profitability in print. We've been reducing unprofitable units through our shift to Big Tank. We've also been increasing the lifetime customer profitability with growth in our subscription business and we're gaining share in some of the higher value categories in office. As we think about the guide, the range going forward, we're maintaining the lower end of the range, just so we can have flexibility to lean in where we find opportunity. But we're also going to remain cognizant of the dynamic market conditions that we've seen in recent years.
Enrique Lores: And Erik, this is very consistent with previous conversations. As Karen just said, we want to have flexibility to lean in in case we see opportunity to place more positive hardware units. And if we do see the opportunity, we're going to have that and this may put some pressure on the margin on specific quarter. But nothing has changed from previous conversations.
Erik Woodring: Right. Okay. Very fair. Thank you, guys. And then my follow-up. Enrique, after a strong 4Q in which you gained share in both print and PCs, can you maybe just help us understand maybe why you don't expect to gain share next year talking about growing in line with the market? Is there any kind of competitive pressures that are rising maybe from, for example, where the yen is today, or are you just trying to be a bit more conservative in setting expectations so early in the year? And that's it for me.
Enrique Lores: I would say it's more the latter. Erik, we want to be conservative in the assumptions. Of course, our goal is going to be to grow share. But as we always say, grow share in profitable categories. Our goal is not to grow share for the sake of growing share. It's really about focusing on those areas, where we see opportunity to do it in a profitable way. This year we have grown share in PCs, especially in commercial. And as we have said during the prepared remarks, commercial is going to continue to be our priority.
Operator: Up next, we'll take a question from Amit Daryanani, Evercore ISI.
Irvin Liu: Hi. Thank you. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I have one and a follow-up as well. So if I heard correctly, AI PC units were 15% of shipments during your fiscal Q4 and expected to expand to 25% next year. As this mix expands, what sort of implications will this have for all - AI PCs have for ASPs and your PS margins?
Enrique Lores : Yes. We have not changed our view on the impact that AI PCs are going to have and current results support the assumptions that we have seen. The AI PCs are going to drive an improvement of average selling price. What we have been saying until now when we confirm is three years from now, we expect them to be between 40% and 60% of the mix and half around between a 5% and a 10% impact on the overall category. That’s the direction that we are taking and the current shipments and pricing supports what we have seen until now.
Irvin Liu: Got it. And then for my follow-up, with the upcoming change in administration and potential for tariffs, can you just talk about how you are positioned to mitigate any potential impacts to your supply chain?
Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you. And first, let me say that we are really willing to collaborate with the new administration to reach the best solution for both our customers and our shareholders. If you think about what we've been talking about in the last few years, we have done a lot of work to make our supply chain footprint more resilient and we have been building factories in different parts of the world to be able to respond to changes in the geopolitical environment. So today, we're in a much stronger position than we were three years ago. We think that compared to other companies in our industry, we are in a strong position. At this point, it's hard to know what exactly the new tariffs are going to be. What I can say is we have a strong team that knows how to manage this type of environment. And as we know what the final policies will be, we will build best plan for the company.
Operator: Our next question today will come from Toni Sacconaghi, Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi : I just wanted to follow-up on the last question first. My understanding is outside of inkjet printer cartridges, essentially everything HP makes is outside of the country and imported. So, if we did have a tariff on all incoming goods, which is sort of the current statement from the administration. How does HP respond to that? I understand you may have less time exposure, but you're still making essentially all of your products aside from inkjet cartridges, I believe, outside the U.S. So how would you address a global tariff on imported goods specifically?
Enrique Lores : We have said Toni at this point, we don't want to speculate on what the final tariffs are going to be. We will respond to whatever the final decisions are and actively manage our supply chain to do that. You are correct, we have a small percentage of production today in the U.S. is a bit broader than the inkjet cartridges, but as you said, we produce most of our products outside the US.
Toni Sacconaghi : Okay. And if I could follow-up, maybe you could just describe what's your Mexico exposure because there actually has been a policy statement on that. So what is your Mexico exposure? And then, as my follow-up, Enrique or Karen, as we look forward to next year, it sounds like you're expecting supplies to decline 3%, 4% low single-digits, but potentially the printing business to grow, which would mean that hardware would be positive. Why would that shift not pressure margins? And what's the offset to keep margins at the high end of the range?
Enrique Lores : Let me take both questions, Toni. First of all, on Mexico, we don't disclose the specific percentage of products that we get from them. So I will defer the answer to that question. In terms of print, what we have said is in fiscal year '25, we expect the market to decline and this should be consistent to what you see also from the HP perspective, our goal is to do at least as well as market, but we are going to see some pressure on revenue from the print perspective. And as you said, our guide, our expectation is that supply is consistently with what we have been saying in the past will continue to decline low to mid-single digits or no change in our view on that.
Operator: Your next question will come from Samik Chatterjee, JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee : I guess for the first one, if I can go to the outlook that you shared for the PC market. I think you said commercial in particular, growing higher than mid-single digit. I know that's sort of the consensus right now in the industry analysts, but just curious how you sort of thinking about that outcome sort of playing out in terms of the confidence in enterprises sort of refreshing ahead of that deadline in terms of Windows end of life, but particularly given that we've all been a bit surprised that enterprises haven't refreshed as much this year. How are you thinking about sort of the validity of that growth expectation as well as the likelihood that they don't really deprioritize when they're investing towards AI infrastructure, they don't end up deprioritizing PCs as a part of that spending sort of overall bucket that they're looking at. And I have a follow-up as well.
Enrique Lores : Yes. So I think, first of all, if we look at what has happened in Q4, we have seen revenue growth in the commercial space of 5% and unit growth of 4%. So we are already at a fairly significant growth in the commercial PC space. And when we think about next year, first of all, we think that the fact that the winter retrench has started in a slower way than previous transitions as we shared last quarter, just makes the opportunity in '25 bigger because there is a deadline in the fall next year where support costs for Windows 10 is going to significantly, significantly increase and therefore, company will have a strong incentive to change. On top of that, we continue to have an aged installed base that needs to be refreshed, which has been driving the growth that we have seen in Q4. And we -- the mix of AI PCs will continue to grow, which also is going to create a tailwind for the business. But these are the key assumptions that we have. And on top of that, as we have done this year, we will continue to prioritize premium categories we have been growing share and this continues to be the goal for us as a company.
Samik Chatterjee : Got it. And for my follow-up, I mean, Karen, maybe this is for you, just going back to Wamsi's earlier question on this. What's driving the seasonality for earnings in 1Q? I understand the sort of drivers that are impacting earnings, but are you expecting anything different from a typical seasonality when it comes to the revenue outcomes for the quarter as well. If you can just clarify that.
Karen Parkhill : Yes. So for revenue, we're expecting growth both year-over-year in the quarter and for the full year at the total company level with strength in PS offsetting a likely decline in print. In terms of just our ramp through the year on EPS, we said that we expect a stronger second half and that Q1 should be our lowest quarter with improvement throughout the year. And I would say the main drivers of that are more pronounced PS revenue seasonality tied to the PC recovery along with the actions that we're taking to improve PS margins in the back half. And as we already mentioned, we expect that step down in corporate other costs as we move past Q1. And I would say, lastly, we're also expecting this higher penetration of AI PC models as we move through the year. So those, along with our growth segments really drive an improvement to our margin profile.
Enrique Lores : And let me add a comment on cost. As we shared in the prepared remarks, we have seen pressure from commodity costs in Q4. We expect that this pressure will continue in Q1 but that through the year to repricing and through additional cost that we are -- actions that we are taking to qualify lower components to concentrate volumes in a few specific SKUs, we will be able to compensate for that. And this also creates an improvement quarter-on-quarter that is what is supporting the guidance.
Operator: The next question will come Asiya Merchant Citi.
Asiya Merchant : If I can just double click on your growth services. I think it was 20%, and I believe you said it grew mid-single digits. How should we think about the expectations for these growth businesses to perform into next year? What are some of the drivers that would potentially accelerate growth here? Because I think at the analyst event, you guys did share higher growth actions. And if you could talk about some of the drivers for the growth business.
Enrique Lores : Yes. Thank you. So it's early work that we talked about a few of them to explain and what are the expectations that we have for next year. But the overall is that they will continue to grow faster than the overall company, which is why for us are very important going forward. If we think, for example, about growth that we expect in consumer services, we expect the number of subscribers to continue to grow. And also, we are expanding the portfolio of services that we offer. During this year, we offered a print as a service program. We offer the all-in program, and we will see the adoption of these two programs to continue to increase. We also have seen solid growth, especially in the second half on our Workforce Solutions portfolio, especially in the print as a service devices a service and conference room as a service and we expect these businesses to continue their growth next year. We have a strong second half on hybrid systems, but the market -- commercial recovers we see growth in the category and we expect it to continue to grow in '25. Most of them, we see opportunity to grow driven by the market and also driven by the innovation that we are going to continue to bring to market across many categories. This is why, for us, going forward, we see this strong opportunity in commercial in redefining the future of work, which is basically integrating AI into our full portfolio and allowing customers from an enterprise perspective to drive productivity and from an employee perspective to increase the fulfillment that they get with the activities they do. And this is going to be more and more the overall focus of the company.
Operator: We'll take the next question from Krish Sankar, TD Cowen.
Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one, Enrique, thanks for your color on next year and AI PC and all the good stuff. I'm kind of curious, what exactly is the definition of AI PC? Does it have a higher silicon content like NPU, CPU memory? How do you describe AI PC because it was 15% of last quarter mix? And if there is a higher silicon content, what is the bond cost impact to margins? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores : Sure. So when we talk about the 15%, we view the official definition that IDC is using, which are PCs that have an NPU built-in. And this is what we are using for 15% to be consistent with the rest of the industry. Our focus really is more in what we call next-generation AI PCs that are defined by, first, being a stronger more powerful NPU of above 40 tops. Second, of being able to run what we call our AI companion, which is our own model designed to accelerate productivity in the office when running at the edge. And third, especially in the commercial space, PCs that have enhanced security capabilities because of having the NPU and some of the software and models that we are building into them. This next gen AI PC, we just started to ship during Q4. So the impact they have had this year is limited, but what made them very exciting is we have been able to give them to software companies to start developing new solutions. We displayed some of them in our margin event and the impact in productivity that they are going to have is very significant. But if you ask me how confident I am about the impact the AI PCs are going to have is even more than before because I have seen them in action. I see the opportunity that they bring, and I think it's going to be a very, very strong part of our portfolio in the coming years.
Krish Sankar : Got it. Very helpful. Enrique for the clarification too. And one other quick follow-up. You mentioned that commodity cost pressure is going to be there into the early part of next year. Typically, what is the lag effect you see? Because the reason I'm asking is that if you look at most forecasts, memory, DRAM and NAND, which is a big part of your commodity cost is expected to decline in calendar Q1. If that is true, when do you see the benefit of that?
Enrique Lores : Yes. We expect to continue to see pressure from commodity costs through the first half of our fiscal year. So our calendar Q4 and calendar Q1 and then this to be mitigated in the second half of the year, especially because of all the work that we are doing first on repricing. We did repricing in Q4. We will continue to do that, but there is always a difference in time between cost increases and price increases. But over time, this gets compensated. And also, as I mentioned before, the work that we are doing from a cost perspective to qualify lower components to integrate or to increase the volume on some specific SKUs, simplifying our offering so we can buy more of a single component. The three actions should help us to mitigate the impact in the second half of our fiscal year.
Karen Parkhill : And I would just add, Chris that our strategic buys helped us when commodity cost pressures first started. And now we're working on repricing and cost-down actions. It just takes time to take hold.
Operator: Up next is David Vogt, UBS.
David Vogt : The first one is maybe Enrique on print. I just want to go back to the competitive landscape because the yen has been such a headwind for so long. It doesn't sound like you were that concerned or that impacted this quarter. Kind of what's going on in that margin? How does that play out into fiscal '25? And then I'll give you my second question at the same time. So given sort of the improvement that you're thinking about in the top line next year and the really strong margins in print, given the Future Ready plan, any thought to why the capital return policy still fixates around sort of cross leverage at 2 turns, given the structural margin improvement that you've made in the print business despite the revenue decline. And I'll just turn it back.
Enrique Lores : I'll take the first one, and then Karen will take the second. In terms of competitive environment in print, we have not seen a significant change. We continue to see our Japanese competitors taking strong advantage of the weakness of the yen and the ratio has not changed. What has changed is that during the last two quarters, as we announced at the beginning of the year, we have been working to aggressively reduce the cost of our products so we could compete more aggressively and we have started to gain share, both in home and in office. But it's not so much a result of the competitive environment getting easier, is really a consequence of all the work that we are doing as part of our Future-Ready plan as you said.
Karen Parkhill : And just on the cap allocation policy, returning capital to shareholders is a priority for us. And our capital allocation policy has not changed, where we still expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow over the long-term as long as higher ROI opportunities aren't there, and we maintain our leverage ratio of 2x, just under 2x. On the leverage ratio, we do evaluate it every year. And our analysis continues to indicate that this is the optimal level for us. And it's aligned with the credit rating that is also aligned with our peers and provides us ample access to short-term liquidity.
Operator: Next question is Michael Ng, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Ng: I just have two as well. Just a follow-up on David's question regarding print. It was great to hear that you're working to reduce the cost and price of your products, you see it in the unit growth this quarter. I was wondering if you expect to see continued unit growth as we head into next year as a result of some of your price actions. And then, I'll give you the second one as well. Just on the PC refresh, it's widely understood that this October 2025 is a hard deadline. I was just wondering, in prior cycles, have you seen enterprises do much by way of extended support? Or does that not really kind of impacting at all?
Enrique Lores : In terms of print, our expectation is that next year market is going to slightly decline. And this is our expectation and also the expectations from most of the industry analysts. Our goal is going to continue to grow share if units are profitable at the system level. So this continues to be our goal. But at this point, it's hard to predict exactly how competitors are going to be responding. Of course, we are going to maintain our effort to continue to reduce costs as we always do. And then in terms of the PC refresh, what we have seen previously is the companies respond to the deadline. And this is why we are saying that we expect this to accelerate through 2025, given that compared to previous refreshes, the refresh is going a little bit slower. And this is why in '25 and especially in the second half, we expect an improvement for a further improvement of commercial demand driven by this transition.
Operator: Next up, we'll take a question from Ananda Baruah, Loop Capital Markets.
Ananda Baruah : Appreciate it. I guess Enrique sticking with print and market decline, can you give us a sense of what you're thinking for commercial relative to consumer? I'll get up to here. Commercial decline drove the consumer decline. And on the commercial side, what are the trends -- what are the sort of dynamics that are informing the market as you can best see them? How much is macro? How much it back off is anecdotally. And then so how much is, call it, maybe shift to digital and other things?
Enrique Lores : Okay. Ananda, let me provide some color. So we -- when we look at the different segments in print, we expect that in '25, consumer will continue to decline. So no change from what we have seen. In the other side, we see two dynamics. We see traction that we expect that will decline. But we see what we call contractual office where Managed Print Services is part of it that will have a better performance than transactional. And when we think about areas to focus for us, clearly, this is an opportunity because the market will perform better and also because our share is lower than in other segments, you should expect us to really go after that category. And then finally, we expect to continue to see growth in the industrial space. We saw strong growth in the second half of this year, and we expect to continue to see that in '25.
Operator: Next up is Aaron Rakers, Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers : I'm going to throw two of them out right away. So I guess as we kind of start to focus or definitely shift our focus to the Windows upgrade cycle looking into next year. I'm curious, as you guys think about the market opportunity, any of the data that you look at just sizing how large this AI are, this Windows installed base -- aged installed base looks to be as we think about that going forward? And then I just want to be clear, like if you look at the PC market, my second question, if you look at your PC growth estimate of mid-single digits, I think that more or less is in line with where industry shipment expectations are? Why would we not see some ASP benefit from these AI PCs on top of that unit growth as we look into next year? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that.
Enrique Lores : Sure. The first part of your question, the answer is definitely yes. We have a lot of analytics that support the opportunity about the refresh analytics that we have and also analytics at Microsoft has and that we share because we -- it's a common interest for both companies to drive. And this is what helps us to assess how much conversion has happened and how much opportunity we have going forward. In terms of ASP help from the PC side, we have seen for this year, we have seen revenue growth above unit growth and we expect a similar phenomenon to happen in '25. And this is part of the guide and that we have provided today.
Karen Parkhill : Yes, we do expect that we will benefit from ASP growth next year and in the first quarter, and that's really just given the enhancement of premium offerings, including the richer mix of AI PCs.
Operator: And everyone, at this time, there are no further questions.
Enrique Lores : Perfect. Thank you, everybody for joining today's call. I know it's a bit later than other calls, especially for those of you in the East Coast. So thank you for being here. As you have heard, we are very optimistic about the plan that we have in '25. The company -- our expectation is that the company will be growing both revenue and operating profit. And going forward, we see a strong opportunity in defining the future of work, in helping companies to drive productivity improvement and helping employees to get more fulfillment from their work. A very exciting opportunity that is going to be driving the priorities that we use going forward. So again, thank you for joining today. And for those of you in the U.S., we wish you a very happy Thanksgiving Day. Thank you.
Operator: Once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-08-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Hello. Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2024 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Desiree and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be on listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recoded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go-ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; Karen Parkhill, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Tim Brown, who is the Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations webpage at investor.hp.com.

We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier-1 channel inventory. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me start by welcoming our new CFO, Karen Parkhill, who joined HP earlier this month. Her expertise and background are a great addition to our leadership team and we are delighted to have her on board. And a big thank you to Tim Brown for stepping in as Interim CFO over the last three quarters. Today, I will cover our third-quarter results, a few of the new innovative experiences we have introduced, how we are tracking against our strategic priorities, and our expectations for Q4. Karen will provide additional details on our financials and outlook. Starting with our results, let me first focus on revenue. I am pleased to share we are building solid momentum. The company returned to revenue growth for the first time in nine quarters, up 2% year-over-year. This was driven by strong performance in Personal Systems in our key growth areas. Commercial PC recovery was strong, in line with our expectations and a signal of ongoing market stabilization. That said, the recovery of the print market was slower than expected, which impacted print revenue. Non-GAAP operating profit was down 7% and non-GAAP EPS was within our previously provided outlook range, but below our expectations. We have been taking decisive actions to address this. We see an immediate opportunity to drive additional structural cost savings in Q4 as part of our Future Ready program. We are accelerating our plan raising our exit goal for fiscal year 2024. We expect to reach 80% of the three-year structural cost run-rate target by the end of this year. We will also keep executing our plan to strengthen momentum and drive long-term profitable growth. This includes investments in support of our growth businesses. And these combined efforts will help us win in the market, drive profitable growth, and build a stronger HP. Turning to new innovations, Q3 was another strong quarter. We continue to deliver industry-leading experiences by putting our customers at the center of everything we do. In the AI PC category, we are charging ahead. Our next-gen AI PCs are empowering everyone from knowledge workers to data scientists to unlock the power of AI. In May, we launched our first generation using the latest Qualcomm processor. As the world's thinnest next-gen AI PCs with the longest battery life, they are made for mobility. And in July, we introduced a new premium model powered by the latest AMD processor. It is the most powerful AI PC in the industry with up to 55 TOPS of NPU performance. It delivers personalized experiences like real-time translation, personal communication coaching, and quick professional video creation and to help protect against AI-assisted cyber-attacks, the new OmniBook Ultra includes the industry-leading protections and capabilities of HP Wolf Security. We are doing even more to raise the bar for data scientists and AI developers. Our HP AI studio is the world's most comprehensive workstation solution for AI development, in Q3, we made it even stronger by being the first and only to build Gen AI trust into our solution. This means developers can more effectively detect, correct, and monitor inaccurate outputs from AI models, making it faster and safer for companies to deploy AI-powered applications. In Workforce Solutions, our proprietary workforce experience platform is exceeding our expectations. Customers are now leveraging our AI capabilities to manage over 250,000 devices and growing. We also recently added several managed devices wins and deployments, including larger companies like Eaton. Our continued partnership with this global intelligent power management company will help support their IT journey in serving more than 90,000 employees around the world. We set a new standard for industrial printing at DRUPA, introducing advanced digital presses and intelligent automation solutions. This included autonomous mobile robots that save up to two hours of production a day per press. We also enhanced our print OS platform, giving customers the ability to monitor their entire production floor from jobs mission to delivery. We were honored to take home more best of awards than any other exhibitor at the show. We also announced a new partnership with Canva. Their 185 million monthly users can now similarly design and create online and print locally. We also secured major deals with print and digital industry leaders like RR Donnelly, All4Labels and SYNTHES. We are excited about what's ahead. In September, we will host our second annual HP Imagine event. Here, we will unveil even more new experiences that help our customers drive growth and professional fulfillment. In Q3, we further invested in our long-term success. We acquired Cybercore Technologies, a leading provider of secure supply-chain management and cyber solutions for the US Federal Government. The addition of Cybercore to the HP family will help further strengthen our security expertise and enhance our offerings. And just yesterday, we announced we have received a $50 million award from the US Department of Commerce. This funding from the CHIPS and Science Act will help modernize and expand our microfluidics semiconductor fab in Corvallis, Oregon. It will also help us further explore the potential of our microfluidics technology in new areas such as life sciences. In Q3, we released our Annual Sustainable Impact Report, highlighting the important progress we have made. In 2023, our initiatives helped us reach a 27% reduction in value-chain greenhouse gas emissions. We continue to roll-out easily recyclable packaging created from recycled content. In 2023, we've reached a 62% reduction in single-use plastic packaging. And our digital equity efforts have reached 45 million people since 2021. We know there is always more that can be done, but we are proud of our progress. And we are honored to be ranked first in our industry on Time Magazine's World's Most Sustainable Companies list. Now let me share more details on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Personal Systems, revenue was up 5% year-over-year, the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Operating profit was 6.4%, in line with our expectations. Globally, our PC share was flat year-over-year, but up 1.3 points quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by growth in high-value categories, including workstations and consumer premium. We continue to see strong progress in key growth areas with revenue up year-over-year in Personal Systems Services and in Hybrid Systems, driven by strong demand for video collaboration. And we grew gaming revenue quarter-over-quarter in line with normal seasonality. We remain very excited about the AI PCs opportunity. Shipments are ramping and initial reactions are overwhelmingly positive. We have a strong portfolio with an unprecedented level of HP engineering. Our growing ecosystem of developers and AI software providers are a huge competitive advantage. Forbes declared HP owns the AI PC crown and they are right. Our focus is on delivering new AI experiences for our customers. Overall, our AI PC expectations across shipments, higher ASPs and premium mix remains on track with our expectations for the second half. Shifting to Print, net revenue was down 3% year-over-year. We delivered print operating profit of 17.3%, which was below our expectations. We saw a softer demand, unfavorable geo mix, and a more aggressive pricing environment. Even in this type of challenging environment, I expect us to do better. And as I said earlier, we are taking actions to accelerate our structural cost-savings for this year. We have made progress on gaining profitable share with growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in home, and in office when excluding China. We gained share in our strategic areas, especially a big thanks, A3 and A4 value. Key growth areas in print continue to make progress. Consumer services revenue and subscribers grew year-over-year. Industrial graphics did as well and we have strong momentum coming out of DRUPA. And supplies continued to perform as expected., overall, we generated strong free-cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter and returned $0.9 billion to shareholders. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Our Board of Directors urged us to increase the total share repurchase authorization to $10 billion. This reaffirms our commitment to deliver strong and sustained capital returns to our shareholders. Looking forward to Q4, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our markets will continue to be competitive. We expect the PC commercial momentum to continue and our key growth areas to make progress. At the same time, the competitive pricing environment will remain in Q4 and the print market recovery will continue to be slower. As a result, we decided to moderate our expectations for Q4 and the full year. We will maintain investments and progress in high-value and key growth areas and accelerate our cost-reduction plans. We are confident in our strategy and well-equipped to drive meaningful progress as we round out fiscal year 2024. Across our entire portfolio, leveraging AI and enabling hybrid work experiences will remain central to creating solutions that deliver growth and fulfillment for all HP customers. I will pause here and turn it over to Karen.
Karen Parkhill: Thank you, Enrique, for the warm welcome. I'm thrilled to join HP, and I'm eager to meet you, our analysts, and investors in the months ahead. Though I've been here just a few weeks, I'm incredibly impressed by the innovation all around me. HP is an iconic company and I'm excited to work with Enrique and our leadership team to create an even stronger future ahead. Building upon our market-leading portfolio, attractive growth businesses, and culture keenly focused on delivering value for our shareholders. Now, on to the quarter. Starting high level, we are building on the progress we made in the first half. And as Enrique said, are pleased with our return to revenue growth for the first time in nine quarters. Solid performance in Personal Systems, which grew for the second quarter in a row and in our key growth areas drove our Q3 revenue growth. And double-digit sequential growth in Personal Systems drove strong free-cash flow in the quarter. We also returned nearly $870 million to our shareholders through repurchases and dividends and remain focused on returning approximately 100% of our free cash flow this fiscal year. Looking across the company, the print market was softer than we expected at the beginning of the quarter. And both print and PS saw a dynamic pricing environment that put some pressure on our margins as did our focus on continuing to invest for long-term sustainable growth. As a result and as Enrique mentioned, we are accelerating our Future Ready plan and intend to deliver savings sooner than expected. As a reminder, our plan incorporated our goal to deliver gross annualized structural cost-savings of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025, with approximately 70% or $1.1 billion achieved by the time we exit the fiscal year. Given our focus to mitigate near-term market challenges and just as importantly, maintain investments to drive longer-term growth, we have accelerated our efforts and now expect our cumulative savings target exiting the fiscal year to be approximately $1.3 billion or 80% of the planned target. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was up 2% nominally and up 3% in constant currency. In constant currency, revenue increased in all regions with Americas, EMEA and APJ each growing 3%. Gross margin at 21.5% in the quarter was up slightly year-over-year. Our cost-saving efforts offset both competitive pricing in the face of rising commodity costs and a mix-shift given the strong PS performance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up year-over-year from continued investment in key initiatives and our people. And of course, we continue to drive cost reductions, including the Future Ready cost-savings. All-in non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Below the op profit line, non-GAAP net OI&E was down year-over-year, benefiting from less short-term financing activity and lower interest expense from the debt tender we completed last year. Finally, with a diluted share count of roughly 1 billion shares, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83, a year-over-year decrease of $0.03 and GAAP-diluted net earnings per share was $0.65. Now let's turn to segment performance. Personal Systems revenue was up 5%, both nominally and in constant currency. With higher commercial volumes and increased ASPs as we worked to adjust pricing where possible to mitigate increased commodity costs. Total units were up 1% year-over-year with strength in commercial. And sequentially, revenue was up 11% and units were up 14% with seasonal strength and overall share gains. Of note, hybrid systems revenue grew in the double-digits year-over-year, including strong growth in video collaboration. Drilling more into the details, consumer revenue was down 1% with units down 6% and commercial revenue was up 8% on 6% unit growth. Improved pricing in consumer, along with a favorable commercial mix and a shift to premium consistent with our strategy drove higher overall ASPs. In fact, we continue to see commercial representing greater than 70% of personal systems revenue. And while calendar Q2 market share was flat year-over-year, we gained share sequentially, driving improvements in high-value categories. And of course, we remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Personal Systems operating margin of 6.4% was down slightly year-over-year. We had higher commodity costs and purposely continued our strategic investment, offset in part by Future Ready savings. In print, our results reflected the slower pace of market recovery and an incrementally aggressive pricing environment as our Japanese competitors continued to benefit from the weaker yen. Overall, the market came in below expectations, particularly in China. Total print revenue was down 3% on a reported basis and 2% in constant currency. And while hardware units declined 2% year-over-year, total print market share increased both year-over-year and sequentially. And momentum in industrial graphics continued with supplies and services driving the fourth straight quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 5% with units down 4%. And as mentioned, we felt the impact of market declines, most notably in China and competitive pricing. Consumer revenue returned to growth, increasing 2% on flat units with favorable mix offsetting pricing. Of note, hardware units grew 5% sequentially, driven by strength in consumer and supplies revenue was down 2% nominally and 1% in constant currency, in-line with our outlook. Print operating margin of 17.3% was down year over year with headwinds from pricing and increased investments, not fully offset by savings from our Future Ready actions. On our Future Ready transformation plan, we continue to drive greater effectiveness and efficiency across the company. For example, we're using generative AI capabilities to reduce customer call times in workforce solutions. And in our commercial organization, our move to more end-to-end processes is enabling much faster deal quotes for contractual customers and allowing customers to more easily buy and renew on hp.com. There is more to come as we accelerate and complete this program, particularly in print, where we are driving further reductions across the core, including business consolidation, supply-chain optimization, and reductions in platforms. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocations. We generated more than $1.4 billion in cash from operations and $1.3 billion in free cash flow. We continued to improve our cash conversion cycle this quarter, driving inventory days down with seasonally higher volumes in Personal Systems, offset in part by an increase in strategic buys as we focused on reducing the near-term impact of rising commodity costs. Lastly, we returned close to $870 million to shareholders through both share repurchase and dividends and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. Just as a reminder, unless higher ROI opportunities arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times, we expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders over time. Looking forward to the fourth quarter and our fiscal year-end, we will continue to navigate a dynamic environment and have therefore modeled multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. In Personal Systems, we expect Q4 revenue to increase sequentially low to mid-single digits. We are expecting continued strength in commercial, but given the lingering softness in the consumer market, we are expecting less seasonal growth than we have seen historically. We anticipate Personal Systems operating margin to remain in the upper half of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q4. As we work to offset increased commodity costs through pricing and disciplined cost management, while continuing to invest in strategic priorities. In print, we see improving trends in the market, but the pace of recovery is slower than we expected with continued competitive pricing pressure. For Q4, we expect print revenue to increase low-to mid-single digits sequentially, driven by typical seasonal strengths as well as strong momentum in our industrial business coming out of DRUPA. We expect supplies revenue in FY 2024 to decline low-single digits. And we anticipate Q4 print margins to be near the top of our 16% to 19% range, given seasonal strength and acceleration of Future Ready cost-savings. Taking all of these considerations into account, we are moderating our guide for Q4 and fiscal year 2024 and we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.01, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We expect fourth-quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.99 and fourth-quarter GAAP-diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.84. For the full-year, we now expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. And FY 2024 GAAP-diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.62 to $2.72. Lastly, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY 2024. As a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. At this point, we want to open the lines for your questions. But before we do, I want to express my gratitude to my HP colleagues for their help in making my onboarding as smooth as possible. And in particular, I want to thank Tim Brown for his leadership in the interim and his continued help these past few weeks with me. Tim is also on the call with Enrique and me to help answer your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes, hi. This is Andrew for David. Wanted to ask about the print margins in fiscal 2024. Can you disaggregate some of the pressure you saw in this quarter? What was the -- what were the primary drivers, what were the bigger drivers? And why do you expect that to reverse next quarter? Is it entirely on the cost cuts from the Future Ready plan or are there other drivers that you're expecting to improve margins in Q4? Thanks.
Karen Parkhill: Thanks for your question, Andrew. Our Q3 print margin was below our expectations, although I would note that supplies did come in as expected in the quarter. So our margin was impacted by more aggressive pricing as we talked about, as well as a challenging market environment, particularly in China. And that was driving unfavorable geographic mix. And against that environment, we took the opportunity to place hardware units that are profitable long-term but dilutive to the current overall margin rates. And despite the headwinds, we also maintained our investment in the key growth areas that are going to generate long-term value. And then as we look ahead to Q4, we expect to be seasonally stronger on revenue. We're also, as we talked about taking more aggressive actions to drive that margin improvement. We said we're accelerating our Future Ready plan. We're driving further reductions across the core. That includes business consolidation, reduction in platforms, and supply-chain optimization. And with all of this taken together, we're confident in our ability to deliver the print margins near the top-end of our 16% to 19% target range.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And I have a couple, if I can just start with maybe AI PCs, which you referred to in terms of the momentum you're seeing with the customers and the launches that you've done. If you can share how you're seeing that flow-through when you look at the segments between consumer PS and commercial, what are you seeing in terms of activity there? Where do you expect it will make a more material impact in the coming quarters? And how do you sort of see that feeding into maybe a bit of the recovery on the consumer PS side as well? Any thoughts on that would be appreciated. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you. Let me take that question. So first of all, when we talk about consumer AI PCs, if we use the IDC description, we had said that we expected sales to be around 10% during the second half and we think we're going to be slightly above that number. So they are performing well. Where we really are also focused in what we call next-generation AI PCs that we have just started to launch. We announced our first products with Qualcomm and with AMD only a few weeks ago and shipments are starting to -- are beginning now. So we haven't seen a significant impact from those yet. The reaction has been positive. The experiences that we are able to generate are very compelling. We had an event with many of our software providers a few weeks ago in New York when we were able to display that. So the reaction is positive, but the impact on our results has been very, very small yet. In terms of adoption, we think that in the very short term, adoption in consumer will be faster because adoption in commercial is always limited by the evaluation process that many of our customers have to go through and those evaluation processes are only starting. So it's going to take some time until they have an impact in our results. And in terms of the projections that we have for the future, we maintain the projections that we have been sharing over the last quarters. We expect next-generation AI PCs to represent around 50% of shipments in 2027, three years after launch, and they drive an average selling price increase between 5% and 10%. This has been the projections we have been sharing before and we are confident that we will continue -- we will deliver on those in the future.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it, got it. Thanks for that. And if for my follow-up, I can just ask you on the print business. I understand the sort of headwinds and the competitive landscape that you're calling out, but how should we think about what's the sort of what are you seeing in terms of market-share play-out, particularly as the competitive landscape sounds like it's tougher, would you sort of look at it from a market-share perspective and say the Japanese competitors are more competitive and you're giving up some share in certain segments? Or do you think it's more just the underlying market that's a challenge here relative to market share? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Okay. Let me take this opportunity to share a bit more about what we are seeing on the print market and then how do we project this going forward. As we said in the prepared remarks, clearly the print market was challenged and we didn't see the recovery that we were expecting. But within that, we saw some signs of positive change. For example, we saw positive growth on the home space. The decline in the office category was lower than the declines we had seen in previous quarters. And as Karen said before, we have seen supplies performing as expected and especially usage is a good predictor of what is going to be happening in the future. This is why we think that the slow -- slower recovery is temporary and we expect it to see changing going forward. The majority of it was in the office space and this is really what drove it from a demand perspective. From a pricing perspective, what we have seen is a continuation of what we have shared before. Many of our competitors are taking advantage of the weak yen and this is allowing them to be more cost -- more aggressive from a price perspective. We have been working to reduce the cost structure for our products to be able to place profitable units. And this is what we did this quarter. We placed units, we hold our share. We grew share in the home space. And as we continue to drive cost, we will continue -- if we see the opportunity, we will continue to place profitable units, which continues to be our goal.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Woodring: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe Enrique, for you something that you didn't necessarily allude to in-depth in your prepared remarks on the PC side was the kind of commercial/enterprise recovery that we've been talking about for a few quarters. So, can you maybe one, just help us understand as you look at commercial -- excuse me, consumer versus SMB versus large enterprises, kind of, how you would characterize PC demand across each of those end-markets? And second to that, how does that influence your view that whether there is or is not a large commercial refresh cycle still in front of us or is that behind us? Would just love to know where you think we are in that phase? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So, let me go there. But we -- I think what the market evolution on our results confirm is that we have seen a recovery of the PC market. And this recovery is mostly driven by the commercial side of the business. Trying to provide some more specifics on -- about your question, we saw market for enterprise growing close to 5%, government between 6% and 7%, SMB 3% and education 1%. So, we saw significant growth on the commercial space, especially in enterprise. And this is really supported by the trends that we had discussed before. The installed base has been aging and the companies are seeing the need to refresh that. Windows 11 is starting to have an impact and especially since Microsoft announced the -- when they will stop supporting Windows 10, and it's not only we have seen in sales, we continue to see that in the funnel of new opportunities that we see that continues to grow and it is much stronger this year than it was last year. So we think that the refresh is still ahead of us. We have only started to see that and we continue to believe that this opportunity is coming.
Erik Woodring: Thank you. That was really helpful, Enrique. Maybe, Karen, if first, nice to meet you looking forward to working together. It's great that you guys are accelerating some of these cost-saving initiatives this year. If I just look year to date revenue through the first three quarters, revenue was down about $400 million year-over-year. OpEx is up about $300 million year-over-year. So can you just help me understand how much of these cost-savings as we look forward you want to flow through to the bottom line versus it seems you are more prone maybe to make investments for longer-term growth? Can you just help me understand how with this new view on your cost-savings, how you expect to balance that drop-through versus reinvestment? Thank you.
Karen Parkhill: Yeah, thanks for the question, Erik, and I look forward to meeting you in person too. In terms of flow-through, our savings are flowing through and reflected really in our ability to deliver the margins within or above our target ranges for both PS and print despite the fact that we've got this challenging macro backdrop. Just a reminder, our savings are reflected in both OpEx and COGS. And as -- and we are reinvesting. And so as we reinvest, we're seeing a bit of a geography shift in our P&L with some higher gross profit offset by higher operating expenses because much of our investments are going to be in the OpEx area. And we've talked about the fact that we're focused on driving these savings so that we can both offset our headwinds and continue to invest in our important growth drivers for the future and you can expect that to continue.
Erik Woodring: Thanks so much.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. Hello, Enrique, and welcome, Karen. I have two questions as well. First, just for the full year, I think one of your objectives was to grow revenues for the full year. Do you still expect that to be the case? And if I could just follow up on the last question. If I look at what your guidance is implying for this year, revenues are close to flat, and operating profit dollars are expected to be close to flat despite reaching $1.3 billion in run-rate savings. So, should we be thinking of Future Ready as really just providing air cover to make investments rather than structurally changing your profit profile, because certainly, the 2024 results don't really seem to suggest that there's any expected overall improvement in operating profit despite the cost cutting? And I have a follow-up, please.
Karen Parkhill: Yes. Thanks for your question, Toni. And as we look-ahead in Q4, we are expecting some seasonal growth ahead. Personal Systems, we expect to increase sequentially low-to mid-single digits. And we said given the lingering softness in consumer, we're expecting some less seasonal growth than we've had historically. And for print, obviously, we've got improving trends in the market, but the pace is slower than we initially expected and we've got some continued pricing pressure. So, we expect print revenue to increase low-to mid-single digit and that's driven by typical seasonal strength along with some seasonality coming out of industrial with DRUPA. And obviously, we expect supplies to increase sequentially in line with last year. I would say on the Future Ready, we are focused on driving savings to offset our headwinds and ensure that we can maintain our investments. And what you saw this quarter was us having some headwinds hit us, taking some action that's going to help us more in the quarter ahead than it did in this quarter and purposely continuing our investment because we're focused on the longer-term.
Enrique Lores: I think, Toni what is important also, if we look at year-to-date operating profit growth for the different businesses versus the plan that we had at the beginning of the year, we have seen operating profit growth in Personal Systems and this is a combination of both the savings and the progress that we have seen in the market. We have not seen operating profit growth in print and we -- this was -- this is not what we were expecting at the beginning of the year. But this is the major change that we have seen. And the major driver for that is the smaller market that we see, especially in-office, and the more aggressiveness that we see especially driven by the weakness in yen. We think both things are temporary. So we don't see this as structural changes, but definitely they are impacting our performance in 2024.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you for that. And just a follow-up, Karen, I would imagine that capital allocation is probably one of the biggest decisions that you need to think about as a new CFO. I saw the increase in authorization to $10 billion. I think last time HP increased the authorization in February 2020 was actually $15 billion. A, should we read anything into that? And Karen, as the new CFO, what -- do you have a firm opinion yet on what capital return should be on an ongoing basis and whether 100% is really the right thing for the business over the next three to five years?
Karen Parkhill: Yes. Thanks for the questions, Toni. First of all, I would say, don't read anything into the new authorization. We did have a $15 billion authorization that we are near expiration and pleased that the Board increased the authorization to $10 billion at this stage. And it shows our commitment to continuing to return roughly 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. I think that is the right commitment for our shareholders at this stage. We're not changing any of that commitment longer-term. We are still committed to that capital allocation policy of returning 100%. And of course, we said unless higher ROI opportunities arise and as long as our gross leverage remains below two times. But what you've seen is that is really returning roughly 100%, and we're committed to that this year too.
Enrique Lores: Let me emphasize that, Toni, nobody should read anything on the number. $10 billion is close to a third of our market cap. It's a very big number and this is going to take us several years to get there. So no, nothing important behind the number except our commitment to continue to do it.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Two for me as well. First, if you just look over the last three quarters and it's kind of been asked in different ways, but I just thought I'd asked it a little differently here. If you look at the last three quarters, you've shown revenue overall company-level revenue acceleration. But in the same timeframe, you've also seen EPS growth deceleration and decline this last reported quarter. But are you hitting some type of inflection where the cost-savings impact is no longer able to offset arguably where you've been operating in terms of maybe unsustainably high print margins this year? And as we carry the thought process into next year, does it really mean that given some of the efforts that Karen alluded to in terms of acceleration of cost-savings into this year, that there was incremental flow-through into next year? And can we see revenue and EPS growth be in sync or is there something more structural that's kind of causing this dislocation? And I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Yes, we don't think there is anything structural. I think it's more the result of what we see from a competitive perspective. And I will go back to some of the data I was sharing with Toni before. Year-to-date, Print PCs are growing operating profit. We are not seeing that growth in print and this is really driven by the softness that we see on the office space and the aggressive pricing that we see because of the weakness of yen. On the positive side, we have seen the home business recovering and probably more important than that is the fact that supplies and our supplies business is performing as we were expecting. So really no changes in supplies. And always supplies is a good indicator of what we would expect to see in the print side going forward because it talks about the usage that our customers are using and how really our devices and the printers are being utilized. If you look at the guide and the midpoint of the guide, we expect EPS to grow this year. So from that perspective, we expect growth. But yes, it's slightly lower than we were expecting because of the competitive environment that we are facing, especially in print,
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Wamsi Mohan: And Karen, I look forward to working with you. I guess if I could just follow up on this on the free cash flow. When you look at sort of the lower -- coming in at the lower end of the EPS range, your free cash flow range has been unchanged. You also called out some acceleration of the Future Ready program. So should we take that there is no incremental cash impact because of Future Ready program in this fiscal year? And should we think also that despite that wider range, you're more likely to come in at the lower end of that free cash flow range as well? Or are there other puts and takes that would maybe drive it higher than that? Thank you.
Karen Parkhill: Thanks, Wamsi. I would just start with, we're pleased with our free-cash flow this quarter. It did come in better-than-expected and it really reflects the strength of the sequential growth in PS that drives working capital improvements. And remember that our PS cash conversion cycle is negative. And so, we're going to continue to expect projected sequential PS revenue improvement and you can expect that to contribute to Q4 free-cash flow as well. So, our outlook remains unchanged to deliver $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for the full year, we're confident in our ability to deliver the remainder that we've got in Q4. And keep in mind that our free cash flow is stronger in the back half. And so we just expect that strength to continue.
Tim Brown: I think it's also important to put in context the change of overall guide for the year. We are talking about $0.05, which represents $60 million, $70 million. So you put that in the context of the cash-flow guide, you will see that the impact of the small change that we are driving is really small.
Enrique Lores: Yes. Just related to the future-ready, I don't know if this is part of your question,, but the cash outlays for Future Ready expect to be roughly the same as we've been saying about $300 million.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you so much.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I was just wondering if you could expand around some of the comments you made around placing more hardware at print, potentially at the expense of margins. And could you talk a little bit more about the strategy there? And then maybe you can just update us on some of the print KPIs what's the current percentage of revenue that's profit upfront? And what are some of the latest figures on the Instant Ink or other plans like all-in-a-hardware subscription today? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes, thank you. So when -- let's see, first of all, our strategy has not changed and it continued to be placed profitable units. And as we had said before, we were expecting to be able to be more aggressive in the second half as we were driving cost reductions at the hardware level and this is what we did. And this is why at the overall print level, we grew market share this quarter, and especially in the home space and also in A3 and in A4 value. So this is what drove our ability to place more units and to gain some share, even if the environment was more competitive than what we were expecting. We continue to make good progress in driving the business model changes that we have been sharing before. Instant Ink revenue continues to grow. Net subscribers continue to grow. The number of subscribers in the all-in program continues to grow. So, we continue to make very good progress on that front. And also we continue to be in the 50% range of profit on front units similar to what we have shared before. So good performance in that level and nothing relevant to share in those areas.
Michael Ng: Great. Thanks. And if I could just follow up on the Personal Systems revenue seasonality up low-to-mid sequentially. I appreciate there are some lingering headwinds in Consumer. Is something getting worse sequentially? And is some of that consumer weakness concentrated in certain regions or industry verticals? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: No, I think it's a consequence of the softness that we see. And this really is when we compare to previous quarters, we think that Q4 is going to be a stronger quarter than Q3 from a consumer PC perspective. But we think that the growth is going to be lower than what we had seen in previous years, given that we expect to see this softness in consumer, nothing else behind that this assumption.
Michael Ng: Thank you, Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Irvin Liu: Hi, thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I have one and a follow-up. So, on the personal systems side, can you just give us a sense on how durable your recent price increases are? Understandably, some of this was commodity-driven, but in the event that we see some of these commodity prices stabilize, how do you think about your ability to maintain your ASPs?
Enrique Lores: I would say we are still in the process of adjusting our prices up, as I have shared in previous calls, we cannot adjust prices immediately because there are contracts that have been signed or deals that have been done. So it takes us some time to adjust. And also this quarter, given the competitive environment that we are seeing, probably we are not able to adjust them as much as we wanted, but you should expect us that we will continue to do that in the coming quarters. If we look at the PC business, from a historical perspective, we are always able to adjust prices, but it takes some time until we fully adjust them based on all the drivers that I mentioned before.
Irvin Liu: Got it. Thank you. For my second question, I was hoping you can provide us an update on what you're seeing in the Federal Government customer vertical. I think during the first half of the year, budget discussions did weigh on your business a little bit. But with that sort of in the rearview mirror, how has your federal business trended? And how should we think about budget flush dynamics through the balance of the year?
Enrique Lores: Yes. I mentioned that slightly before, when I talked about government, the Federal Government is part of that and it was actually the segment where we saw the strongest growth this quarter, it grew between 6% and 7% and we think that -- we think that this is going to continue in the second-half. It will be a source of growth in the commercial -- in the commercial space. And for example, we signed a deal -- we have been signing deals with many of the large businesses. We signed one with NASA that we are especially proud of because it was a big replacement and a great mix of both workstations and notebooks. So very good deals and very good funnel in this space.
Irvin Liu: Thanks for the color.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: And our last question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Steven Chin: Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. Enrique, the first question for you regarding personal systems and the commercial refresh cycle. With the Windows 10 end-of-life schedule to occur in about a year from now or four quarters, I was wondering just based on historic patterns whenever certain Windows is in its end of life, any thoughts on how the refresh cycle might look from a quarterly basis? Do you expect fairly steady purchases from now until to next year? Or is there sort of like a stronger ramp-up towards that deadline? And also related, do you think, I guess the ramp volumes of Intel's new Lunar Lake if customers might be waiting for that in conjunction with the replacements?
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me let me go through both. So first of all, the majority of the refresh is still ahead of us. If we compare to previous cycles, it has probably started in a slightly slower way, but we are clearly picking-up momentum. And when we look at the funnel of opportunities that we have and the growth of the funnel compared to where we were a few quarters ago is definitely growing and definitely supporting the opportunity that we see. And in terms of customers waiting for the Intel refresh, this is not something that we are seeing the opposite. We are starting to see good momentum in commercial as the results this quarter reflect and the projections that we have shared for Q4 and for the coming quarters.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call-back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks.
Enrique Lores: So, let me just start by -- close by saying thank you to all for having joined today. A big welcome to Karen to the business and to the team. A big thank you to team for the great work that they have done over the last quarters. And going back to the business, I think Q3 confirms the momentum that we have. We are pleased to see the company growing again after nine quarters. So I think that's a great change. And we also know that the competitive environment continues to be difficult, especially in print, especially in office and that -- and we are accelerating our cost actions to compensate for that, but we remain very confident in the long-term opportunity that the company has, especially integrating AI into our portfolio and redefining the future of work. This is where the company is focused and this is where we are really investing to continue to have profitable growth in the future. But thank everybody and looking forward to seeing all of you in the coming weeks. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-05-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2024 HP Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Eric and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. When we started the fiscal year, we committed to very specific goals, drive profitable growth in our core, accelerating key growth areas and deliver operational efficiency. I am pleased to say we accomplished this and delivered a solid quarter and first half. The focus of our teams and actions we have taken continue to drive results and build momentum. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis. We made good progress against our future ready plan and we continue to invest in innovative technologies with a strong emphasis on AI and hybrid. Today, I will cover our second quarter results, including the recovery we are starting to see in commercial PCs, progress against our strategic priorities, key innovations we are bringing to market and our expectations for the remainder of fiscal year 2024. Then I will turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. I will start with our results. We continue to navigate well a dynamic and competitive environment. While our net revenue was down 1%, the rate of decline slowed for the fourth straight quarter. Personal Systems also returned to growth for the first time in eight quarters. This is a good indicator of overall market stabilization and solid execution. Non-GAAP operating profit grew 2% and non-GAAP EPS was up 4% year-over-year, which was slightly above the midpoint of our last quarter's guidance. In terms of new innovations, Q2 was one of our most significant quarters. At our Amplify Partner Conference in March, we showcased over 100 AI-enabled solutions redefining productivity and collaboration. This event is our largest annual channel conference attracting over 1,500 of our top partners from 95 countries. It inspired our partners and will help us to drive long-term sustained growth. Let me share some of the key innovations we announced. For the more than 0.5 million data scientists, who are using our workstation solutions to create AI models that improve company workflows, we had a lot to share. We announced the HP AI Creation Center, the world's most comprehensive workstation solutions for AI development. And we unveiled a strategic collaboration with NVIDIA to integrate their pre-trained models and software into our AI studio set of tools. They will allow customers to access, share and edit their data science workflows more easily from anywhere. At the same time, we launched the industry's largest portfolio of AI PCs, the first to deliver the benefits of running AI locally on the device for improved performance, efficiency and privacy. In Print, we shared how AI will unlock opportunities to make printing smarter, more efficient and more personalized. And we unveiled our new color laser jet series optimized for small and medium businesses. We also stepped up in our key growth areas. In hybrid systems, we expanded our portfolio of room solutions with Poly Studio 360 degree camera, enabling more immersive meeting experiences. In workforce solutions, we introduced an enhanced workforce experience platform, providing CIOs with an AI enabled digital experience to unlock the full potential of their teams. In addition, we are enabling our partners and sales teams to capitalize on the AI opportunity. We have introduced the industry's first ever role based AI MasterClass training and certification program. Doubling down on our momentum, last week at the Microsoft Copilot+ PC event, we introduced the world's most powerful ultra-mobile next-gen AI PCs. Designed from the ground up, they enable on-the-go leaders and freelancers to harness the most powerful AI technologies available. We also showcased our new AI Helix logo that helps you easily identify and select this new category of devices. Initial reaction has been overwhelmingly positive with our next-gen devices being recognized as some of the most premium announced and having beyond cutting-edge hardware. We are already helping customers unlock tangible value from their AI PCs. For example, collaborating with Deloitte Consulting, together we have created an on-device assistant to drive efficiency around common IT support challenges. The solution has the potential to return close to 100,000 hours of productivity to their practitioners. This is a powerful example of the positive impact of AI PCs. One of HP's most important assets is the strength of our brand and we continue to invest in it to build even greater value. This quarter, we announced our historic title partnership with Scuderia Ferrari. This is an opportunity to elevate our brand and reach new audiences and geographies, particularly younger and premium customers. It also improves the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing spend. And we are excited to work with Scuderia Ferrari, leveraging the latest HP innovations to help them drive their competitive advantage. HP is a trusted brand. We are a company that stands for more than just the products we make. For the fifth year in a row, HP has earned a AAA rating from CDP. Next month, we will release our Annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining the progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. Let me now share in more detail what we saw in each of our businesses in Q2. In Personal Systems, we executed our strategy driving both revenue growth and increasing profitability year-over-year. The PS revenue was $8.4 billion, that's up 3% year-over-year, driven mainly by market growth and signs of commercial recovery. Our PS operating profit was 6%, in line with our expectations and solidly within our long-term target range. Our teams continue to show their focus by driving profitable PC share in calendar Q1 in high-value categories like commercial premium and mobile workstations. Importantly, we continue to invest and grow in high value and key growth areas. In gaming, we grew revenue year-over-year again this quarter. PS services was up with strong growth in managed services. And in hybrid systems, we saw signs of recovery. Here we drove sequential growth and strong performance in video collaboration. We remain confident that this evolving market will be a long-term growth opportunity. In the second half, we expect to see the introduction of AI PCs accelerate demand over and above the anticipated PC refresh cycle and Windows 11 rollout. We believe the AI opportunity in front of us will help drive higher ASPs and premium mix. We have a comprehensive portfolio of AI-enabled devices from consumer, commercial, gaming, accessories, room solutions to advanced workstation solutions. We're innovating beyond hardware with software and security solutions like HP AI companion and HP Wolf Security that uses deep learning, behavior analysis and AI based protection against malware and deep fakes. We have rich history and proven track-record of integrating meaningful AI technologies, such as noise removal and gesture controls. Together with our strong innovation pipeline, we are well-positioned to capture the opportunity and lead the industry. Turning to Print, results were in line with what we expected. Revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% year-over-year and flat quarter-over-quarter. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China and some parts of Europe. The pricing environment remains competitive in consumer with intensifying pressure in commercial. We continued to make progress on pricing and share gains in supplies with revenue results as expected. We delivered Print operating profit of 19%, in line with our guidance. Once again, we demonstrated disciplined cost management, improved mix and the benefits of the strong innovations we have brought to market. Our focus in Print remains on regaining profitable share and we are making progress. We grew share quarter-over-quarter in home and in office. Importantly, we gained share year-over-year and sequentially in big tanks and business ink. We also grew in key growth areas like consumer services. We saw growth in revenue and in subscriber numbers across instant ink and our new all-in plans. In industrial graphics, we continue to accelerate the adoption of digital technologies. In Q2, we grew year-over-year and for the third straight quarter. We also expanded our portfolio, adding new end-to-end automation processes leveraging AI and robotics. These are on full display right now at Drupa 2024, the largest trade fair for the printing and graphics industry worldwide. 3D continued to be impacted by elongated purchasing cycles in Q2, reflecting constraints on capital spending. The decline in hardware was partially offset by growth in services and supplies. Overall, in Q2, we made good progress against our future ready strategy. We continue to execute according to plan and we are on track to deliver on our three-year annual growth run-rate, structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by the end of fiscal year 2025. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q3 and the second half of fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment will remain dynamic and that our markets will continue to be very competitive. That said, we're encouraged by the progress we have made delivering a solid first half and we expect a stronger second half. The anticipated commercial PC refresh as well as early gains from the AI PC, together with our plans to gain share in Print, gives us confidence we are well-positioned to drive growth in our core businesses. At the same time, we see significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas. As you have seen repeatedly, we are delivering to expectations and will continue to maintain our focus as we enter the second half. We remain confident in our strategy and we'll continue to execute on our plan. Let me now turn it over to Tim.
Tim Brown: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q2, driven by disciplined financial management and focused execution while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment. We are pleased with our continued progress we made in Q2 toward delivering on our financial commitments. Total revenue decline slowed further. Our gross profit dollars and margin, our non-GAAP operating profit dollars and margin, and our non-GAAP EPS, all improved both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In addition, we generated solid free cash flow. We achieved these results while simultaneously reinvesting in our key growth areas and in AI and managing through a mixed market environment characterized by slightly stronger PS commercial performance, balanced against continuing Print market demand challenges. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.8 billion in the quarter, down 1%, both nominally and in constant currency. In constant currency, Americas increased 2%, EMEA declined 3% and APJ declined 5%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 23.6% in the quarter, up one point year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 14.8% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by continued investments in higher variable compensation partially offset by cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 2%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $158 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.03 or 4% to $0.82 with a diluted share count of approximately one billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $205 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles, restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture related charges, non-operating retirement related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.61. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.4 billion, up 3% or 2% in constant currency, driven by higher volumes led by commercial, partially offset by a decline in ASPs and continued weakness in China. Total units were up 7% with consumer down 1% and commercial up 12%. Personal Systems revenue returned to growth exceeding our expectations. We are encouraged by the positive momentum exiting Q2 as we head into the seasonally stronger second half of the year. Drilling into the details, consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial revenue was up 6%, representing greater than 70% of Personal Systems revenue. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter driven by a favorable mix shift toward commercial and increased consumer pricing, offset largely by an increased mix of lower end devices. While our market share declined in calendar Q1, as competition intensified, we drove share improvements in high value categories, including mobile workstations and commercial premium. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Last week, we announced the launch of our next-gen AI PC, which is part of a series of launches planned for this year that will expand our portfolio of AI PCs as we enable our customers to deploy advanced AI technology at the edge. Personal Systems delivered $508 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.0%. Our margin increased 0.7 points year-over-year, driven by lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, including Future Ready savings, offset partially by competitive pricing and investments. In Print, our results reflected our focus on improving execution and diligently managing cost as we continue to navigate a very competitive Print market. In Q2, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 8% on a reported basis and down 7% in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in both hardware and supplies. Hardware revenue was down 18% year-over-year, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand, especially in China and EMEA as well as share loss in both home and office due to aggressive pricing, partially driven by further depreciation of the yen. Total hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue for the third consecutive quarter, driven by supplies and service, offsetting softer hardware demand as we believe our customers delayed purchasing decisions in anticipation of Drupa, which started yesterday. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 17%. Consumer revenue decreased 16% with units down 17%. In big tank, we increased our volumes and market share sequentially, partially offsetting continued market softness and competitive pricing in the traditional home ink market. In consumer services, we drove revenue and subscriber growth in both our instant ink and all-in plans. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, down 5% on a reported basis and down 4% in constant currency. This was in line with our outlook. Print operating profit was $829 million, down 8% year-over-year and operating margin was 19%. Operating margin was flat year-over-year, driven by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready savings and favorable mix offset by competitive hardware pricing. Turning to our Future Ready transformation plan. We are on track to achieve our fiscal year end '24 goal of delivering a cumulative 70% of our year end '25 goal of gross annual run-rate structural cost savings of $1.6 billion. We expect to achieve this by driving efficiencies in our core businesses. We are pleased with our progress in reducing our costs across Print and PS. We continue to see the benefits of initiatives we launched in prior quarters. For example, we continue to optimize our location strategy with plans for additional site actions this year. In our digital transformation initiatives, we are accelerating our generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools such as GitHub Copilot to approximately 60% of our developers as well as implementing HP specific large language models to improve efficiencies across our sales and service organizations. In marketing, we continue to optimize and in house our digital media capabilities and maximize programmatic investments. Specifically, we are delivering savings through AI-enhanced capabilities, scaling content production and working towards translation cost efficiencies, helping us improve our NPI marketing efficiency with lower agency costs and next-gen market insights and measurement. In PS, we are simplifying our portfolio as we announced last week, our brand simplification strategy across our consumer and commercial portfolios. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $581 million and free cash flow was $481 million, driven by net earnings. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This decreased two days sequentially due to days inventory increasing nine days, days payable increasing 16 days and days receivable increasing five days. The increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and sea shipments, both of which drive economic value. The strategic buys continue to allow us to take advantage of attractive economic offerings from suppliers to reduce the near-term financial impact of rising commodity costs. The increase in DPO was driven by an increase in accounts payable due to purchase timing and higher strategic buy inventory. In Q2, we returned approximately $369 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $269 million in cash dividends. We finished the quarter within our target leverage range and expect to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders in FY'24 and over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains below two times and the less higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to the second half of FY'24 keep the following in mind related to our FY'24 and Q3 financial outlook. As Enrique said, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first half. We continue to model multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY'24, we are narrowing our non-GAAP EPS outlook range to $0.30, but we continue to see a range of potential outcomes for H2 '24, which is reflected in our updated outlook. We remain focused on improving our cost structure and our performance while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.6 billion in FY'24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion for FY'24, improving sequentially in both fiscal Q3 and Q4. As a reminder, our free cash flow outlook includes approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems, specifically for Q3, we expect Personal Systems revenue will increase sequentially by a high-single-digit, though slightly less than typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be towards the high end of our long-term target range of 5% to 7% in Q3, augmented by disciplined cost management actions. For FY'24, we expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC revenue in the back half of the year, continued mix improvements and cost efficiencies. In Print, we expect Print to stabilize in the second half of the year, consistent with the market outlook. For Q3, we expect Print revenue to decrease sequentially by low-single-digit, in line with typical seasonality. We continue to expect supplies revenue in FY'24 to decline by a low to mid-single-digit in constant currency. For Q3, we expect Print margins to be in the upper half of our 16% and 19% range and now expect FY'24 margins to be at the high-end of the range, driven by rigorous cost management. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2024. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.92 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.77. We expect FY'24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.60 and FY'24 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.90. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thank you guys very much for taking my questions. Enrique, maybe if I turn to you first. At the start of the year, you had talked about the Print business kind of performing in line with the market at roughly flat this year. Year-to-date, it's declining, let's call it mid-single-digits. You're telling us supplies will continue to decline low to mid-single-digits, but you expect the market to stabilize in the second half of the year. And so maybe my first question is, why do you believe other than easier year-over-year compares, the Print market will stabilize in the second half of the year? Are there any of the underlying factors that have impacted the Print business? Are any of those changing as you look to the second half like yen competition and broader market trends? And then as we think about hardware seasonality in the second half of the year, should we still be thinking about an improving trend sequentially there? How does that translate to year-over-year growth? If you could unpack all of that just for Print, that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Erik. It's a long question, so I'll try to cover all your points. So, first of all, in terms of what do we see from a competitive perspective, as you mentioned, we continue to see fairly strong competition in the consumer side, similar to what we were seeing in Q1 where we have seen an intensified competition is in the office space, driven by the main -- similar reasons and what we have -- what has happened in consumer. But this clearly has evolved. When we think about the second half, we expect the market to stabilize. And you mentioned one of the key reasons, which is an easier compare to what we had in the second half of 2023. Our underlying drivers that give us some confidence in this number, first of all is what we are seeing from a usage perspective that usage has been fairly stable, especially in the office space per printer, which is always a good indicator of what is going to be the overall performance from a printer perspective. And then in terms of our own projections for HP, as we shared last quarter, we have been working to reduce our cost structure to be able to be more competitive. So we expect to have some share gains in the second half, again because of the cost actions that we have been driving during the previous two quarters. So in our performance, you should see that reflected. And again this doesn't mean that we have changed our strategy. Our strategy continues to be profitable growth. It's just that we will be able to sell more units in a profitable way and capture share in this way.
Erik Woodring: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe if I just -- if I stay on the printing side, again really strong Print operating margin performance. It was down about 90 basis points sequentially. And I think Print -- as a Print supplies as a percentage of Print mix was up sequentially just given the weak Print hardware trends. So, I deduce that would mean supplies margins were lower sequentially. Can you maybe just unpackage, one, if that's the correct way of thinking about it? And then two, what drove that trend and how is it impacting your view on Print operating margins for the second half of the year? Thanks so much.
Tim Brown: Yeah, Erik, this is Tim. I'll maybe take that. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, you're right, it was down about 0.9. It wasn't so much driven by supplies gross margin rate. We made some additional investments, most notably in variable compensation and that was a bigger driver.
Enrique Lores: Margins for the second half?
Tim Brown: Oh, I'm sorry, margins for the second half. Yes, from a Print perspective, as I said in the prepared remarks, we expect to be in the upper half of the long-term 16% to 19% range in Q3 and for the full year at the upper-end of that range. I think a couple of the key drivers that you should think about is, one, the 2H sequential improvement we do expect to see in hardware, both from a market and a share perspective. We'll continue to focus on driving operating profit dollars as well through new business models and cost management. And then just to reiterate, as we said before, our forecast for supplies is to decline low to mid-single-digits in constant currency for the full year. And again, from a range perspective, just keep in mind, we provide these for modeling purposes, but we really are trying to drive OP dollars.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thank you so much guys.
Enrique Lores: Thanks, Erik.
Operator: Your next question comes from Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the question. Within Personal Systems, we saw inflections in both consumer and commercial units. You talked a little bit about a recovery that you're seeing in commercial PCs. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on that? Are there any specific verticals where you're seeing that spend improve? Do you think this is an indication of a broader IT spending recovery? And then are there any comments you can make on the slowdown in consumer unit growth? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So let me start and maybe Tim wants to make a few comments afterwards. So I think you highlighted the key points. We saw for the first time in eight quarters growth in the PC business. And really commercial is the highlight of the quarter that performed even better than we were expecting. It was fairly consistent between North America and Europe and between enterprise and SMB. So probably the key thing is that was not one segment, was across this segment while we continue to see weakness in Asia, especially in China. Probably some of the underlying factors that we have seen, the drivers of this is the need to refresh the installed base as it has been aging and especially as we look at the second half, when we look at the funnel of opportunities that we see that is significantly bigger than what we had last year. And also the fact that we are starting to see some deals driven by Windows 11 Refresh. This is what we are reflecting in the projections that we have for the second half where we expect this momentum to continue. Also on the -- for the second half, we expect the federal business and this is how US focused comment will also improve because during the first half, the business was impacted by the budget discussions and as some of them have been released, we expect the federal business to also be stronger in the second half.
Michael Ng: Excellent. Thank you for all that color, Enrique. And then just as a quick follow-up, it was helpful to hear about the inventory increase due to strategic buys. I was just wondering if you could refresh us on your philosophy and strategy around those component purchases. Said differently, how far in advance are you buying some of these components? When would we see more market rate component flow through the P&L? Thank you.
Tim Brown: Yeah, sure. This is Tim. I'll take that one. We haven't changed our philosophy or our strategy with respect to strategic buys. We'll continue to kind of evaluate them based on the opportunities that present themselves. And if it makes financial sense for us, we'll take those. I mean, certainly that is something that we try and do and offset from an operational standpoint by making our operational inventory more efficient and utilize that more efficient. So I think that just underscores our commitment to efficient inventory management. And I think as we look forward, we'll continue to do that.
Enrique Lores: And there is not a predetermined view in terms of how many months or really looking at the impact they will have in the P&L and our ability to consume those products in a reasonable amount of time.
Michael Ng: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Tim.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. This is Chen on for Amit. I just had a question on the commentary about AI PCs that you talked about on the call. We're obviously hearing a lot about AI PCs across the supply chain heading into the second half of the year. How are you thinking about the adoption curve of these AI PCs? And really because there hasn't been a killer app introduced yet, how should we think about the mix of AI PCs versus non-AI PCs and your units shipped in the back half of the year? And how should we think about the AI -- the ASP tailwinds from these AI PCs in fiscal '24 and '25?
Enrique Lores: Sure. We've seen that the penetration of AI PCs is going to be growing over time. This year, we have products coming both from the first-generation that we announced in January and February and for the next-generation that we just announced a couple of weeks ago. If we look at the total of both, we expect that the -- they will represent around 10% of the shipments for the second half. That's how we are quantifying that. But really, the impact will be more relevant in '25 and in '26. In fact, we expect that AI PCs and at that point will be our new-generation will be between 40% and 60% of our sales three years after launch. That's kind of how we're looking at that. And as we have discussed before, we continue to believe that they will drive an improvement in average selling price of between 5% and 10%.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Enrique, I was wondering if you could expand a little more on the comment on signs of commercial recovery in PS. I think you said partially driven by adoption of Win 11. How much would you characterize? Have you seen any real traction yet on Win 10 end-of-life support driven strength or perhaps if you could characterize it even from a COVID refresh perspective or anything else, any color there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. As you know, Wamsi, this was one of the assumptions that we had at the beginning of the year that Windows 11 Refresh would be impacting the results on the second half. And we are starting to see that, not so much on the numbers for Q2, but yes, in the funnel that we are starting to see and the opportunities that many of our large enterprise customers are starting to bring us. It's clearly starting to happen. During Q2, Microsoft published dates and cost to support the previous operating systems and this always creates an acceleration of the process and this is what we have started to see. In parallel to that, as you mentioned, clearly, the installed base has been aging during the last two, three years and we think this is also impacting the strength that we are starting to see on the commercial side.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Enrique. As a follow-up, I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on the seasonality? I think you said you're expecting in PS revenue up high-single-digit, slightly below typical seasonality and then continuing to grow into Q4. Just wondering maybe if you could put that in perspective of maybe second half versus first half, how that might compare to a typical year seasonality half versus half? And just on the margin side, clearly very impressive margins here and you're on track on your Future Ready program. Would you say that like is there any sense you can give us on how those savings are flowing across PS and Print just so we would understand sort of cost savings and things that you're doing on your Future Ready side versus pricing and mix? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Tim, do you want to take the seasonality one?
Tim Brown: Yeah. So, hey, as you said, Wamsi, from a Q3 to Q2, excuse me, Q3 perspective, we do expect to grow sequentially high-single-digits, but slightly below normal seasonality. I think your question is really about the full half. I think you could think about the seasonality be slightly stronger than historical for the full half if you think about Q4 in PCs.
Enrique Lores: And basically between Q3 and Q4, traditionally Q4 is a stronger quarter, so as this is how we have built a guide for the second half and the guide for each quarter. And then in terms of savings, Tim?
Tim Brown: From a Future Ready savings perspective, we do see the Future Ready across both businesses. I don't know that it's more pronounced in one versus the other. We're definitely focused from a core perspective where we're driving some of those efficiencies. I think the important thing to note about the Future Ready savings is it does help us deliver our margin rates even in a challenging demand environment. It is allowing us to reinvest in some key growth areas in key areas such as AI and our people. I'll leave it at that.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you so much.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, yeah. Thanks a lot. Hey guys. Good afternoon. Appreciate you guys taking the question. I guess let's, well, yeah, just sticking with PCs, what's a good way to think, Enrique and Tim about, I guess, kind of margin as you go through the Refresh cycle given that it sounds like you think Gen AI PCs are going to -- and AI PCs are going to be a sort of disproportionate amount of the mix? And then just a quick follow-up also. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Well, from a margin perspective, Ananda, we are not changing the guidelines that we have provided in the past. We expect the PC business to stay in the 5% to 7% range. And Tim mentioned where we expect this to be for the second half. On the -- and this is I think what at this point is the projection that we have. We have multiple variables, ups and downs, but this is our view at this point.
Ananda Baruah: Cool. And just a quick follow-up is have you guys, I'm just interested in if you have any thoughts yet, Enrique, on battery -- battery power, battery capacity, battery life over the next, let's say, 36 months. As GenAI PCs start to make their way into the world, the battery drain that comes with the use of GenAI capability, any thoughts there on battery? And that's it for me. Thanks guys.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me make two comments. First of all, we -- in the next-generation AI PCs that we introduced a couple of weeks ago, actually battery life is one of the key differentiators. In fact, battery life is over 30 hours and this is driven by the fact that both we are using ARM technology in the PCs, which is more efficient from a cost perspective, but also because one of the enablers of AI PCs is that we are building in our PCs large language models that optimize the utilization of the PC based on how each user is going to be using that. What this means is the PC will learn what applications we are using, what applications we are not using and how to optimize consumption based on that. There is really a personnel device based on your own utilization, which over time is also going to have a significant impact on battery savings, not only on ARM products, but also on x86 products is one of the big differentiators of AI PCs.
Ananda Baruah: That's a lot of great context. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Sure.
Operator: The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for the questions. I guess, if I can just start, Enrique, you had in your prepared remarks just in terms of the outlook or what you're seeing in the China markets looks overall from the momentum perspective that overall demand is not strong in that market. We've seen some of the more, I guess, macro data come out a bit more positive in recent weeks. Anything more you can share in terms of how you're thinking about the geography sort of that particular region progressing through the rest of the year? Are things getting a bit better or do you see further downside from where things are in terms of demand? Any more recent sort of commentary that you can see in terms of your order trends there? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. So we didn't see an improvement of demand in the second quarter, not for Print, nor for Personal Systems. And then we haven't built any improvement in our projections for the second half. We think that the economic situation will continue to be challenged and this is what we are building in our plan and this applies to China. In other geographies, we are seeing great momentum, great progress, for example, in India, and this has been a very positive market for us in the last quarter.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Great. And on the poly business specifically, I mean, it seems like overall demand trends are starting to improve, but when you think about sort of overall enterprises and their willingness to go back and spend on video collaboration again, what you're seeing in relation to sort of reengaging in terms of making that a priority in relation to their office space and investments in their office space? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yeah, thank you. On the overall hybrid systems business, which is how we call it, we continue to see from one side the demand has been limited. And as you said, enterprises have been limiting their investment. At the same time, quarter-on-quarter, we started to see some momentum and we expect it to continue in the second half. And this was especially true in video conferencing systems. From a long-term perspective, we continue to believe that this is a -- that this is going to be a growth opportunity for us. We think that the flexibility that the hybrid world means brings is important for companies and is important for employees. And therefore, this opportunity is going to continue to be very real in the years to come.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I just had a couple of quick clarifications and then a question. Just to clarify, you sound very constructive on the recovery in PCs and some further tailwind from AI PC. So I'm a little surprised you're actually guiding below normal seasonal for Q3. Can you explain why that is? And also just on the buybacks, the buybacks are only $100 million this quarter, quite a bit lower than first quarter. Again, could you just clarify? And I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me take the question on PCs. We are -- we saw strength on the commercial side in Q2 and we are projecting that in the second half. At the same time, we're more cautious on the demand side on consumer and we are also projecting that to continue in the second half. And this is what has some impact from a seasonality perspective, because as you know, from a seasonality perspective, consumer has a stronger seasonality in the second half and this is why we're being a bit more conservative in our assumptions for the second half. In terms of share buybacks, probably the most important comment to make is we have not changed our approach. Our goal continues to be to return 100% of free cash flow to investors unless we identify better ROI opportunities. And while our leverage stays below two, an investor should expect that we will continue to return 100% of free cash flow over time.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. And just if I could zoom out and just try and level set, like I think revenue this year and last year for HP overall is going to be $53 billion to $54 billion. Pre-COVID, the two years, it was about $58 billion. The PC market is going to be about the same level of units this year. I suppose the printing market is down a little bit. But why do you think -- why do you think revenues are still almost 10% below pre-COVID levels? And do you think like there actually should be some snap-back to pre-COVID levels or do you think there's been some share loss over the last few years? How do I reconcile those data points? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yeah, I think we will have a more detailed conversation about '25 in the coming quarters and what are the projections there. I think you touched on some of the key points. The Print market, both on Print and Office is smaller than it used to be, so this has an impact on size. Also on PCs, even during the last quarter, we have been recovering share. We are still not at the level where we were before the pandemic and our goal is to continue to grow share. So there are multiple factors. And in Q4, when we'll talk about '25, we will give kind of the projections and what we expect to see versus '19 and previous years.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. I'm looking forward to see you tomorrow, Toni.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Michael Cadiz: Hey, good afternoon. This is Michael Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. Just one question. I know you've given some good points on commercial versus consumer into second half. But through the lens of AI PCs as they gain traction starting in the back half, can you review those comments on commercial versus consumer and how we should look at them through that AI PC view?
Enrique Lores: Yes. I think the key thing though is from especially on the next-generation AI PCs, we expect a fairly small impact in the results of the second half. With the products, the products were just launched. We've -- and we will continue to expand the portfolio, but the impact in the second half is going to be fairly small. Of the products we just launched, we expect a stronger traction in consumer because commercial requires some evaluation done by customers that take some time. But over time, we expect the penetration in commercial to grow and to be more relevant in '25 and in '26.
Michael Cadiz: Excellent. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Steven Chin: Yes, hi. This is Steven calling on behalf of Krish. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, if I could, I guess, Enrique, could you talk about what percentage of your revenues today are coming from subscription based revenues whether it's Print related or also the newer all-in programs. And kind of do you have like a longer-term view on what that mix could be for next year? And are you also willing to quantify what the operating margins might be for the subscription based revenues versus what you normally sell through the retail and distribution channels?
Enrique Lores: Sure. We don't disclose the specific numbers of our subscription business, but let me make a few qualitative comments. First of all, in Q2, we continue to see growth both of net subscribers and also of revenue in the consumer services space that integrates all the subscription models. During the last quarter, we have been expanding our portfolio to first paper and then in Q2 to also include the printer in what we call the all-in model and we keep making good progress in the three subscription programs that we have at this point. Our goal is, of course, to continue to grow this business because both enables us to offer a better value proposition to our customers, but also because allows us to capture more value per customer as the value proposition seems stronger and you can approximate that to profit that we get from customers, so we really think this as a way of building a more accretive business.
Steven Chin: Great. Thank you for that. And as my follow-up question, maybe for Tim. I had a question on the balance sheet and specifically inventories as well. I was wondering if there's a major structural change that is going on in terms of inventory dollar levels. If I look at your current revenue run rate and also the current inventory levels, I would have, and comparing to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal '17 where revenue levels were similar to today, your inventory levels are much higher in terms of dollars. I'm just kind of wondering, is this all just due to buy aheads or strategic buys or is there also some element of the change in your current business mix whether it's higher commercial PC mix and also the shift to more subscription model-based revenues, is that having a bigger impact on how much inventory you have to maintain? Thank you.
Tim Brown: Yeah. First on the subscription comment, no, that doesn't impact the inventory levels that we're taking. From a structural standpoint, we haven't changed our structural inventory meaningfully. Most of what you see is related to strategic buys and sea shipments as we choose to put those on the ocean. And that has -- that will change over time at times. So there's nothing more than those two things. And what I would say is, the only thing I would add is what I said before is, partially offsetting some of those decisions we make, we are continuing to actually improve our operational inventory to help fund those other items.
Steven Chin: Thank you so much.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Tim. Let me thank you everybody for joining the call. As you saw, Q2 was a solid quarter that closes a solid first half of the year. And the more relevant thing is the recovery that we saw in PCs, especially in commercial PCs, which makes us being positive about the second half, where we expect a stronger second half than what we have seen in the first half. And the combination of the progress on the execution side and the growth that we continue to experience in the, what we call the growth businesses, gives us confidence in our ability to continue to create value long-term. So thank you again everybody for joining. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-02-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 HP Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Krista and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I will now turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to HP's first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer and Tim Brown, HP's Interim Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year.

For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you all for joining today's call. Let me begin by saying it was a solid start to the year. We delivered non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS growth year-over-year and our future ready plan is positioning us well to deliver on our long-term growth targets. I'm going to focus my remarks today on our first quarter performance, our progress against key strategic priorities, and our expectations for the market for the balance of 2024. I will then turn the call over to Tim for a deeper dive into our financials and outlook. Starting with our results, we are managing through a volatile external environment that continues to impact demand across our industry. This is reflected in our top line with net revenue down 4% year-over-year. It's worth noting that the rate of revenue decline slowed for the third straight quarter, which we see as an encouraging sign of market stabilization. We continue to make progress in our key growth areas. We're maintaining our investments in a down market to strengthen our competitive position and there are several bright spots this quarter. We grew revenue and market share year-over-year in gaming. Orco Solutions delivered solid revenue growth and won several new accounts, including large global companies in the energy, retail, and telecommunication sectors, and we drove continued momentum in consumer subscriptions with Instant Ink delivering another quarter of revenue and net subscriber growth year-over-year. Alongside the progress we are making in our growth areas, we are also driving disciplined execution across the business. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 5% year-over-year, and we delivered 11% non-GAAP EPS growth, which was right at the midpoint of our last quarter's guide. This reflects our focus on managing our mix, reducing our costs and maximizing operational efficiencies and we remain well on track to deliver on our three-year gross annual run rate structural cost savings target of $1.6 billion by fiscal year '25. Q1 was also a quarter of strong innovation across our portfolio. I'm particularly pleased with the progress we are making on the company-wide AI strategy we shared with you previously. As you will recall, we are focused on creating new product categories, expanding our digital services and solutions and driving internal productivity. We took a big stake forward this quarter at CES, where we launched our first laptops using Intel's new core ultra processors. This launch help us to win over 100 innovation awards at CES. More importantly, this is just the start of what will be an exciting year for AI PC innovation as we bring new products to market with our silicon and software partners in the coming quarters. Alongside the PC opportunity, we continue to develop new AI applications to run on top of our installed base of more than 200 million commercial devices. The best example of this is the workforce central platform we have discussed with you previously. We have since expanded and renamed the offering which we now refer to as the HP Workforce Experience platform. It integrates data and telemetry from our PC printer and poly devices into a single dashboard to improve productivity, security and collaboration, and it is now available to all of our managed solution customers. We're also shifting more of our offerings to subscriptions in consumer segment. This week, we will be launching our HP all-in subscription plan, which we previewed with you at our Investor Day last October. For a monthly fee, consumers will receive a printer in delivery premium 24/7 support and an option to upgrade their hardware every two years. This has tested extremely well in our pilots with customer satisfaction exceeding Instant Ink's already high scores. All of this gives us great momentum heading into our Amplify Partner Conference next week. Amplify is our largest channel event of the year, drawing our top 1,500 commercial resellers from around the world. We will have several of our top silicon and software partners with us to discuss the AIPC opportunity. And we will be launching a range of new innovations across personal systems, print and workforce solutions. In addition to our innovation, I'm really excited about the work we are doing to elevate the HP brand. To lead this work, I am pleased that Antonio Lucio, who joined HP last month as our Chief Marketing and Corporate Affairs Officer. Antonio was our first CMO following the creation of HP Inc. in 2015. Under his leadership, we strengthened our reputation as one of the world's most trusted brands. And you will see us launching new brand campaigns that are globally scalable and locally relevant. For example, earlier this month, we announced a multiyear deal with Real Madrid football club with millions of funds and more than 0.5 billion followers on social media, Real Madrid is one of the most loved brands. And as the club's newest technology partner, who will be collaborating to create new fun experiences. We also recently announced a global collaboration with Riot Games, one of the world's top game developers, and we will be working with them to develop future gaming products, technical innovation and co-branded marketing campaigns. Underpinning all of this, we are continuing to advance our sustainable impact strategy, which continues to drive innovation and help us to win new deals. I was proud to see HP ranked number 13 on this year's list, of America's most just companies from Just Capital and CNBC. This was our fifth straight year on the list and our highest ever ranking, up 34 spots year-over-year and putting us in the top 2% of companies measured. Let me now provide some additional color on our business unit performance. The external environment remains dynamic. In Consumer, we anticipate that a post-holiday slowdown, and this was a bit more pronounced than initially expected. Commercial customers remain cautious. While we saw signs of stabilization in the SMB and education markets, we saw a slowdown in U.S. enterprise and federal sales especially in the month of January. We also continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions, partially offset by strength in India. Personal Systems net revenue was $8.8 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency, reflecting market dynamics and seasonality. Consistent with the industry estimate, we continue to expect the PC market to grow low-single-digits in 2024 and we expect to grow at least in line with the market. Our PS team continued to show resilience and operational rigor, delivering operating profit of 6.1%, which was solidly within our long-term target range, so slightly below our expectations. Importantly, we once again gained PC share in calendar Q4, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. This shows that HP innovation is winning in the market, and we are winning in the right areas with a focus on high-value segments such as premium work stations and gaming. Peers services revenue was up year-over-year with strong growth in digital services. And while hybrid systems remains impacted by the current enterprise spending environment, we are investing in the portfolio for deferential market recovery and long-term growth opportunity. Turning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion. That's down 5% year-over-year, reflecting market headwinds. China softness and the aggressive pricing environment. And I am pleased with the progress we are making on pricing and share gains in supply. We continue to effectively manage our costs and mix between consumer and commercial, with operating profit of 19.9%. We're also making progress on our efforts to regain profitable share. We gained share in big tanks, both year-over-year and sequentially and we drove sequential share gains in office in parts of Europe, India and China. We're also pleased with our progress in industrial graphics and 3D both of which grew revenue year-over-year in Q1. We also saw continued recovery in labels and packaging, and we are ramping up for Drupa in May. Held every four years, this is the world's largest printing event, where we will launch a range of new innovations to accelerate our momentum in the market. Consistent with the capital allocation strategy we have shared with you previously, we resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we plan to remain active in the market for the remainder of the year. Let me now close by providing some insight into how we see the market for the balance of the year. Despite pockets of softness in Q1, we saw signs of improvement overall. While we expect the pace of recovery to be uneven across different segments, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full year non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow targets. And as we said before, we expect performance in the second half of fiscal year '24 to be seasonally stronger than the first half. By remaining focused on things we can control and investing in our future, we have proven our ability to navigate current market dynamics while capitalizing on long-term growth opportunities. This is exactly what we did in Q1. And it what you can expect from us moving forward as we drive progress against our future trade plan. I now want to introduce Tim Brown. As you know, he took over as our interim CFO in January. For those of you that don't know, TIM is one of HP's most successful and respected financial executives. He has over 30 years of HP experience, including as CFO of Print and Personal Systems and he is a steady hand on the wheel while we complete our CFO search process. Tim, thank you for your leadership, over to you.
Tim Brown: Thank you, Enrique, for the kind introduction. It's great to be with you all today. We are pleased with the progress we made during Q1 toward delivering on our financial commitments this year. On a year-on-year basis, our revenue declines continued to slow sequentially, consistent with the stabilizing trends we expected heading into the year. Non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew margins expanded in both Personal Systems and Print and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits. We remain on track with our future-ready plan to achieve our gross annual run rate structural cost savings target for this year and continue to reinvest these savings in our growth areas. We also returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders as we actively repurchased shares during the quarter. Top line results were impacted by lower market TAMs in both Personal Systems and Print. We saw cautious commercial demand as macro challenges persisted and a bit more pronounced slowdown than initially expected in consumer following Q4. As Enrique said, HP remains focused on executing each quarter while also driving long-term shareholder value. Our overall results reflect disciplined financial management and investment for sustainable profitable growth all while navigating a dynamic and competitive environment in the near term. We will continue to manage our business prudently while seizing opportunities to improve our market position as we continue to execute on our plan to deliver our fiscal year commitments. Now let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency, driven by declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 7%, EMEA declined 2%, and APJ declined 7%. APJ was impacted as soft demand in China continued. Gross margin was 21.9% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year primarily due to improved commodity and logistics costs and cost savings, partially offset by competitive pricing. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 13.5% of revenue. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses were driven primarily by investments in growth initiatives and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower variable compensation and structural cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, up 5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E was $144 million, down primarily due to lower interest expense driven by a decrease in debt outstanding. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.08 or 11% to $0.81 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $186 million, primarily related to amortization of intangibles restructuring and other charges, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.62. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $8.8 billion, down 4% or 5% in constant currency, driven by soft demand and an unfavorable mix shift partially offset by market share gains in both consumer and commercial, including categories such as premium notebooks and workstations. Total units were up 5% with consumer up 10% and commercial up 2%. Year-over-year growth rates for units and revenue improved sequentially in both consumer and commercial as stabilizing trends continued, consistent with our outlook for a PC market recovery this year. Drilling into the details, commercial revenue was down 5% and consumer down 1%. ASPs were flat quarter-over-quarter, driven by a favorable mix, including improved commercial premium mix offset primarily by an unfavorable mix shift in consumer. We remain focused on driving profitable revenue and share growth in both our consumer and commercial markets. Personal Systems delivered $537 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.1%. Our margin increased 0.9 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and cost savings. This was partially offset by pricing and investments in growth areas. Sequentially, our operating margin declined primarily due to higher commodity costs and marketing expenses, offset in part by favorable mix towards our commercial business segment. In Print, we remain focused on improving our execution and driving rigorous cost management as we navigate a challenging and competitive print market. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 5%, both nominally and in constant currency. The decline was driven by declines in hardware. Hardware revenue was down 19%, driven by lower volumes attributable primarily to continued weak demand in China and Greater Asia and share loss largely due to aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. Total hardware units decreased 17% year-over-year. Industrial Graphics grew revenue again this quarter, driven by hardware, supplies and services. By customer segment, commercial revenue decreased 12% with units down 18%. Consumer revenue decreased 22% with units down 15%. The market for big tank printers continue to increase sequentially, partially offsetting continued soft demand and aggressive pricing in the traditional home ink market. In Consumer Services, Instant Ink revenue and subscribers continued to grow year-over-year. Total subscribers now exceed 13 million, including more than 700,000 subscribers to our Instant paper add-on service. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, flat on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency primarily driven by favorable pricing actions, share gains and an easy compare, partially offset by a lower installed base. Print operating profit was $872 million, essentially flat year-over-year and operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 1 point driven by lower hardware volumes, cost improvements, including lower variable compensation and supplies pricing, partially offset by hardware pricing headwinds. Regarding our structural cost saving initiatives, we continued the momentum we had exiting FY '23, making progress in Q1 against our year two goals of our three-year plan. We are on track to deliver on our $1.6 billion gross annual run rate structural cost savings goal exiting 2025, including achieving approximately 30% of those savings in FY '24. Recall that we expect to generate these savings across both our cost of sales and OpEx line items, enhancing our margin performance and enabling investments in our key growth areas. Consistent with previous quarters, we continue to benefit from portfolio simplification initiatives in both Personal Systems and Print, digital transformation, automation and process improvements, leveraging our AI capabilities and structural cost reductions across our business. We still expect to incur one-time restructuring cost of approximately $1 billion over the term of our plan, including approximately $0.3 billion of primarily cash charges in the fiscal year '24. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $120 million and free cash flow was $25 million. Our results were impacted by normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable compensation payments and sequentially lower volumes in Personal Systems. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter. This increased three days sequentially due to days of inventory increasing four days, days payable decreasing one day and days receivable decreasing two days. The increase in DOI was driven primarily by an increase in strategic buys and C shipments during the quarter partially offset by our progress on optimizing our operational inventory, as we have discussed in the past. In Q1, we returned approximately $775 million to shareholders, including $500 million in share repurchases and $275 million in cash dividends. We continue to prudently manage our leverage ratio and finished the quarter within our target leverage range. We resumed share repurchases in Q1, and we expect to return 100% of our FY '24 free cash flow to shareholders. As we have previously stated, we are committed to returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders over time. As long as our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains below 2 times, and unless higher ROI opportunities arise. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY ‘24, we expect the macro and demand environments will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will continue to be very competitive. We remain focused on rigorously managing costs, improving our performance and investing in growth. Specifically, keep the following in mind related to our FY '24 and Q2 financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '24, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we expect the performance in the second-half of fiscal '24 will be seasonally stronger than the first-half. Regarding OI&E expense, we continue to expect it to be approximately $0.7 billion in FY '24. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.6 billion in FY '24 with the second-half of the year stronger than the first. Our free cash flow outlook does include approximately $300 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems. We continue to expect the overall PC market unit TAM to recover over the course of this year, increasing by a low-single-digit percent. Specifically for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will decline sequentially by a high-single-digit, in line with typical seasonality. We expect Personal Systems margins to be solidly within our long-term target range in Q2 as the PC market continues to recover and has strong cost management and pricing actions helped to offset rising commodity costs. For FY ‘24, we expect margins to be solidly within our long-term target range, driven by improved PC market demand, a seasonally stronger second-half of the year, continued mix improvements partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, we expect consumer demand will remain soft and pricing competitive, while market uncertainty continues to impact our commercial print business. Disciplined cost and mix management should help to partially offset these trends, driving flattish revenue sequentially in Q2 below typical seasonality. We expect Q2 supplies revenue to be down mid-single-digit in constant currency, and we still expect Supplies revenue will decline low to mid-single-digits for the year. Quarterly results can vary. For Q2, we expect print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 19% range and solidly within the range for FY '24. We continue to focus on driving print operating profit dollars through new business models and rigorous cost management, including future-ready transformation savings. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2024. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.68. We expect FY ‘24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65 and FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.61 and $3.01. In closing, we started off our new fiscal year making solid progress against our strategic objectives and full year commitments while managing through demand and competitive challenges that have persisted in the current dynamic environment. We remain focused on disciplined execution and cost management and are confident that we have the right people, the right assets and the right strategy to deliver for both our customers and our shareholders for the long-term. I'll stop here so we can open the lines for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be from Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. And sorry, if I'm having an echo, but sorry, that's coming across at your end as well. Maybe just to talk about the expectations for the year you are outlining seasonally strong second half to be the driver of your full year guidance. Maybe you can match that out on something the geography for market consumer or what's in order to decide where you expect people to be stronger second-half to second-half. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.
Enrique Lores: Of course, thank you, Samik, for the question. Let me take that one. So as you say and as we said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting a stronger second half than first-half of the year, and there are multiple drivers for that. First of all, we expect some recovery in the commercial space. Second, also traditional seasonality consumer is stronger in the second half than in the first half. And then internally, we will see more impact from all of our cost reduction efforts that we will also be having a bigger impact in the second half. If we go for the different segments, especially in the PC space, we also expect to see an impact from the winter reference that as you know, will be happening in the coming quarters, and this will have an impact. And then on the print space, mostly on commercial and industrial, we also expect to see some recovery. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Enrique, the share gains you noted in the front end, both in big tank and also in office. What would you attribute that to, given you noted like a very aggressive pricing environment and also a weak period for print hardware. What are some of the levers you're using for some of the share gain.
Enrique Lores: Sure. There are slightly different, Wamsi. On the big tank side, during the last month, we have completed our portfolio. We have now a very complete lineup of products on the low end to products that will also be working on the home office side. And as we have completed that, as we are launching that into the different markets, we are starting to see the impact of the innovation that we brought to market. On the office side, as we highlighted a few quarters ago, we acknowledged that we have some operational work to do to address and to be able to regain some of the share that we have lost. We have been actively working on that. We have started to make progress. We are starting to see that in the progress that we are making quarter-over-quarter. That has been more relevant in some regions like Europe, China, India. But we will continue to work on that because our goal is to continue to regain share in both categories. Thank you.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please Go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the question about second-half strength. It sounds like you expect your printing margins to fall pretty notably in the second half. You were 20% this quarter. We're expecting to be at the high end of the range in the second quarter to be solidly in the range for the second half that would imply printing margins fall considerably. And that's probably possible given that hardware weakness has been pretty strong the last few quarters, and that may translate into weakening supplies growth and therefore, lower margins. So I'm just trying to reconcile if 65% of your profits are going to have lower margins, perhaps notably lower margins in the second half of the year per your guidance? Why are you optimistic? And if I just roll out normal seasonality right now, it points to 4% decline in revenues. Are you expecting revenues to grow in fiscal '24?
Tim Brown: Yes. So let me take that, Toni. First of all, just from a general perspective on print, we do expect to be, as you said, at the high end of the range in Q2 and the -- kind of -- solidly in the range of 16%, 19% for the year. And part of that is driven by what you said where we're trying to drive our mix from a hardware perspective up that does change the rate a little bit. And we aren't changing really what we expect from a supplies perspective where we expect Q2, as I noted in the prepared remarks, to be down mid-single-digits in constant currency and then low to mid-single-digits for the year. So I think that mix is really what's kind of driving the potential for that rate to move back a little bit through the course of the year. From an overall perspective, we expect PS as we said, to be seasonally stronger in the second-half, and that will drive -- and we'll be in the middle point of the range there. And then from a growth perspective, we do expect PS to grow in low single digits, kind of the 2% to 4% range and print will be flattish to down for the course of the year.
Enrique Lores: And Toni, I think another clarification. When we look at H1 '24 versus H1 '23, H2 '24 versus H2 '23, EPS will be growing around 7% in the first-half. If you look at the midpoint of our guide, it will be growing 4% in the midpoint of our guide. So we are expecting growth, but the growth will be slightly lower with the projections that we're making today in the second-half. And as we have said before, we've managed the company to grow operating profit dollars. We don't manage it to deliver on the margin guide we provide. We provide it because we know it's important for modeling, but this is not what the way we manage the company internally.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Lu from UBS. Please go ahead.
Brian Luke: Hey, thank you for taking the question. This is Brian Luke in for David. So in your view, what are the key drivers and milestones for AI-enabled PCs to get traction with commercial customers. Are customers currently in possession of devices today based on the financial benefits of more robust PC.
Enrique Lores: So first of all, let me say that we remain extremely excited about the opportunity that AI PCs will bring in terms of both the customer value that they will deliver in terms of security, in terms of latency, in terms of cost and also the impact it will have over time in the company. I think milestones come from two -- three different angles. First of all, we need to deliver the hardware to be able to support these new models, and we are working on that with the key silicon providers to make sure that we have a wide range of products and a very solid portfolio. Second, we need to make sure that the applications support that and we are working with all the keys of our companies again to make sure they understand the new capabilities and that they build them into their applications. And third is training both in terms of our customers, but also in terms of the sales teams, either HP or the resellers that will be selling that. And we are working on all fronts. Our projections continue to be that three years after launch, the penetration of AI PCs will be somewhere between 40% and 60% of the total sales that we will be making. And that growth is going to be gradual. There will be some impact in '24. But since this will be at the end of the year, fiscal year for us, the impact will be modest. If the impact would be bigger in '25 and the impact will be bigger in '26. But really from both an innovation and customer value is going to be very significant for our portfolio.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great, thank you so much for taking my question. Enrique, you know, again, nice performance on the supply side, you outperformed expectations for a second consecutive quarter. I'm going to ask you the same question I asked you last quarter, which is just if you can talk about the four-box model and kind of the different factors that are impacting supplies performance? And then if we kind of port that over to the rest of the year, you've been flat to growing over the last quarters on the supply side. What are the factors that are driving the deceleration to low to mid-single-digit declines for the entirety of the year, implying the rest of the year deteriorates from here? Thanks so much.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Erik. And my answer is going to be very similar to the answer I gave you last quarter. So first of all, let me also share that, as we have said many times, looking at quarter-on-quarter comparisons is not a bad way to understand the health of the projections for the Supplies business because each quarter, many things happened that have an impact on the growth comparison quarter-on-quarter. And second, we are not changing the long-term projections for supplies of low to mid-single-digit decline nor the projections that we have for 24, but also, we expect it to be low single low to mid-single digits and no changes in our projections. In terms of what of the performance this quarter, there are as always multiple factors. First of all, we continue to manage our share and to gain share of supplies. This has always a positive impact. Second, pricing, we have made some pricing adjustments that are having positive impact and also at last quarter, we need to acknowledge that the compare is easy because supplies were declining in Q1 '23, so that comparison is also positive. On the other side, again, similar to what we discussed last quarter, we continue to see negative impact from usage and negative impact from the size of the installed base that has been shrinking. And then maybe to close a comment on channel inventory that I know is something of interest, channel inventory for supplies and actually for the rest of the business, stays in a very healthy position. So we are in a good position there. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Lauren Lucas: This is Lauren on for Amit. I was wondering if you guys could talk a bit about what gives a few conviction for the recovery in the commercial space given the pockets of weakness that you guys saw in Q1? Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. So first of all, I think we -- I would like to start by acknowledging that it's not only our projection, but it's really the projection that we see from industry analysts and also from the rest of the key players in the industry and there are multiple factors. I mentioned before the fact that we expect to see more impact from the Windows refresh cycle that is starting, and this will have a bigger impact on the second-half. We also expect to see a positive impact from pricing and mix, given that we expect component cost to increase, but this will also have a positive impact. And then when we look at what we saw this quarter, we have seen more stability on the SMB space. We have seen also more stability in the education space. We started to see growth in Europe on the PC side that has not happened in a long time. So while we continue to see some areas of weakness like China or, for example, the federal business in the U.S. that we saw softness in January. We continue to believe that the overall market will be improving in the second-half. Thank you.
Lauren Lucas: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for taking my question. If I may, just given the conviction that you have that commercial will see improvement, maybe if you could talk a little bit about the peripheral side of your business, how that track. And overall, how did the growth portion of your business do as we started the year in '24, in fiscal '24?
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, thank you, Asiya. So let's see, in terms of peripherals, as you are indicating, they have been impacted by the cautiousness that we have seen on the commercial side. And as the commercial market will recover, we expect them -- they will be recovering as well. And this is why we have continued to invest in innovation in these categories because we think that long term is a great growth opportunity for us, and this is confirmed both by our customers, our clients and also by resellers. In terms of the growth areas we -- several of them started to grow, which was really a very positive sign. We -- and for example, we -- for me, personally the fact that both services businesses, both our Workforce Solutions business, and our Consumer Services business grew in Q1 is a very important sign of recovery, also because of the strategic importance that this business has for the medium and long-term for the company. And I think something I would like to highlight to close is tomorrow, we are going to be launching on the consumer services side, the first subscription where we will be integrating hardware into the plan is something that we shared at our Investor Day. Finally, we will be releasing that tomorrow. And again, it's an important step because you know that one of the key directions we have for the long term is to offer our full portfolio as a subscription. And this will be the first time we are offering for consumers our hardware as well, and you will see us expanding the line over time.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the commentary around Personal Systems pricing. What drove some of the pricing dynamics in the quarter? I know you guys called out improved commercial mix, but there was also an unfavorable mix shift in consumer. Could you provide a little bit more color there? And maybe just talk a little bit more about your outlook for ASP for the full-year, whether for the industry or for HP. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So let me start and maybe Tim will be making additional comments. When we look at Q1 performance quarter-over-quarter, which we think is the best indicator to look at -- to monitor progress. PC prices were flattish, driven by commercial. Commercial prices were up and the mix moved a bit to consumer, when -- which means that from a mix perspective, we saw a positive impact. But at the same time, rates were down, mostly driven by price pressure that we saw in the low end of the portfolio, especially in the consumer side. And we think that this is a consequence of some of the softness that we saw in some of the consumer markets during the last quarter. But going forward, as commodity costs will increase and also as we see price as mix will evolve more towards commercial, we expect to see an overall increase of PC prices.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is [Stephen] (ph) calling on behalf of Chris. Enrique, I wanted to ask you about the print business. In terms of the [Technical Difficulty] that you come [Technical Difficulty] your Japanese peers, I was wondering if you're also seeing that applied on the commercial and supply hardware and also supply portion of your commercial business, especially within the context of any long-term managed contracts and work for solutions? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. So far, the pressure that we are seeing is mostly on the consumer side. And this is very similar to the trend that we explained last quarter where we -- given where the exchange rate between dollar and yen and euro and yes. Clearly, this is giving a strong advantage to some of our competitors in that space, and we are seeing that in the prices that they are going after. And this is why in the consumer side, you have seen us especially on the more traditional categories we have decided not to go after certain deals because these will be unprofitable customers that we are not interested in targeting. On the commercial side, we have seen more stability. There might be some risk of stabilization. We have some of that in our modeling, but all of this is built into the guide that we have provided today.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron, your line is open.
Jacob Wilhelm: Hi, sorry about that. This is Jake on for Aaron. I was just hoping you can get some additional color on your industrial graphics business. It seems like over the past few quarters, you're seeing a little bit more momentum there. So I was just hoping to see how you need it throughout the remainder of the year?
Enrique Lores: Yes. Thank you. So you said it well. We have started to see some momentum in that part of the business. especially in the labels and packaging side, we have seen some good recovery. And we -- you know that we -- in May '24, there is this big show called [Drupal] (ph), which is like the print -- major printing event and happens every 4 years. We are -- we have prepared a lot of new products and services that we will be launching them. And they usually have a fairly positive impact in the quarters after that. So we are expecting to see that happening in '24. But good recovery and very good expectations for '24 as Drupal as we will be launching a new set of products and solutions there.
Operator: That concludes the question-and-answer session today. I will now turn the call back over to Enrique Lores for closing remarks.
Enrique Lores: Perfect. Thank you. So thank you all for joining today. And I'd like to close with 3 messages. First of all, as you saw, Q1 was a solid quarter and a solid way to start the year, where we grew both operating profit and EPS. We remain positive about the outlook that we provided a few quarters, a few months ago about the rest of the year. And as we said, we expect -- continue to expect a stronger second-half than first-half. And we also remain very confident in the long-term, especially driven by the opportunities at both hybrid work and AI are bringing to us as a company and the innovation that we are going to be launching around that. So Again, thank you for joining us today and looking forward to continue to talk in the future. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q4  (2023-11-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2023 HP Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Krista, and I'll be your conference moderator for today. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's fourth quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining our final earnings call of 2023. It was great to host many of you for our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. As I said at the time, we have made significant progress against our strategic priorities. And we see attractive opportunities ahead. Our Future Ready plan, combined with our relentless focus on the things we can control, enable us to make steady progress against our plan in fiscal year '23. We are very pleased with our Q4 results, and we have finished the year in a much stronger position than we began. We knew from the start that it could be a tough year. The challenging external environment constrained demand across the industry, and this is reflected in our full-year results. Net revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14%. We executed well in the face of these market dynamics, growing non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially throughout the year. And our second-half results were significantly stronger than the first. We also made good progress in our key growth areas, which grew mid-single digits and drove approximately 20% of our total company revenue for the year. Our plan is designed to grow these businesses to at least $15 billion in revenue by the end of fiscal year '26. And we over-delivered on our gross annualized structural cost savings plan, putting us well on-track to achieve our recently increased three-year target of $1.6 billion. Our results reinforce our confidence in the financial outlook we shared with you in October. And I want to say a big thank you to our entire HP team for paving the way toward our next phase of growth. I'm going to use my time today to summarize our Q4 performance, provide insight into each of our segments and reiterate some of the thoughts I shared last month about the market in 2024. Let me start with Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion, that was down 6% year-over-year due to the expected market dynamics we discussed last quarter. Revenue grew 5% sequentially, reflecting our progress. I want to mention our key growth areas. Collectively, they grew 10% sequentially or 2 times faster than our total company growth. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, up 5% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. And free cash flow was strong at $1.9 billion, enabling us to meet our full-year target of approximately $3 billion. I'm particularly pleased with the strength of our innovation. It was on display at our HP Imagine event last month, where we gathered media and industry analysts from around the world to showcase more than 20 new products and services. This included the Spectre Fold, a device that reflects HP's culture of innovation at its best. Seamlessly transforming from laptop to tablet to desktop, it has widespread recognition as one of the most innovative form factors the industry has seen. And it recently received by Red Dot Design Award, one of the highest honors in industrial design. We also continue to build momentum in AI. We are the first company to offer dedicated workstation solutions with NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software. And more broadly, we're advancing our work to create the AI PC category. We have built the widest range of client product based on Intel's next-generation of processors, Intel Core Ultra. Giving us a strong foundation on which to build, but we co-engineer and commercialize new AI architectures next year. And I am very encouraged by the work underway with all of our silicon and software partners. The emergence of the AI PC in 2024 will start a new cycle of market expansion and refresh. As I shared last month, we believe this can double the overall PC category growth rate over the next three years. In Print, we have refreshed our entire A3 and A4 portfolio, making devices smaller, more modular and easier to manage and secure. We also continue to leverage our IP to create new categories. This includes our SitePrint construction solution, which has already laid out more than 1 million square feet at construction site in North America and the U.K., and is launching in new geographies. We expanded our Poly solutions for large conference rooms and small hidden spaces. We also launched a new conference room as-a-service subscription to help customers optimize usage and create better employee experiences. And we launched HP Workforce Central, which integrates data for more than 60 service tools across PCs, printers and Poly devices into a single platform. These will drive simplicity, productivity and security for IT departments. We're in beta with over 2,000 customers and we'll be rolling it out to all managed solution accounts. As we innovate across our portfolio, we remain equally focused on our sustainable impact priorities. A great example is our recently announced HP Renew solutions. By enhancing our refurbishing capabilities, we are now able to extend the life of devices and drive peculiarity upscale. In addition to supporting our sustainability goals, this reduces total cost of ownership and create an accretive business. We have launched in India and we'll be expanding into other markets during fiscal year '24. We're also playing an active role to support our communities. Right now, we are particularly focused on the needs of those suffering in Israel and Gaza. Since the attacks of October 7, our number one priority has been the safety and well-being of our employees in the region. I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work our team is doing to keep our business in Israel fully operational in the face to an extremely difficult situation. HP Foundation has committed $1 million to humanitarian relief partners in the region. We will continue doing everything we can to support our local teams. Let me now turn to our business unit performance. The external environment remains consistent with what we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. Our baseline scenario of market stabilization across fiscal year '24 has not changed. And our markets largely behave as we expected in Q4. Consumer showed a more typical seasonal uptick. Commercial customers remain cautious, but we saw some signs of stabilization especially in Personal Systems. And we continue to see demand weakness in China due to challenging economic conditions. Personal Systems net revenue was $9.4 billion in the quarter, that's down 8% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. But what's most important is we continue to drive significant sequential improvement in the business, with PS revenue up 5% quarter-over-quarter. Our disciplined execution delivered strong PS operating margin of 6.7%. We once again gained share in Commercial and Consumer year-over-year. We saw a continued recovery in Consumer and Gaming, both of which grew double-digits sequentially. And through our stepped-up focus on Workforce Solutions, we grew our PS Service TCV double-digits, including new wins with several large global customers spanning multiple industries. Hybrid systems grew sequentially, largely driven by seasonality in consumer peripherals. This market is currently impacted by enterprise spending, but we remain bullish on the long-term growth opportunity and the breadth of our offering across hardware peripherals and services is a huge advantage. Turning to Print. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, that's down 3% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. Print revenue grew 4% sequentially, while units were flat. Supplies revenue was up in constant currency in Q4 on an easier compare and finished the year down 1% in constant currency, in-line with our long-term outlook. We drove strong Print operating margins of 18.9%, reflecting disciplined execution and cost management. HP+ enabled and big tank printers, once again comprise approximately 60% of our shipments. Instant Ink delivered another quarter of revenue and subscriber growth year-over-year, and we drove strong momentum in Workforce Solutions with double-digit TCV growth and significant new MPS wins. We remain focused on regaining profitable Print share and improving our performance in office, and we are starting to see the impact of our efforts, with solid share recovery in Americas, parts of Europe and China quarter-over-quarter, as well as strong share gains in A3. Our industrial graphics business returned to growth year-over-year and was up double digits sequentially, including continued recovery in labels and packaging. And while 3D is impacted by the current environment, we continue to build momentum in the market. At Formnext earlier this month, we showcased our work with partners and customers like BMW, Decathlon and Siemens, to scale our 3D solution. Overall, Q4 was a solid quarter. We are showing the resilience, agility and operational rigor, needed to win in the market, while advancing our long-term growth priorities. And we feel good about the outlook we shared with you in October. We also remain committed to returning at least 100% of free cash flow, over time, unless opportunities with a higher return on investment arise, and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. We expect to resume share repurchases in Q1. Let me close by reiterating something I said at our Securities Analyst Meeting. HP is a compelling investment. We have market-leading portfolios in the PC and print categories, and we are well positioned to drive profitable growth in our core markets going forward. We have significant opportunities to accelerate in our key growth areas. We have world-class operational capabilities to deliver on our targets and reduce our structural costs. And we have a shareholder-friendly capital return strategy. These are core strengths of HP. Our Q4 and fiscal year '23 results reflect the consistent progress we are making. And we are confident in our plan to deliver sustained revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow growth. Let me now turn the call over to Marie for a deeper dive into the numbers.
Marie Myers: Thanks, Enrique, and good afternoon, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you all today. We delivered another strong quarter financially, due to outstanding operational execution and good progress in our Future Ready transformation. We generated solid results across revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, building on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding our goals. Our team is executing well despite the challenging macro environment, delivering Q4 sequential growth in revenue and non-GAAP operating profit dollars in both Personal Systems and Print. Margins were at or above the high-end of our ranges, resulting in a return to year-over-year growth in non-GAAP EPS, while free cash flow more than doubled sequentially, consistent with our outlook. We exceeded our Future Ready transformation cost savings target for fiscal '23 and are on track in '24 to continue reducing our structural costs while investing in our key growth areas. While we continue to monitor economic indicators and geopolitical risks, we're pleased with the momentum and health of our business. We will continue our efforts to drive fundamental improvements to our cost structure longer term, while prudently and aggressively managing near-term expenses. With the savings we generate, we'll continue to focus on prioritizing our investments, so that we are well positioned to deliver on the longer-term financial outlook, we outlined at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. Now, let me begin by providing some additional color on our results. Starting with the full year, we stayed focused on what we could control, disciplined execution and cost management, and we delivered solid performance despite the macroeconomic and competitive dynamics we faced. Revenue was $53.7 billion, down 15% nominally and down 12% in constant currency. Revenue in our key growth areas grew mid-single digits, constituting approximately 20% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating profit was $4.6 billion, down 14% or 8.5% of total revenue, flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP net earnings per share was down 18% to $3.28. We generated $3.1 billion of free cash flow, consistent with our full-year guidance. And we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders and raised our dividend by 5%. Now, let's take a closer look at the details of Q4. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 6% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Year-over-year declines improved sequentially across each of our regions in constant currency: Americas declined 6%; EMEA declined 2%; and APJ declined 8%, as demand remained soft in China. Gross margin was 21.6% in the quarter, up 3.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs and a favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by reinvestment of some Future Ready savings in growth initiatives, investment in people and one extra month of Poly, offset in part by structural and other cost reductions. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, up 11.5%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $173 million, up sequentially due largely to higher currency losses and up year-on-year due to higher currency losses and factoring costs. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.08 or 10% to $0.90, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $72 million, primarily related to tax adjustment related credits and pension and post-retirement benefit, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.97. Now, let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $9.4 billion, down 8% or 7% in constant currency, but up 5% sequentially, reflecting seasonal strength ahead of the holiday season. Total units were flat on a net basis with Commercial down 6% and Consumer up 9%. Nevertheless, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q3 on a year-over-year basis for the third consecutive quarter. And year-over-year Commercial revenue declines stabilized sequentially even as Commercial customers remain cautious. Drilling into the details, Consumer revenue was down 1% and Commercial was down 11%, driven by lower TAM, increased competitive pricing and unfavorable mix, offset in part by market share gains in both Consumer and Commercial. Strong profit and margin results in both customer segments were driven by our emphasis on profitable growth and effective cost management. Competitive pricing pressures eased somewhat in Q4, resulting in increased ASPs, contributing to the sequential improvement in Personal Systems revenue this quarter, consistent with our outlook. Our channel inventory is back to normalized levels. Personal Systems delivered $631 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.7%. Our margin increased 2.5 points year-over-year, primarily due to lower commodity and logistics costs and structural cost savings. This was partially offset by mix, currency and investment in people. Sequentially, our operating margin held firm towards the high-end of our target range, driven by strong profitability in both our Consumer and Commercial business segments. In Print, our results reflect our continued focus on execution and disciplined cost management, as we navigate a weak and competitive print market. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.4 billion, down 3% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share loss and currency, offset partially by supplies revenue growth. Hardware revenue was down $188 million, driven by lower volumes, attributable largely to continued soft demand in Greater Asia and China and share loss as our Japanese competitors continued to price aggressively. Total hardware units decreased 19% year-over-year. Industrial graphics finished the year positively with revenue returned to growth in Q4, driven by hardware and services with performance improvements across all major geographical regions. By customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 4% on a reported basis and in constant currency with units down 24%. Consumer revenue decreased 21% or down 19% in constant currency with units down 18%. Demand for traditional home ink printers remain soft but was offset partially by increased demand for big tank printers. In office hardware, ASPs were up double-digit year-over-year as favorable mix, offset competitive pricing and currency headwinds driven by improved contractual A3 demand across multiple markets. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, increasing 3% nominally and 4% in constant currency. For FY '23, supplies revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis, in-line with our long-term outlook of down low- to mid-single digits. Print operating profit was approximately $836 million, down 6% year-over-year, and operating margin was 18.9%, Operating margin decreased 0.8 points, driven by investments in people, competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by favorable mix and cost reductions. Turning to our Future Ready transformation plan. We successfully completed the first year of our three-year program and delivered better-than-expected performance against our goals for fiscal year '23. Given the strong progress we made during the year and confidence we have to drive additional structural cost savings, we recently raised our cumulative program target to $1.6 billion. In FY '23, we generated gross annual run rate structural cost savings across COGS and OpEx, exceeding our revised target. Let me briefly recap some key accomplishments across each of the three core pillars of our program that we achieved during fiscal '23. Under our operational excellence pillar, we continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our businesses, particularly in corporate. We embraced hybrid work, enabling us to rationalize our real estate portfolio, executing 13 site consolidations or exits during the year. We also simplified our go-to-market organization, including streamlining our management structure. We made solid progress on our digital transformation efforts by driving additional automation and process improvements. We modernized our data infrastructure to leverage AI machine learning to deliver richer, data-driven insights from business decisions. Looking ahead, we are accelerating our generative AI capabilities, including rolling out AI tools like GitHub Copilot to approximately half of our developers as well as implementing HP-specific large language models to improve efficiencies through a chatbot for our sales and service representatives. Further, there are significant opportunities ahead, across many additional use cases. Our third pillar is focused on simplifying our product portfolio, significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. In FY '23, the actions we took in Personal Systems continued to impact our overall performance. At the end of FY '23, we were approximately halfway to our year-end FY '24 goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately one-third. In addition, we made great progress reducing our commodity complexity by decreasing the number of client SKUs at our Personal Systems portfolio. We expect these initiatives will optimize our overall supplier ecosystem, increase our supply chain efficiency and drive better forecast capabilities. And in Print, by rationalizing our investments, we plan to simplify our Print portfolio to drive a 40% reduction in ink hardware platforms shipped by FY '25. As we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting, we see significant opportunities ahead of us to focus on our Future Ready plan and position the company to optimize our cost structure and enhance our margin performance. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was strong at $2 billion, and free cash flow was $1.9 billion, on the strength of the sequential growth in Personal Systems. Free cash flow for fiscal year '23 was approximately $3.1 billion, consistent with our outlook. The cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days in the quarter. This improved three days year-over-year, driven exclusively by an increase in days payable. In Q4, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, given that we were in possession of material non-public information, but we expect to resume repurchases in Q1 and be active throughout FY '24. For fiscal year '23, we returned greater than $1.1 billion to shareholders and retired $1.6 billion of debt. Regarding FY '24, we are reiterating our outlook provided at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month. We intend to return approximately 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders next year, as long as our debt-to-EBITDA ratio remains under 2x and unless higher ROI opportunities arise, such as strategic acquisitions. Looking forward to FY '24, consistent with what we said at our October Securities Analyst Meeting, we assume the market will stabilize in our base case scenario, underlying that outlook for Personal Systems is for revenues to grow in-line with the personal systems market and for Print revenue to be in line with the print market. We expect operating margins for both Personal Systems and Print to be solidly within their respective target ranges, as we continue to manage costs and pricing in this dynamic and uncertain environment. Regarding our non-GAAP FY '24 EPS outlook, consistent with historical seasonality, we expect second-half performance will be greater than the first half. As we said at our Security Analyst Meeting, we expect corporate other expense for fiscal '24 to be relatively flat year-over-year at approximately $1 billion. Keep in mind that due to the timing of stock compensation expense, we expect approximately one-third of FY '24's corporate other expense in Q1. And in Q1, we expect the economic and demand environment to remain challenging but stable. As we continue to manage cost aggressively to help offset some of these pressures, we expect our operating profit margins for both Personal System and Print to be toward the high end of their respective target ranges for the quarter. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q1 and fiscal year 2024. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86, and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.70. We expect FY '24 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.65, and FY '24, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.08. In summary, we are pleased with our Q4 results, as we delivered on our commitments, even in light of the continued challenging macro environment. Our longer-term financial framework that we outlined at our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, remains unchanged, and we have good momentum to execute on our near-term FY '24 objectives. Our focus remains on profitable growth in the higher value segments of the market and structural cost savings across our P&L, while returning 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today is Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering maybe you could help us think through the seasonality. Obviously, it's been -- for the first half versus second half, what's implied in your guidance? If we go back a few years, the low 50% of EPS was recognized in the second half versus first half. So, I'm wondering if you could maybe either characterize it that way or second half versus first half on a growth basis on earnings. And maybe within that context you can just give us some sense the commercial PC market continues to be quite weak. I know, Marie, you said that the guidance for fiscal '24 bakes an in-line with market performance. But can you be somewhat explicit about what that performance is in commercial PCs in your fiscal year guide? Thank you so much.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. So, Wamsi, hi, this is Enrique. Let me provide a view on macro, and then Marie will be more specific about seasonality on EPS, because I think it will help to understand it better. So, from a macro perspective, what we saw in Q4 is an increase in seasonality, especially for PCs, between Q3 and Q4. And also, on the commercial side, we saw stability of sales. Market continued to remain soft, but especially when we look at real end user demand, we saw demand being stable. And somehow this helps us in the projection that we have for next year. As we discussed before, we expect the PC market to be slightly growing from 2024 to 2023, and the print market to be about flat to slightly decline between '24 and '25 -- '24 and '23, and we expect both segments to improve gradually through the year. So, having said that context, Marie will address the EPS question.
Marie Myers: Yeah, no, good afternoon. So, let me walk you through how to think about seasonality. If you take the midpoint of that guide, which is what we gave at SAM, which is the $3.45, if you take the midpoint, basically you can assume the macro is stabilizing. And also, we expect the revenue to improve over the course of the year. So, I would just say we're not back yet quite to normal seasonal patterns, but we're definitely expecting the back half to improve over the first half. So, think about a gradual recovery over the year. But I'll just add, as we think about the Q1 guide, particularly for Personal Systems, I would say at this point, we don't expect that normal seasonality yet due to the pace of the market recovery. So, we're going to see that quarter-on-quarter differential relative to the Q4 period that we've just come out of. So, same guide unchanged, but definitely still not quite back to normal seasonality yet throughout the year.
Wamsi Mohan: Thanks, Enrique. Thanks, Marie.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Marie Myers: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryani from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess my question is just on the Print side. Enrique, I'm hoping you could just touch on what do you seeing from a competitive perspective, given a lot of your peers are in Japan, who are probably leveraging the weaker currency, I think, on the pricing side. I'd love to understand how you're reacting to that. And then really how do you maintain the operating margin of this run rate, given the pricing headwinds -- or competitive headwinds that you have? Maybe you can just touch up on that. And then, Marie, could you just maybe flush out free cash flow? If there are any seasonality we should be cognizant about in Q1 versus rest of the year, that would be helpful. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: So, let me start on Print. So, not much has changed since we met a few weeks ago. So, we continue to see a competitive environment on the Print side, especially driven by the current situation between yen and dollar. But I have to say, between Q3 and Q4, we didn't see more aggressive pricing. If anything, prices sequentially improved Q3 to Q4. We have not seen an increase in competition from that perspective. When we look at '24 and the actions that we are taking to compensate for a potential more pricing increase, we are going to be executing the plan that we described before. We have an aggressive cost reduction plan that will help us to manage that. We continue to drive the shift toward HP+ units and profit upfront units that will also help from that perspective. And we continue to drive -- and we expect to grow share in the office space, which will be a contributor of margin improvement. And finally, as we shared in our prepared remarks, we have seen an improvement of the performance of the industrial business. We have seen a recovery of the market. And within the market, we have grown both hardware and consumption. And we think this is going to help us also in 2024.
Marie Myers: Yeah, and just a couple of points on the Print rate. So, as we guided in SAM, we're still very confident in the outlook we gave around the revised range on Print. And as a result of that, we do expect in Q1 to still be at the high-end of that range, and then in '24, we expect to be solidly in the range. So, just keep that in mind as you're working through your model. And then, with respect to cash flow and the comments on seasonalities, we're reiterating our guide that we had at SAM of $3.10 to $3.60. And I just add from a seasonality perspective, just always bear in mind that Q1, we do expect cash flow to be lower, and that's due to the fact that we always accrue for our bonus in the prior period, and we typically pay that out in Q1 of the current year. So, expect that Q1 free cash flow will therefore be somewhat lower. But, similarly, as I said in SAM, we expect it to be in-line with net earnings and continue to see those fluctuations around working capital throughout the remaining quarters.
Amit Daryani: Perfect. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.
Krish Sankar: Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Enrique, I had a question on the PC side. You said you're expecting modest growth next year. I'm kind of curious, is there a way to quantify it? And how much is AI driving it? And also, when it comes to AI PC, how much kind of an uplift in ASP do you expect versus regular PC? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: So, let me start by saying that we are really excited about the impact that AI PCs are going to have in the overall PC category. As we have shared before, we think that they will drive -- they will double the expected growth from '24 to '26. So, it's really going to have significant impact. If we talk about '24, we think the impact will be smaller just because of: first, timing, the first AI PC will be introduced in the second half; and second, because of penetration, when we launch a new category, we know also it takes time for the category to penetrate. Our expectation is that in three years, 40% to 60% of the PCs will be AI PC, but it's going to be a gradual penetration of the category. But again, we are really excited, not only because of the impact that it will have on the business, but also because of the value -- additional value this is going to bring to our customers.
Krish Sankar: Can you really quantify the ASP uplift?
Enrique Lores: Thank you. Yes. So, what we had said before, and we haven't changed our projection is, average selling price for PCs will increase between 5% and 10%, as a consequence of the penetration of AI PC. Thank you.
Krish Sankar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on supplies growth in the quarter. It was up sequentially. That hasn't happened in -- at any point in the last 10 years on an organic basis. So, what was driving the non-seasonal growth in supplies? Did you change prices and people bought in before? Or was there some channel fill? And then, could you also just comment on -- you talked a lot about Future Ready and the strength. I think you've taken out maybe run rate about $600 million worth of costs. But OpEx is essentially identical to the first quarter of this year. So, when we think about Future Ready, should we actually think about OpEx going down in fiscal '24? Or we won't see the impact of Future Ready on OpEx? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yeah. Hi, Toni. Good afternoon. So, let me just start out with the question on Future Ready. So first of all, obviously, really pleased with the performance, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, for '23. And then, going into '24, as you know, we raised our target to $1.6 million in SAM. So, very much on track. And I think as we've discussed at SAM, Future Ready is a combination of both OpEx and cost of sales. So, some of those savings, we're reinvesting back in growth and in people to help us manage through some of the volatility, but we do also drop that through to the bottom-line. And frankly, Toni, you can see that in the rates that we even delivered in this last quarter and also in terms of how we're guiding the rates going forward in terms of solidly in the range for the year and really at the high-end of the range for both businesses in Q1. Now, OpEx will be up year-on-year, and it's driven by exactly those factors I mentioned earlier, the investments in our growth, the investments in our people. And I would just sort of add as a sort of closing comment around this is, if you look at the geography of the P&L, you could see in our gross margins that we're shifting out now to higher gross margins, and that's been partially offset by operating expenses. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit more context around how to think about Future Ready. And I'll turn it back to Enrique on supplies. I'll just add on the supplies' ecosystem, we're in good shape, Toni. From a multi-tier perspective, we ended the quarter in good shape.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. So, let me complement that. So, I think there are multiple factors that drove the good performance of supplies in Q4. As I have said many times though, when we look at year-on-year compares, it's not the best way to look at the performance in a quarter because there are many adjustments that are done every quarter, and then comparisons can all -- can distort the overall perspective. We are driving many positive actions on supplies. We continue to grow share overall, which is something that we have been doing already for several quarters. We have increased prices to reflect the value that we bring. So, the combination of all these things help us to grow supplies quarter-on-quarter. And again, we are pleased with the performance. But in the long term, we continue to expect the supplies to decline low- to mid-single digits. We are not changing our projections for supplies in the future.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the opportunity. A little bit on inventory. If you could just comment on how you look at the inventory in the channel, both on the PC and the Personal -- on the Print side as well? Specifically, in PCs, I think there was commentary that there was some elevated ones, when you spoke about it last quarter, not for HP but generally for the industry in general. And then, if you can just talk about the cadence of EPS? As you progress, if the second half is going to be stronger, I think, as was commented earlier, you're starting the first year -- first quarter up 10%, if math is correct, and you're ending for the year at 5% for the year. So, if you can just kind of walk through that, that would be great. Thank you.
Marie Myers: So -- good afternoon, Asiya. So, why don't I just start out on the EPS sort of seasonality and how to think about it. So, in terms of Q1, just to sort of give you some context there, a third -- we usually have corporate other expense that hits in -- from a seasonality perspective, a third of that hits in Q1. So, if you look at our Q1 guide, just bear that in mind because that's typically the stock comp expense period. So, as a result of that, you're going to see that seasonality adjustment in our Q1 EPS. And as you correctly said, we're actually up, I think, 11% on the midpoint year-on-year in our Q1. But we're -- SAM guide, I'll just reiterate, of $325 million to $365 million, hasn't changed. And just to close, Q1 is just really typical seasonality. And then, if you think about channel inventory, both Personal Systems and Print were in really healthy shape, and we're pleased with where we landed in terms of the progress we made this quarter. I would add on Personal Systems that we've seen declines sequentially and that we are really now back to much more normalized levels. And in fact, the industry levels themselves are also normalizing. And you can see that in terms of the quality of our pricing in the last quarter as well. So, I think looking back, we've seen CI really return back to more normalized levels, particularly in Personal Systems and in Print as well.
Asiya Merchant: Great. And if I can squeeze one more in on components, deflationary expectations, I think there was some commentary previously on how you think about components.
Marie Myers: Yes. It's very much in-line with our SAM guide in terms of forward-looking. We expect both Print and PS to be headwinds for the year. And as we look into Q1, we do expect a headwind in PS, but a slight tailwind on Print. And then, in terms of just what you've seen in the quarter, we've seen tailwinds -- sorry, tailwinds and favorability on Print as well, but definitely headwinds for both businesses for the year.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Jake on for Aaron. Thanks for the question. I was hoping you could give some additional color on the amount of promotional pricing for PCs you expect to see heading into the holiday season and maybe how this could compare to prior years.
Enrique Lores: We expect to see a similar level of aggressiveness that we were seeing before channel inventory was high. And at this point, what we know about the holiday season is that based on the selling, the shipments we have been making, the strength of our portfolio, we have very good assortment on the stores. We have just introduced significant innovation across our full portfolio. So, we are optimistic about the holiday season in the coming weeks.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks. And then, I was also wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the growth you're seeing in Poly and maybe some of the momentum you expect with the new as-a-service subscription offering.
Enrique Lores: Sure. We continue to be very bullish about the opportunities that we have with the Poly business. Of course, during the last week, it has been impacted -- during the last quarter, it has been impacted by macro. But feedback we get from our channel, from our customers continues to be very positive. As you said, we just introduced both new technology in the systems and the new as-a-service model, which we think will help us to drive growth in 2024. And really the opportunity to grow and to innovate continues to be there. From a process perspective, we are now finishing the IT integration based on the plan that we shared a few quarters ago. We have been driving the process as per plan. And again, we are happy with the progress we have made. I'm really optimistic about the opportunities this business is going to bring to us.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Great, thank you very much for taking my question. I just wanted to circle back to Toni's question on Print supplies. You obviously outperformed Print supplies this quarter. So, I just wanted to make sure I understood specifically, what drove the upside in the quarter. And given hard -- Print hardware units are declining 20% year-over-year, should -- what are the offsets to that as we think about supplies in the Four Box Model? I think you mentioned share gains in pricing. But if you could just go through kind of all the four different factors just to make sure we understand the different drivers, that would be helpful, for '24. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Perfect. Thank you, Erik. And thank you because when I was answering to Toni, I missed to mention one of the elements that also helped, which is the easy compare, because last -- Q4 last year was not a strong quarter for supplies. So, this also has an impact on the year-on-year compare. If I -- if we look at the Four Box Model and the different drivers of supplies, clearly, installed base has continued to decline. So, this is a negative factor. Usage continues to go down, which is a negative factor, though I have to say, continues to be above, especially the home, in space, the references and the projections that we were making before the pandemic. And then, two positive factors that have had an impact this quarter; one is pricing, we have increased prices for supplies, and market share. As I mentioned before, we have continued to grow share for supplies, which has a positive impact on the overall supplies growth. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mike Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. I just have one for Marie and one for Enrique. Marie, you guided to PS and Print margins to be at the high-end of the range for the fiscal first quarter and then solidly in the range for the full year. Can you talk about some of the factors that drive that margin normalization for each of those two segments throughout the year? And then, Enrique, within Commercial Printing, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about any differences in outlook for A3 versus A4, or are the competitive dynamics very similar. Thank you very much.
Marie Myers: Yes, sure, Mike. Good afternoon. Why don't I start out and give you some context on the ranges and how we're thinking about them. So, on PS, as we mentioned, we'd be at the high-end for Q1, and really what's driving that is just a combination of the mix. I think you heard Enrique talked to that in his prepared remarks, in terms of the higher value and also the improved pricing on -- as channel inventories normalizes. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a sequential improvement, and we expect, as a result, to see less promotional pricing. And then obviously, we've got the benefits of the Future Ready program that I talked about a moment ago with Toni. Obviously, also working against that are the headwinds that we've got with commodity costs and some of that is really what's influencing the sort of seasonality of the rates that we see in terms of being more solidly in the range as the year progresses. So that's sort of Personal Systems. And if you think about Print, similar drivers in terms of just being at the high-end of the range for Q1, and it's really driven by the profitability that we talked about, the shift in the model with supplies, some of the new business models. Also, frankly, the impact of growth is having an impact on both businesses. Similarly, the impact of the Future Ready. And once again, we also see pricing normalization and we see supplies -- there is no change to the supplies outlook to -- in terms of low- to mid-single digits. So, all those factors together is what really drives us to see both businesses be solidly in the range for the year, but at the high-end of the range for Q1. I'll turn it to Erique.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. And just in your question about the office market in Print, two key comments. One is we have continued to shift change from A3 to A4, especially in Commercial -- in large Commercial customers. We think this is driven by the fact that we expect to see less printing -- people in the office. And therefore, they have reduced the printing volumes that they were expecting and they need less production type of products. So that has been one change. Second, in terms of both A4 and A3, we continue to see an opportunity to grow share. We did it in this quarter in A3, and we have started to grow our share in A4 in several geographies. We did it in North America -- in Americas. We did it in several countries in Europe. We did it in China. And we know we have some work to do, but we expect to continue to drive that during 2024.
Mike Ng: Great. Thank you, Enrique. Thank you, Marie.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Enrique Lores for closing remarks.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. Well, first of all, thank you, all of you for joining. With the Q4 results, we believe are a signal of the progress that we are making and increase the confidence that we have in the plan that we shared with all of you a few weeks ago. And this reinforces the key message that we shared at SAM, that we believe that HP shares are undervalued and continue to be a good investment. And then last but not least, for those of you in the U.S., let me close the call wishing all of you a very happy Thanksgiving. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-29 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2023 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago period. In addition, unless otherwise noted, references to HP channel inventory refer to Tier 1 channel inventory. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. When we spoke last quarter, we said that our second half performance would be stronger than the first half. We outlined a clear plan to drive sequential improvement and this is exactly what we delivered in Q3. We grew net revenue, non-GAAP operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow quarter-over-quarter in a tough market environment. And our Future Ready plan is enabling continued progress against our long-term growth priorities while driving structural cost savings. Today, I'm going to spend a few minutes recapping Q3. I will then talk about the market dynamics we see in each of our business units. And I will close by sharing my thoughts on the external environment heading into Q4 before handing the call to Marie. Starting with our results, net revenue was $13.2 billion. That's down 10% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Even so, third quarter net revenue was up 2% sequentially despite macro headwinds continuing to impact demand across the industry. We also made good progress in our key growth areas. While these businesses are not immune to [covering] (ph) market challenges, collectively, they delivered solid sequential growth in the quarter. This reflects the power of the portfolio we are building to meet a wider range of customer needs. And we are continuing to invest in these areas to strengthen our position and accelerate our momentum. We remain on track to deliver at least 40% of our three-year structural cost savings target by the end of this fiscal year. And I want to thank all of our teams for driving disciplined execution and cost management across the business. Because of their work, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.86. This is at the midpoint of our previously provided guidance and was up 9% sequentially. As we reduce our structural cost, it's enabling sustained investment and innovation aligned with our long-term growth priorities. At SIGGRAPH, we launched our new Z4 Rack workstation for data scientists, content creators and engineers. With the option of our HP Anyware remote computing software, users can access the high performance power of the Z4 from any device. At Computex, we introduced our next-gen HyperX Cloud III gaming headsets, which creates immersive audio experiences for gamers. We unveiled our new Poly Studio video solution for hybrid meeting rooms. It runs on AI-driven software that automatically detects and frames participants to enable a better experience between people in the room and colleagues connecting remotely. And we launched HP SitePrint, an innovative robotic solution that empowers workers to print the most complex construction site layout with pinpoint accuracy while achieving 10 times their productivity. I am even more excited about the progress we are making with our silicon and software partners to co-engineer new platforms that run generative AI at the edge. As I mentioned last quarter, this is a massive opportunity for PC reinvention. Being able to run AI applications locally enables lower latency as well as more robust security and privacy protection. I am very pleased with pipeline of innovation our teams are building, and we view this as a significant driver of PC refresh in 2024 and beyond. We will be unveiling a wide range of new products and services at our first-ever HP Imagine event on October 5. This is a moment for us to showcase innovation across our portfolio, and I invite you all towards the live stream. Last quarter, we also released our annual Sustainable Impact Report. It outlines the progress we have made against our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. We have now reduced our absolute carbon footprint by 18% since 2019. And we achieved our goal to enable better learning outcomes for 100 million people three years ahead of plan. I hope many of you were able to watch our webcast on these topics earlier this month. This work has a positive impact on our communities and helps us to win business. Let me now turn to our business unit performance. Starting at the macro level, we continue to navigate an uneven environment, including FX headwinds. From a customer segment perspective, the picture is somewhat mixed. We are seeing enterprise spending remain cautious, with a rising cost of capital being a notable factor. The SMB segment is showing resilience. And in consumer, we continue to see softness in discretionary spending. Geographically, we see various dynamics playing out in different parts of the world. Most markets are experiencing some weakness, although at different levels. For example, we saw a downturn in the China market, where demand is not even yet back in the lower GDP recovery. Personal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion in the quarter. That's down 11% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Even so, we saw a significant improvement this quarter with PS revenue up 9% sequentially. This reflects back-to-school demand as well as higher unit volume resulting in share gains. Our PS operating margin was strong at 6.6%. Operating profit dollars grew sequentially, driven by higher volume, our disciplined cost management and structural cost reduction. We also gained share in both Commercial and Consumer while still focusing on profitable share. Year-over-year, we gained 2.9 share points while retaining our number one position in Commercial. Gaming saw a significant recovery with double-digit sequential growth. And PS services TCV grew strong double digits sequentially and year-over-year. Turning to Print, revenue was $4.3 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 5% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand, particularly in China as well as aggressive pricing in the consumer print market and delayed enterprise spending in the industrial space. Supplies revenue was broadly flat year-over-year in constant currency, in line with our expectations. We delivered Print operating margin of 18.6%. This reflects our disciplined cost management as well the work we are doing to rebalance overall system profitability. For example, this quarter, about 60% of our shaped units where HP+ enabled or profit upfront big tank printers. And Instant Ink once again grew revenue and new enrollees year-over-year. We also see opportunities to improve our Print performance. We are specifically focused on regaining profitable share and improving our performance in office through stepped-up execution. And given the competitive environment in home printing, we need to improve our cost structure to maintain long-term profitability. Turning to our Industrial business. The graphics and 3D markets continue to be impacted by macro environment and delayed ordering cycles. That said, they remain important parts of our plan to drive long-term growth and value creation, and we continue to innovate to strengthen our position. I also want to acknowledge the continued progress we are making in our workforce services and solutions business. We delivered solid growth in the quarter, both year-over-year and sequentially. And we are building a strong funnel as we spend time introducing our newly integrated portfolio of services with customers. We are very encouraged by the opportunities to grow this business moving forward. Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter, given current market conditions. Our Future Ready plan is on track. We're investing in innovation and making good progress against our long-term growth priorities, and we are doubling down on execution across every facet of our business. This is important as we expect the market to remain challenging in Q4. The macro situation is not improving as quickly as anticipated. And while we expect to deliver another quarter of sequential growth, we are moderating our expectations for Q4 and the full year, consistent with the revised market outlook. This outlook is largely driven by the continued aggressive pricing environment in PCs, sluggish demand in China and enterprise demand [Technical Difficulty]. Notwithstanding the actions we are taking to mitigate these headwinds, we believe it's prudent to lower our outlook based on near-term market reality. Let me be clear. We will use this moment as an opportunity to double down on the things we can control. We have already begun identifying additional opportunities to further reduce our cost structure where we believe we can overdeliver on our cost saving target. This is certainly not the first time we have had to adapt market volatility. It's something we have been doing consistently over the past few years. We know how to manage the business through this situation. And we have a strong track record, taking actions that protect our profitability and free cash flow, which is what you can continue to expect from us. And while we clearly have some additional work to do in the near term, we remain confident in our long-term trajectory. We have consistently said that progress won't always be linear, but we are focused on what we can control and driving disciplined execution to unlock value. We will also continue to execute the capital allocation strategy we have shared previously. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under two times EBITDA. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you in Palo Alto in October for our Securities Analyst Meeting. As many of you know, this was an event we hosted each fall prior to 2020. We hosted it virtually in 2021 and it will be great to be back together in person. We will use the meeting to share more detail on the progress we are making against our Future Ready plan, including some of the opportunities we see to accelerate our digital transformation and structural cost reduction. We will also highlight exciting innovation across the HP portfolio. And we will talk a lot about the significant long-term opportunities we see to deliver long-term sustainable growth and value creation. With that, let me stop here and turn the call over to Marie to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered positive results in Q3 and continued to build on the progress we made during the first half of the year despite the challenging macro environment. We have increased our non-GAAP operating profit and non-GAAP EPS sequentially over the course of the year in line with our outlook. In Q3, our Personal Systems business drove high single-digit sequential revenue growth, which in turn helped drive strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. We successfully completed a debt tender exceeding $1.1 billion late in the quarter that reduced our gross leverage ratio as planned. And our Future Ready transformation plan is on track to achieve at least $560 million in gross annual run rate structural cost savings this year. While there are pockets of our business where we are working to improve our execution, we made good progress during the quarter. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $13.2 billion in the quarter, down 10% nominally and 7% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 8%, EMEA declined 5% and APJ declined 9%, driven by weakened demand in China. Gross margin was 21.4% in the quarter, up 1.7 points year-on-year, primarily due to lower component and logistics costs in Personal Systems and favorable mix, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing across both of our businesses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion or 12.6% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by the Poly acquisition and investments in growth initiatives, partially offset by disciplined cost management, including Future Ready structural cost savings. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.2 billion, down 15.1%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $143 million, down sequentially due to lower short-term financing activity and up year-on-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.17 or 17% to $0.86 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $93 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges and other tax adjustments, offset partially by the debt extinguishment benefit and nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.76. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $8.9 billion, down 11% or 8% in constant currency. Total units were up 3%. Sequentially, revenue was up 9% and total units were up 21% with Commercial up 17% and Consumer up 28%. Improved sequential demand was driven by seasonal strength with back-to-school demand. We also saw continued commercial enterprise softness driven by cautious spending and delayed purchase decisions. We improved our overall market share in calendar Q2 on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, driven by gains in both Commercial and Consumer markets. We continued to see Commercial representing approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter. Our strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Our channel inventory levels are normalizing. However, our estimate is that the industry-wide channel inventory continues to remain elevated. As a consequence, ASP pressures offset volume growth, accounting for year-over-year revenue decline in Personal Systems in the quarter. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 12% and Commercial was down 11%. Increased competitive and promotional pricing drove ASPs lower, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue and higher unit volumes resulting in share gains. We increased our market share in higher-value premium categories, including Commercial Windows and Gaming. Personal Systems delivered almost $600 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.6%. Our margin declined 0.1 points year-over-year, primarily due to increased pricing competition, mix, currency and higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs, structural cost savings and logistics expense. In Print, our results reflect our continued focus on key initiatives as we navigated the challenges of a softer and increasingly competitive print market. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.3 billion, down 7% nominally or 5% in constant currency. The decline was driven by soft demand in both Consumer and Commercial, market share [Technical Difficulty] currency and lower supplies revenue. Hardware revenue was down $256 million, driven by lower volumes, primarily due to China market softness and aggressive pricing competition as our Japanese competitors have leveraged the weaker yen to their advantage. Total hardware units decreased 19%, driven by softer print demand in both home and commercial. Industrial graphics revenue, particularly hardware, remains pressured by persistent soft enterprise demand with the greatest impact seen in Europe. By customer segment, Commercial revenue decreased 6% or 5% in constant currency with units down 8%. Consumer revenue decreased 28% or down 26% in constant currency with units down 20%. ASPs were down year-over-year, driven by the promotional and competitive pricing and currency, offset partially by a favorable mix in both Consumer and Commercial. Supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, declining 2% nominally and roughly flat at constant currency, in line with expectations. The decline was driven by demand softness, particularly in China, lower usage and a lower installed base. This was offset partially by pricing actions earlier in the year and share gains [internally] (ph). Print operating profit was approximately $800 million, down 12% year-on-year, and operating margin was 18.6%. Operating margin decreased 1.2 points, driven by competitive pricing and unfavorable currency, partially offset by structural cost savings and favorable mix. I would also like to note that we recorded accounting adjustments primarily related to a revenue contract in our Personal Systems segment. This has been reflected in our prior quarter compares which I just covered. It was not material to any of our previously filed financial statements and does not impact our current quarter results. We continue to make strong progress on our Future Ready transformation in Q3, and we expect to deliver at least 40% of our three-year gross annual structural run rate savings target of $1.4 billion for FY '23. As I've mentioned previously, we are working on a range of programs, which should enable us to achieve and potentially exceed key milestones for reducing costs across our business. Given the dynamic in Print, we are building the plan to accelerate cost reductions in that business. Let me update you on our progress in Q3. A key pillar of our transformation plan is focused on simplifying our product portfolio, significantly reducing the number of platforms we support to drive agility and operating leverage. We've made great progress in Personal Systems as the actions we've taken have positively impacted our Q3 operating profit rate performance. Specifically, we continue to make great progress standardizing our Personal Systems platforms. At the end of Q3, we were nearly halfway to our goal of reducing our total number of Personal Systems platforms by approximately one-third by the end of FY '24. In addition, we continue to reduce our commodity complexity, decreasing the number of client SKUs in our Personal Systems portfolio. In addition, we continue to look for new opportunities to reduce our cost structure across the organization. In Q3, for example, we optimized our media spend by consolidating our marketing programs and expanding our in-housing model further. We expect marketing will continue to deliver additional savings in headcount productivity and cost optimization as we unlock new digital solutions. We are aggressively pressing forward with our AI agenda to reinvent various functions inside the company to accelerate both our products and productivity. We are enhancing our software coding practices to accelerate code development to improve speed, efficiencies and quality reviews. We are also leveraging our telemetry data to proactively address customer needs and to provide tailored recommendations and solutions to improve their efficiency and productivity. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations was solid at $1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $900 million. The cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days in the quarter. This improved two days year-over-year, primarily due to days of inventory decreasing one day and days payable increasing four days, partially offset by days receivable increasing three days. The sequential growth in Personal Systems has improved the overall cash conversion cycle as expected. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect operational improvements will help drive a sequential increase in free cash flow, including an increase in Personal Systems revenue and an improvement in working capital. In Q3, we returned approximately $216 million to shareholders via cash dividends. In addition, we successfully completed a debt tender during the quarter, retiring greater than $1 billion of debt. Consistent with our outlook, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. Looking forward to Q4, we expect the challenging economic climate and continued demand softness will remain headwinds for our business near term. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY '23. We intend to start managing dilution this quarter as we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy over the long term while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. For Personal Systems, the PC market size for the second half of calendar year '23 is smaller versus prior expectations, driven mainly by demand weakness in China. We expect industry CI levels will normalize by the end of Q4, resulting in improving ASPs as the quarter progresses but by less than initially expected and that enterprise demand will be softer. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q4 to be at the higher end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, driven by sequential revenue growth, lower commodity costs and strong structural and operating cost savings. In Print, we expect overall Print revenue will rebound sequentially due to seasonality. We expect supplies revenue in FY '23 to decline by a low single-digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in Q4. We expect Print enterprise demand softness, including industrial, which will remain under pressure due to elongated sales cycles. We expect Print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for Q4, driven by disciplined pricing in a competitive environment and cost management that will help to offset softened demand. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We are lowering our FY '23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range by $0.11 at the midpoint. The primary factors driving our guidance include our revised outlook for Q4 due to the macro challenges I discussed previously and the effect of the accounting adjustments I referenced earlier, which impacts our H1 '23 non-GAAP EPS by $0.03. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.97 and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.77. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.35, and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.07. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $3 billion for FY '23, in line with the low end of our prior guidance range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Enrique, you've talked a fair bit about looking to optimize your cost structure. Can you just talk about what sort of cost savings are you expecting from these initiatives? And does that suggest that you expect these revenue headwinds that you're seeing right now persist into fiscal '24 as well?
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you for the question. So as we have said before, our goal for the next year is to reduce our structural cost by $1.4 billion and to achieve 40% of those in fiscal year '23. And as Marie said in the prepared remarks, we are on track to deliver on those. And you can see the impact of those in the rates of both businesses, Personal Systems and Print, is probably the best way to see the impact of what we are seeing. I think some of the headwinds, on the second part of your question about the headwinds, we think that most of the headwinds are temporary and that is more a delay on some of the progress that we were starting to see from a pricing perspective, for example. But nevertheless, we -- as we always do, we are going to be looking at accelerating some of the savings that we had in the plan to compensate for them on the short term. In terms of our outlook for fiscal year '24, sorry, I will finish, we have our Investor Day about five weeks from now, and this is when we will be sharing our plans for '24 and kind of the overall view that we have for the company.
Amit Daryanani: That's perfect. I'll wait for the Analyst Day for that one. And I guess, Marie, when I think about free cash flow generation, $1.3 billion, give or take, for the year so far. As you think about what you need in Q4 to hit the $3 billion number, can you just talk about how much of that do you think is working capital improvement versus net income? Because it does seem like a pretty good step-up in Q4 to achieve that. So just the levers that enable you to get that would be helpful. Thank you.
Marie Myers: Sure, no worries. And, good afternoon. So first of all, I'll just start out with sort of unpacking how to think about the free cash flow for Q4. If you take the midpoint of our revised guide, you can see that our net earnings is approximately $3.3 billion. So if you take that $3.3 billion and then you take off the $400 million of expected restructuring charges, that gets you into the $2.9 billion range. And really, the remaining, as you pointed out, Amit, it's really coming from an improvement in CCC. So really, working capital is really one of the key drivers for cash flow in Q4, and that's very much in line with what actually happened in cash flow in Q3.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. As you look at the, I guess, PC and Print business and subscriptions, you've talked about, obviously, subscription ink, you've had a number of different things you're looking at on the Print side. And I know you've talked about it in the future on PCs. I'm just curious, as you're looking at the market, if you're thinking about opportunities going forward, has there been any change in maybe customer buying behavior related to subscriptions? Have you seen any changes in terms of increased churn or maybe lower churn? I'm just wondering how that model is playing through your product line. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Hi, Shannon. Thank you. So no big changes in our thinking. As we have shared, this quarter, we continued to see growth in the number of enrollees, also in the revenue that we get from our subscription program. We have also continued the expansion of our paper program. As we shared a quarter ago, we wanted to expand internationally, and this is what we have done. We are now present in several countries in Europe, and the adoption continues to grow. In terms of churn, no big changes in what we have seen during the last quarter. And then our plan continues to be, as you were outlining, to integrate more and more parts of our portfolio. In the coming months, we will start having the first PC and Print subscription, and we will continue the expansion after that. And important to highlight is going to become, over time, a more important part of our business, mostly because it allows us to deliver a better value proposition to our customers. This is really why not only because of the financial but also because of the return and the NPS is a critical part of our strategy going forward.
Shannon Cross: Thanks. And then I was wondering, just with Poly, maybe if you could provide more sort of insights into what you've seen since the acquisition. I'm curious if there are opportunities. I know AI gets used ad nauseam these days, but in terms of different ways that we might interact with our computers over time, I'm just wondering how you're seeing that asset, both since you acquired it and then going forward to the extent you'll talk about it before the Analyst Day. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you. So a couple of comments. First of all, of course, some of the macro trends that we have seen in the industry and some of the Poly competitors have shared those details. The Poly business has been impacted in the short term by a reduction in the term of some of the major markets. At the same time, the reaction from our partners, customers, as I have shared in the past, has been extremely positive. And as you are saying, there is a lot of opportunity to innovate in that space and to deliver a much better value proposition and a much better experience. We all know how painful some of the video conferences are when you have people in the room, people outside. And we just launched a solution using AI, I'm sorry to use the AI term, where with AI, we can manage or produce almost the video conference, the who will be talking frame, the different people in the room, and we are seeing really much better experience for both people in the room and people outside the room. And when we will have both Innovation Day and our Investor Day, you will be able to see some of these solutions and see the value that they bring.
Shannon Cross: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. You talked about printing and the need to really focus on trying to find incremental cost improvement, and you specifically alluded to that for printing. And I'm wondering if that statement is pointing to the fact that you see something structurally more challenged in printing than you did before? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. Good question, Toni. So as we -- what we have seen in printing is that especially on the home side, we have seen a significant decline of units and it's in the range of 20%. And this clearly will put more pressure on the Print business going forward. It's not a short-term impact. It's really more a medium and long-term impact. And even if in many cases, the units we have lost are low-end units which have relatively low value, clearly, there is going to be more pressure there. And this is why we mentioned that we are going to be accelerating some of the cost reduction activities that we had in the plan, especially focused on home, on consumer, which is where we are seeing this pressure and things like acceleration of the simplification of the portfolio, acceleration of the business model transformation, growing more in what we call [bigging and big donor] (ph) are all the different combinations where we are accelerating our plans. And again, we will discuss this more in detail in a few weeks.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. And then if I could just follow up, it sounds like the demand environment is pretty challenging, and the pricing environment is pretty challenging. And yet the margins that you're experiencing in both businesses and that you're guiding for in Q4 are actually above what your longer-term targets are. And so I was wondering if you could reconcile that. And are those targets too low for printing and for PCs? Or what -- why in the face of pricing pressure and volume pressure are you not seeing margins go down into the range? And what are the trigger points for margins going back down into the range on Print and more in the middle of the range on PCs?
Marie Myers: Hey, Toni. Good afternoon. It's Marie. So why don't I go ahead and comment on the margin ranges for both business and sort of unpack some of the drivers there. But first of all, I'd start out by saying you are seeing some of the benefits that we've spoken about today and in prior calls of the Future Ready transformation. As we've said in the past, we do expect to see those savings flow through both cost of sales and OpEx. And frankly, I think you're seeing the benefits of that in the rate. But obviously, there are some nuances by business. So I'll just unpack it quickly, so to give you that detail. In terms of Personal Systems, we are expecting to see quarter-on-quarter, sequentially, some gradual improvement in pricing as we start to see some of that normalization of CI. So there is a factor of that in the rate as well, combined with the impact of lower commodity costs and then both structural and operating costs that we spoke about earlier. And obviously, that's offset by some of the enterprise softness. With respect to Print, it is a combination of both strategy and execution. We've got the portfolio rebalancing. I think we talked a little bit about that earlier with Shannon, plus honestly, pricing discipline and then the cost management from our transformation. So it's all those factors combined, but you can see there that certainly, cost is a key element. And then I think from a -- in terms of the long term, we're still very confident that for Print, the 16% to 18% is the right long-term rate, and that's because there are a number of different forcing functions there, particularly as you look at the guidance that we've given about supplies in terms of the revenue decline there, the low to mid-single digit and plus a much more competitive sort of pricing in that we've seen in Consumer, and some of that is even evidenced in enterprise more recently. But I think we're overall confident that the rates are the right rates and the right ranges for us for both Personal Systems and Print. And I'll turn it to Enrique if he has anything else to add.
Enrique Lores: Not much to add, Marie. You covered it well. Maybe the last comment is, as we have mentioned before, we don't manage the businesses for the rates. We manage them for operating profit dollars. And this is really what we care the most. We provide ranges because we know it's important for all of you to be able to model, but our goal is to grow operating profit dollars for the company.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess if I can start off with a question more in relation to the moderation of the sequential improvement into 4Q that you're outlining because of the macro. And maybe if you can flesh out how to think about how much of that impact is volume- or unit-driven versus a more promotional environment in the segments than you anticipated at this time. Just trying to get a sense of how much of this relates to sub-seasonal PC volume growth versus maybe just a more promotional environment than you were anticipating. And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yeah, perfect. Thank you. And really, thank you for the question because this was one of the most important things we wanted to clarify in the call. Let me start by saying that the biggest driver of the change of guide we have made is that we are not expecting PC prices to recover sequentially as much as we were expecting one quarter ago. And this is really driven by what do we think is the channel situation at the market level. Because even if we have mostly normalized our channel inventories, our estimate is that the industry continues to have significant channel inventory. And therefore, we will continue -- we need to continue to expect aggressive prices, aggressive promotions through Q4. And this is really what is the major driver behind that. There are other changes that maybe Marie, you want to explain as well?
Marie Myers: Yes, absolutely. So why don't I just give a little bit more context in terms of what Enrique commented on, Samik. I think if you think about the Q4 guide, obviously, the macro is in there and we've talked about that, I think, in our prepared remarks around those headwinds that we've seen, including the sluggish recovery in China. But in addition, just in terms of Personal Systems, it's really -- the way to think about it is the market size and the opportunity. And it's driven by sort of both ASP pressure that we talked about in terms of that CI and then also the softer demand that we've seen in the enterprise. And then finally, there's also some pressure on the Print business just in terms of the enterprise softness, and that's really in industrial where we're seeing today just elongated sales cycles due to that pressure.
Enrique Lores: So let me maybe add two final things. First of all is even if our expectation is that most of these changes are really temporary, we are not standing still, and this is why we mentioned that we are going to be accelerating some of the Future Ready cost reductions to compensate for this. And then to close, I think it's also important to remember that despite of this change, we expect the performance of the company to improve once more sequentially Q4 to Q3, like we have done Q3 to Q2 and as we did Q2 to Q1. I think that's important to have in mind.
Samik Chatterjee: Good. And for my follow-up, if I can just ask, the India market, they have instituted a ban, I think, or proposed a ban since from October 31 on PC imports. How are you thinking about sort of the implementation of that or what are you assuming in your guide relative to that impact? I know it's not a big market overall, but just in terms of what you're assuming and what are you seeing in terms of how to navigate that situation? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So we don't think there is going to be much impact of a potential ban in India in the short term. And in the long term, we had already been working for a while to increase our manufacturing capacity in India. You know in parallel to the ban, they launched also the local production plant, the PLI 2.0 plan. We have applied to participate on that, and we are working with them to ramp our manufacturing capacity there. India is not a huge market but is a very important market for us, where we see a lot of long-term potential, and this is why we are reacting to that. And in fact, maybe just to close, only this week, we announced with Jio the launch of the first cloud PC that we have been working with them for a while, which we think is going to -- is a new category of PCs that are going to help us to really accelerate our growth in that country.
Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Woodring: Great. Thank you for taking my questions this afternoon. Enrique, maybe can you dig into some of the PC channel inventory comments a bit more? Meaning how should we think about the specific regions where channel inventories might be more elevated than others? Are there any regions where channel inventories have normalized? Maybe how to think about that with traditional PCs versus Chromebooks, if there is any difference. And then ultimately, how that does impact your view on the 2023 PC TAM? I think last quarter, you talked about 250 million to 260 million units. How are you guys thinking about it today? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Lots of questions in the question. I'll try to cover everything. Now in terms of channel inventory, we are really pleased with the progress we have made normalizing our inventory. We are almost there, and I say almost because the area where we still have channel inventory is actually what you mentioned about Chromebooks. As you know, Google is going to be increasing the royalty prices in the coming weeks. And therefore, we saw at the very end of the quarter some increased orders and pull-up demand of customers and partners that wanted to take advantage of lower prices. So we ship those, and this is the area where we still have some high inventory. But for the rest, we are now in a good position. In terms of TAM, we have reduced slightly the TAM for fiscal year ’24 -- for 2023. Most of the reduction is coming from the new TAM in China that is really as the market has not grown as much as we were expecting, this has created some impact on the overall TAM. And then we have seen also a slight change between the mix of Consumer and Commercial where Consumer has been performing better and especially because of more sluggish demand on the enterprise side, we have seen the Commercial projection reducing. Thank you.
Erik Woodring: Super. That's helpful. Thank you very much, Enrique. And then maybe just a follow-up, I wanted to get back to some of your comments on PC pricing. Maybe can you just talk about, again, some of those underlying factors in terms of relative to the July quarter, how we should think about the intensity of promotions, mix shift. And ultimately, I interpreted from your comments, we should be thinking about PC ASP growth sequentially just at a lower rate. I just want to make sure that's the takeaway we should be taking away from your comments. Thanks so much.
Enrique Lores: So let me start there. So yes, our current assumption is that price -- ASP for PCs will grow Q3 to Q4, but the growth will be more moderate than we were expecting a quarter ago. And again, the major driver of this is the fact that at the market level, we continue to see -- or our estimate is that channel inventory is higher than what it should be. And therefore, we are going to continue to see pressure from a promotional perspective. There is also an element of mix. Hence, I also mentioned that Consumer in Q3 and we expect in Q4 perform better than expected, and we -- the reverse happen on the Commercial side. And as you know, usually, ASPs for Commercial are better than ASPs for Consumer. Now what I think is important to highlight is our PC business grew from Q3 to Q2. We expect it to grow also from Q4 to Q3. So the recovery of the business is happening.
Erik Woodring: Super. Thanks so much for the extra color.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Thank you. I want to ask about the full year EPS guidance. The midpoint is coming down by $0.11, and I assume most of that is coming out of fiscal Q4. Based on your answer to a previous question, is it fair to assume most of that is coming from lower revenue? How big of an impact is lower margin also a factor? And then, are there other offsets that we should be thinking about?
Enrique Lores: Let me start talking about Q4 and then Marie will talk about the full year. So in Q4, as I said before, the majority of the impact comes from the change in the expectation that we have in PC pricing. We expect it to improve Q3 to Q4 but less than we were expecting before. And this has a significant impact on margin. There are other smaller factors like the size of the market in China, the enterprise performance where we have seen a slowdown of orders driven by industrial print. That also is a segment where we have seen an impact, but the majority of it comes from the price -- the change in price assumptions for PCs. And then Marie, for the full year?
Marie Myers: Yes. So why don't I just walk you through the full year here, Sidney? So basically, as Enrique said, it's -- Q4 is $0.08 and then we had a $0.03 adjustment for an accounting correction in the first half. So really just in terms of just the drivers, I think the right way to unpack it is it's really the PC market size for the second half of calendar '23 that's smaller than expected and the industry CI comments that Enrique talked about. But I think the key is we're going to see those improving ASPs as the quarter progresses but it's less than we initially expected. So if you look at that plus the enterprise demand in PS and Print, that's really what are the drivers of the $0.08 in Q4.
Sidney Ho: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe as a follow-up, last quarter, you guys talked about commodities pricing being a tailwind for you in fiscal Q3, which seems to be the case. But fiscal Q4 could be different. Can you give us an update there? How long do you think those strategic buys that you have done be able to shield you from commodity price increases? Any way you can quantify that, that would be helpful. Thanks.
Marie Myers: Sure. So to give you some context there, Sidney, as you rightly said, we have seen the benefit of commodity costs in Q3 across both businesses, frankly, both Personal Systems and Print. There are some unique ICs in Print that are still somewhat in an inflationary state. But overall, the costs have been favorable for commodities in both businesses. We do expect that, that will carry forward into Q4. So there will be additional commodity cost declines in Q4 sequentially. And in terms of how we're thinking about strategic buys, I would say -- I think I've said this in prior calls, we do feel it's really important to be operationally excellent. But frankly, we're going to take advantage of opportunities that make financial sense. So if there are strategic buys that make -- that fit that profile and that character, we'll absolutely take advantage of them. But I think the overall environment is we're seeing those positive trends. But I'd just add that the favorable trends in CPUs, we're starting to expect to see those to flatten out.
Sidney Ho: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you guys for taking my question. Can I just go back to the margin dynamic, Marie, given all of the moving pieces, particularly around lower, obviously, PC sales, smaller TAM, and sort of the mix, I guess, away from Chromebooks in the fiscal fourth quarter? I guess I'm still going back to Toni's question. I'm still trying to struggle with how, kind of walk through again all the different moving factors on why PSG margins are going to be towards the high end, given a smaller sort of unit base with, obviously, pricing pressure that's leading to maybe a slower uptick in price in the fourth quarter than you had originally expected. And then I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: So why don't I walk you through Q3 first, what happened, and then through Q4, because I think that paints the context on how to think about Q4? So if you look at the Q3 rate, which was 6.6%, it was really a cost story. Whether we talked about just the way we manage costs, the results of sort of the structural costs that we've driven through the Future Ready program. And then I just spoke about with Sidney about the commodity costs. So we saw that cost benefit clearly in Personal Systems in Q3. Much of that is frankly going to be a rinse and repeat into Q4. And there's just a couple of additional sort of drivers in there that help to sort of buffer the rate into the higher end of the range. And that is I think what Enrique clearly articulated was that gradual improvement in pricing that we expect to happen Q3, Q4, and that's really due to the stabilization of the CI level. So that's sort of like an additional factor over and above what we had in Q3. And that's really sort of, I think, the best way to think about the rates, particularly in Personal Systems as you think about Q4. And then obviously, we still got -- underpinning all of that is the enterprise softness that continues to be out there in the market as well. But that's really what's driving it. I hope that provides you some more context.
David Vogt: Okay, okay, thank you. And then on capital allocation, I know you took down some debt in the third quarter. And I think if I heard you correctly, and I jumped on late, I apologize, but it sounds like you're going to restart the buyback in the fourth quarter. I guess from a cadence perspective, does that suggest that you think you'll be under the gross leverage target in fiscal '24 that you have sort of laid out there, that two turns of gross leverage, given the cost initiatives that you talked about in the prior remarks, and we should expect sort of a more consistent capital return going forward? Or could we see another situation where maybe there's a bit of a pause if we hit that gross leverage target or maybe still above it for a little bit?
Marie Myers: Well, I'll just say that sort of our strategy remains the same. We intend to manage our leverage under 2. And I'd say we should also look at it over the longer term and not just sort of quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we're pleased with where we landed Q3 and we're slightly under two times debt to EBITDA. And in terms of then how to think about leverage and share repurchasing, just -- you might have missed the call so let me just clarify. We said in the call that we expect to start to buy back shares to start to manage dilution in Q4. And I think that comment is really important because I'm not sure if you caught the comments on the call, but that's just sort of how we're thinking about it. And obviously, key to us is the commitment we've made around returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. So I'll turn it over to Enrique to probably, I know he's got some thoughts around this as well.
Enrique Lores: Yes. I think two comments. First is our strategy remains the same, so no change, and I think that's important for investors to know. At the same time, the way you asked the question, I think, is the right way to ask it. We are not managing our leverage ratio for one quarter. We need to manage it for the long term. And therefore, we think it's important to restart in a prudent way. We are going to restart by compensating quarterly dilution and this is how we are going to start. And we will solidify our plans for '24 and beyond once we -- and we have conviction that we will be able to maintain the leverage ratio below 2 times, we will accelerate our plans. But we're going to restart prudently, which we think, given the environment where we are, is the right thing to do.
David Vogt: Great. That’s helpful. Thanks for clarification.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Asiya Merchant: Great. Thank you for the opportunity. If you could just unpack a little bit of what's going on, on the supply side. Given that the Print hardware unit, I think even on the inkjet side, on the consumer side are guided down, what gives you some confidence that supplies revenue is, I guess, unchanged here, I think down low digits in constant currency terms? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yeah, I'm happy to. Hi, Asiya. So in terms of supplies, we still do expect to be in the range of low to mid for FY '23. And there's really two primary drivers. One is the usage trends and the second is the share trends. And I would say usage is very much, it's declining in line with what we expected. But what we've seen is that pricing remains resilient. And another important factor is the fact that our inventory in the multi-tiered ecosystem remains in a healthy shape. And just one thing to think about when you do the comps, don't look for the sort of year-on-year because last quarter, we had a relatively easy compare because we had a tough Q4 in '22. So look over the long term, I think that's the right way to think about supplies. I don't know, Enrique, if you've got anything else to add.
Enrique Lores: Maybe add one. One additional comment. I think if we think about supplies, there are multiple drivers of supplies performance. Once clearly the number of units that is being installed, which as I told, I think it was Toni before, this is going to create some pressure as well as we are saying. On the other side, we also have the levels of price, which is something that has been working for us during the last year and especially share. And as we have said before, we have been growing our share of supply during the last quarter. It continued to happen this quarter and this is also a part of our strategy going forward.
Asiya Merchant: Great. And then just on the Japanese competitors, anything -- I think there was some comments made on taking advantage of the yen, I misheard that. But if you could just kind of talk to us about the competitive dynamics in Print and how you guys are kind of thinking about that over the next couple of quarters.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So we have clearly seen an increase of aggressive pricing from some of our Japanese competitors. Of course, if you look at the currency rate between dollar and yen is at one of the lower level it has been in a long time, and this clearly gives them an advantage. Our strategy has not changed. We think we need to continue to sell positive NPV units, units that will not create unprofitable customers. And this is why in some areas of the segments like in the low end, where really are not very attractive around profitable units, we are losing share because this is not a business that we're going to go after. And based on what we see, we don't think this is going to be changing anytime soon. And this is why we also mentioned that we are going to be accelerating our cost actions in Print, both to be more competitive in the short term but especially also to be able to maintain our profitability going forward. Thank you.
Asiya Merchant: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: And I think this was the last question, so let me use this opportunity to close. First of all, I think we delivered a solid quarter in Q3 in a clearly tough environment where we continued to improve our sequential performance while also continuing to invest in the future. And we -- this is really at the core of our Future Ready plan that is enabling to do both, savings that we can use to continue to invest and also to respond to short-term challenges. And then to close, I'm really looking forward to see all of you in person or most of you in person on October 10 here in Palo Alto, where we will be talking about our plan for '24, innovation and long-term plans. So thank you for joining the call and looking forward to see all of you in a few weeks from now. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-30 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2023 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. When we began our fiscal year six months ago, we were clear about two things. We said we would focus on the things we can control to navigate a demand-constrained market in fiscal year '23. And we said we would continue driving progress against our long-term growth priorities. Halfway through the year, this is exactly what we have done. And I am pleased to say the actions we are taking as part of our future-ready plan have started to take hold. Because of this, we delivered non-GAAP EPS towards the high end of our guidance and we have built strong momentum for the second half of the year. Today, I'm going to discuss our Q2 results and the progress against our future ready plan. I will then provide color on our business unit performance and I will close with some insight into how we see the balance of the year before turning the call over to Marie. Starting with our results. Net revenue was $12.9 billion, that's down 22% or 18% in constant currency. As expected, the industry-wide headwinds we described last quarter continued to impact our business. Against this backdrop, our teams did an excellent job controlling our costs, managing our pricing and shifting our mix. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.80. We also grew non-GAAP EPS and operating profit quarter-over-quarter. And we delivered on our year-to-date cost target, keeping us on track to deliver at least 40% of our three-year savings by the end of fiscal year '23. A key part of our strategy is to reinvest savings into innovation. We are doing this in our core business and our key growth areas. We believe this is very important because even though both our core and growth markets are impacted by the current macro environment, we see opportunities to further strengthen our position during this down cycle. Our innovation was on full display at our Amplify Partner Conference in March, where we launched more than 50 new products and solutions. This was our largest channel event of the past four years, attracting more than 1,500 of our top partners from around the world. It has sparked strong energy and momentum across our sales teams and our partners could see the significant progress we are making in our key growth areas. The benefit of our acquisition of Poly was one of our key areas of focus at the conference. Hybrid work is a long-term secular trend that we believe will continue to create attractive growth opportunities. We showed our partners how we are leveraging our combined hybrid system portfolio to create new solutions for customers. A great example is our new Poly video operating system, which uses AI-driven speaker tracking and auto framing to enable better remote collaboration. We also showcased the progress we are making in workforce services and solutions, including the launch of HP Wolf Protect and Trace. This is the world's first digital service capable of remotely locating, locking and erasing a PC, even if it is turned off or offline. And we unveiled new advanced computing solutions through our ZBook line including specific offerings designed for data science, AI and machine learning applications. Let me now give you some more color on what we saw this quarter in each business. Looking first at the market level, global economic uncertainty remains elevated. The macro environment is challenging across most geographies. We continue to see cautious consumer discretionary spending, while enterprises are delaying capital investments. With that as a context, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion. That's down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Like last quarter, we estimate that the sell-out to customers exceeded sell-in to the channel, which means that end-user demand was stronger than revenue shipments. This helped us further reduce our channel inventory. There are still pockets where we need to improve, but we are making good progress as per our plan. Our PS operating margin was 5.4%, in line with our expectations. PS margins remained flat sequentially, reflecting our disciplined mix strategy and cost reductions in a competitive pricing environment. We delivered solid PS services growth with particularly strong performance in digital services. We also continue to improve our execution. Our teams are showing a relentless drive to win in the market. We gained PC share in calendar Q1, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And we are not simply gaining share for the sake of share, we are gaining in more profitable areas such as commercial, where we now have the number one position and gained 2.5 share points year-over-year. We will keep acting with urgency to build on this momentum while improving our results in segments like premium and gaming. And while the broader gaming market is currently challenged, it remains a massive long-term opportunity where we continue to invest. This quarter, we launched a wide range of Omen and Victus gaming innovation incorporating the latest Nvidia RTX graphics technology. We are equally focused on the opportunities generative AI is starting to create for our PS business. We are actively working with our major software and silicon partners to engineer new architectures that will integrate AI applications into everyday use cases. This is a very exciting opportunity. In the same way, the Internet age fundamentally changed the way people use computers, I believe the age of AI will transform the role PCs play in our lives. Turning to Print. Revenue was $4.7 billion, that's down 5% or 2% in constant currency. We continue to see soft demand and aggressive pricing in the consumer print market. This was offset by favorable mix in our office business, including 10% revenue growth in commercial hardware and supplies performed better-than-expected driven by better demand in office. We delivered Print operating margin of 19%. This shows the continued benefit of our disciplined cost management as well as favorable pricing in office as we bring strong innovation to market. For example, this quarter, we launched a new line-up of laser jet printing systems designed to help businesses maximize productivity. We also continue to make progress rebalancing overall system profitability. Our HP+ and big tank printers once again represented more than 50% of our shipments in the quarter. We gained share year-over-year and sequentially in big tank and Instant Ink grew revenue and new enrollees. Just as we have done in Personal Systems, we need to improve our execution in Print to gain share. We aim to do this in a thoughtful way, focused on winning in the right areas to drive profitable growth and increasing our mix of profitable customers. Turning to our Industrial segment. Graphics continued to be impacted by macro headwinds. While flexible packaging and folding cartons are back to growth, this was offset by a decline in leveling. In 3D, the business returned to growth this quarter with good momentum in both plastics and metals. And we recently introduced our new HP Jet Fusion automation solutions, which simplify workflows and reduce cost for high-volume 3D production. Overall, this quarter's results show that we are making progress against our priorities. Yes, we have more work ahead, but we are continually upping our game as we execute our future-ready plan, and our teams are playing to win. We also continued to win the right way. Next month, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report. It will disclose the continued progress we are making towards our climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. As you know, this work is integrated into how we run the company. It has been an important factor of new sales wins for the past several years. And we see this trend continuing across commercial and consumer segments. Going forward, we are taking a more comprehensive approach to measuring the total business impact of our sustainability initiatives. Specifically, we have adopted the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy. This is a well-established industry benchmark to measure what's called sustainable revenue. This measure allows us to quantify revenue generated from products and services that meet leading environmental standards and reduce our environmental impact. Using the Corporate Knights methodology, sustainable revenue represented more than 60% of our total revenue in fiscal year '22. Let me now turn to capital allocation. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach. We are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time and less opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under two times EBITDA. As planned, we did not repurchase any shares in Q2 given where we finished the quarter on our gross leverage ratio. Looking ahead, we continue to expect our second half performance to be stronger than the first half. We see this being driven by improved channel inventory and seasonality, primarily in Personal Systems as well as the positive impact of our cost savings measures. Entering the second half of the year, we believe we have full line of sight to deliver on our structural cost reduction goal for fiscal year '23. We remain focused on optimizing our portfolio. We have talked before about creating a simpler, more focused company. There are many ways to deliver on this, such as reducing our number of SKUs rationalizing our portfolio or trimming our various lines of business. We will continue to approach this work in a way that enables us to best meet customer needs while creating value for our shareholders. We are also capitalizing on infrastructure investment to become a more digital company. This is driving greater speed and efficiency across our operations while enabling new value propositions for customers as we expand our services and subscription offerings. To sum up, we are confident in our future ready plan. We strongly believe we have the right strategy and team in place to deliver on our priorities and drive long-term sustainable growth and our continued execution of our plan will allow us to emerge stronger as the market improves. Let me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid financial results in Q2 against the backdrop of a tough macroeconomic environment. We generated sequential growth in non-GAAP operating profit and margin, non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow. Non-GAAP EPS was at the high end of our guidance range, while free cash flow was better than we expected. We delivered these results by remaining focused on prudently managing costs and optimizing our cost structure further under our future-ready plan. At the same time, we prioritize strategic investments that will help drive future growth when the macro economy recovers. We remain focused on what we can control in the current environment, which enabled us to deliver on our commitments for Q2. Now let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $12.9 billion in the quarter, down 22% nominally and 18% in constant currency driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 21%, EMEA declined 22% and APJ declined 7%. Gross margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 2.5 points year-on-year, primarily due to mix shift to Print and lower commodity costs in Personal Systems, partially offset by currency and competitive pricing, particularly in consumer print. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion or 14% of revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by rigorous cost management, including future-ready structural cost savings and lower variable comp partially offset by the Poly acquisition. In addition, recall last year, we provided aid related to the war in Ukraine. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 22.4%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $172 million, relatively flat sequentially and up year-over-year primarily due to higher interest expense, driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates as well as higher factoring expenses. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.28 or 26% to $0.80 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $269 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges amortization of intangibles and acquisition and divestiture-related charges more than offset by other tax adjustments and non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.07, mostly due to onetime noncash tax benefits related to tax planning. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $8.2 billion, down 29% or 25% in constant currency. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial driven by weaker economic activity as customers in both market segments were more cautious with spending. Despite this, we improved our overall market share in calendar Q1 by 1.3 points year-over-year, driven by gains in the commercial market, where we improved our share by 2.5 points. Improved market share contributed to commercial representing greater than 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter, while constituting about 63% of our PC unit mix. We continue to make solid progress on reducing our channel inventory level sequentially, but levels remain slightly elevated for us and across the industry. As a result, we continue to see aggressive pricing in the quarter. We estimate sellout declined less than sell-in during Q2, which means that end-user demand was stronger than sell-in shipments. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 39% and commercial was down 24%. Lower volumes, FX and increased promotional pricing remained headwinds, partially offset by contributions from hybrid systems revenue. We increased our market share in high-value more profitable segments, including commercial and premium notebooks. Our strategy remains focused on driving profitable share growth. Personal Systems delivered almost $450 million of operating profit with operating margins of 5.4%. Our margin declined 1.5 points year-over-year primarily due to currency increased pricing competition and the higher OpEx due to the Poly acquisition. This was partially offset by lower costs, including commodity costs and structural cost savings and services mix. In Print, our results reflect our focus on key initiatives and improving execution within the context of a softer print market. In Q2, total print revenue was $4.7 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven mostly by lower consumer hardware and lower supplies revenue and currency. Hardware revenue was down about $100 million driven by lower volumes and competitive pricing actions in consumer, partially offset by an increase in commercial hardware revenue. Industrial Graphics revenue declined, reflecting continued demand weakness in the enterprise space. Total hardware units decreased 4%, driven by market share loss and soft home printer demand. By customer segment, commercial revenue increased 5% or 8% in constant currency with units roughly flat. Consumer revenue decreased 19% or down 15% in constant currency with units down 5%. ASPs were mixed. Favorable mix shift towards commercial helped to offset promotional pricing and incremental price reductions in consumer across multiple geographies to remain competitive. Supplies revenue was $3 billion, declining 4% nominally and 3% in constant currency, better than expected. The decline was driven primarily by lower usage as expected as home printing normalizes further a lower installed base and a gradual recovery in commercial. This was partially offset by favorable pricing actions last year and Lunar New Year timing as well as continued market share gains. Print operating profit was approximately $900 million, down 5% year-on-year and operating margin was 19%. Operating margin decreased 0.1 points driven by promotional pricing, higher commodity costs and unfavorable currency, partially offset by cost improvements and pricing actions. The cost improvements were largely due to lower variable comp and transformation plan related savings. Our future-ready transformation continues to build on our strong start through the first half of FY'23 and we remain on track to deliver at least 40% of structural run rate savings of at least $1.4 billion in FY'23. We continue to see significant opportunities to drive further structural construction across our business. Let me update you on our progress in Q2. We further enhanced our digital capabilities, driving additional automation and process improvements. In our Workforce Solutions and Services business, we harvested more proactive data insights from more connected devices with our enhanced diagnostic tools that drove repair cost efficiencies. In our supply chain, we delivered significant improvements in reducing portfolio complexity, improving continuity of supply and increasing our forecast accuracy to facilitate material cost and profit improvements. We saw further opportunities to drive structural cost reductions through headcount reductions and driving efficiencies in our core businesses. In Print, we focused on platform consolidations and road map reductions in our large format business. Looking ahead, we see potentially significant and incremental opportunities to leverage AI and generative AI to positively impact both our products and solutions and how we operate. We are actively exploring opportunities such as expanding our product portfolio to include a new category of high performance PCs, accelerating software development productivity and enhancing the customer service experience to drive higher value offers while optimizing pricing. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was solid at $0.6 billion and free cash flow of $0.5 billion was better than expected. Free cash flow results benefited from better purchasing linearity. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter. This improved four days sequentially, primarily due to days payable increasing 10 days more than offsetting an increase in DOI. While we decreased our inventory by $0.1 billion sequentially in Q2, the upward pressure on days inventory was driven by strategic buys, increased ocean transit mix and a change in business mix. We have more opportunity to improve our core inventory turns and are focused on doing that. But when it is economic to do so, we intend to continue to drive value via strategic buys or more sea transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory. In Q2, we returned approximately $260 million to shareholders via cash dividends. Given where we finished the quarter on our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, we did not repurchase any shares in the quarter consistent with our outlook. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy longer term, but near term, we'll continue to manage our leverage profile prudently and maintain an investment-grade credit rating in the current challenging environment. Looking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY'23, we expect the macro environment will remain challenged and we will remain focused on rationalizing our cost structure further while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We are narrowing our FY'23 non-GAAP EPS outlook range, reflecting greater visibility into the potential range of outcomes for H2 '23. We still expect operating expenses, excluding Poly, will be down year-over-year for FY'23. For Personal Systems, we expect our and the industry's channel inventory will normalize in Q3 and the back half of the year will be seasonally stronger from an end-user demand perspective. We expect Personal Systems margins in Q3 to be in the mid-range of our 5% to 7% long-term target, driven by increased volumes, the continued progress on normalizing CI levels as well as further cost reductions and efficiencies. For FY'23, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing future-ready transformation savings. In Print, we continue to expect suppliers revenue at FY'23 to decline by a low to mid-single digit in constant currency with easier year-on-year compares in the back half of the year. We expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% target range for H2 '23, driven by disciplined pricing and cost management and continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q3 and fiscal year 2023. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.91 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.71. We expect FY'23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50, and FY'23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.91 and $3.11. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY'23. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  And our first questioner today will be Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead
Erik Woodring: Hey, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe Enrique, if I start with you. Just on some of the PC and Personal Systems commentary you made. Can you help us think how you guys are viewing the PC TAM in 2023. Why you have confidence in the back half recovery if you're seeing any signs of end market demand and specifically why you think the second half of the year could be above seasonal? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Erik. So let me start by talking about what we saw during the first half, which really helps to understand our projections for the second half. During the first half, our performance was impacted by the channel reduction that we have been driving. And as I said in my prepared remarks, channel inventory continues to be slightly elevated, but we are almost there. What we saw also was that end-user demand was stronger than shipment, which is what really enabled us to drive these channel inventory reduction. When we think about the second half, usually, second half end-user demand is stronger than in the first half, mostly in the consumer side and driven by things like back-to-school or the holiday season sales. Now when we combine both, the fact that channel inventory will be normalized, which will help from a shipment perspective and also from a pricing perspective and we expect to see more normal demand following seasonality pre-COVID. This makes us believe that the second half will be stronger than the first half as we said during our prepared remarks.
Erik Woodring: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then maybe, Marie, I think you just posted your strongest gross margin and quarterly gross margin ever, I believe. But at the same time, we're seeing declines in PC units, Print units, supplies are declining. They're all declining year-over-year. So maybe one, were there any onetime benefits that you saw in the quarter? But if not, can you maybe help us understand the most important margin factors this quarter by maybe rank ordering. What was the most significant tailwind to margin strength? And maybe help us understand what was the most significant headwind, if you could quantify that, that would be very helpful for us. Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yes. Sure, Erik, and good afternoon. So let me sort of give you a perspective first on PS and then I'll sort of flip to Print. So I mean on the PS side of the house, I'd say, first of all, definitely, we saw the strength in terms of the cost reductions, and we started our future-ready transformation program now a couple of quarters ago. And some of that was offset by demand, et cetera, and increased competitive pricing. But in addition, we actually saw very strong commercial rates as well. So all of that together helped to really contribute to the strong margin performance in PS. And frankly we expect to see that continue into the back half as well. Now as we get to the Print side of the house, I would say, you've seen very robust margins in print, and this is really driven by a few factors, everything from the portfolio, strong pricing discipline. We actually saw a really favorable pricing in the commercial side. And then once again, just like the PS side of the house, we've had the benefits of cost management coming from the future-ready transformation program that's are very much on track, Erik.
Enrique Lores: And let me add a comment because there are always things that we could do better, but we are very pleased with the execution of the teams this quarter, both across Personal Systems and Print and this had a big impact in the results that we have posted.
Erik Woodring: Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thanks, Erik.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I can start on the Print side. You talked about the margin improvement we're seeing there. But I'm just wondering, as you're reporting margins that are above your long-term range, it's hard to imagine that you're still seeing any benefit from supply chain constraints. You've done a lot of sort of -- you've taken a lot of actions around improving the upfront profit recognition subscriptions there. So as we think about these margins, should we think of them as more sustainable going forward relative to sort of how you probably imagine them 12 months ago? Just more curious about you can sustain these margins? And I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Samik, I'd say we're still very much committed to long-term range of 16% to 18%. Obviously, we've seen some of the benefits as you mentioned from supply chain constraints, et cetera. And then as I mentioned earlier, with Erik, we've had the benefits of the portfolio, the pricing discipline, the cost management. I'd just add that as we sort of think around the back half and going forward, we do expect to see some continued pricing normalization. And ultimately, we supplies revenue will continue to decline, as we've said, low to mid-single digits over time. And so for those reasons, we expect that we will stay in that 16% to 18% operating range for the long-term, and it's the right range for the long-term, frankly.
Enrique Lores: And maybe add one comment from my side. We manage the businesses to drive operating profit dollar growth. This is really what we are focused, and this is where our strategies are designed for. We provide margins because we think it will help all of you modeling the business and understanding where the business is going to go, but growth in operating profit dollars is a key priority that we have as we manage the businesses.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, it's more of a clarification and maybe a follow-up to Erik's question partly. When I go back and look at pre-pandemic trends in PS, you've talked about, you've generally done a high single-digit quarter-over-quarter revenue growth in PS in the back half in both the quarters. Are you basically implying that maybe 3Q is a bit below seasonal and then you are above seasonal in 4Q just as you sort of get to all the inventory digestion in 3Q itself? Is that how should we be reading into your guidance? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yes. Maybe I'll take that one. So what we expect is that PS Q3 revenue is expected to be in the high single digits sequentially. So we're getting back to what you typically see from a seasonality perspective. And then Q4, obviously, we'll see greater volumes as Enrique pointed out, because that's our typical holiday season as well. So I think the way to think about it is we're starting to see more the normalized seasonality trends return back.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering if you can comment on OpEx and SG&A sequentially from Q1 to Q2. What the forces that work were there and how we think about the trajectory of operating expense over the course of the year, do you expect most of the savings from your restructuring actions to actually help OpEx? Or will we see that more on the gross margin line? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Marie Myers: Hey, Toni. Good afternoon. Good to hear from you. So maybe I'll start out with the back half of the year first. So we do expect OpEx to be up in the back half. And that's because it's going to be driving both our contribution to some of the growth and investments that we're doing in our growth areas and also in our people. But in terms of where the savings are going, they're going to both cost of sales and OpEx. And as you look at the sequential OpEx, you asked me both sequential and year-on-year. Sequentially, we did see an increase, and that was primarily due to some external funding that we had in R&D that we received in the quarter plus we had some incremental investments and we had some unfavorable currency and bad debt. And obviously that was offset by future-ready savings and expenses. But on year-on-year, you did see a decline, and that was due to expense management, the work we've done around future-ready. And last year, we did have some onetime contributions for aid relief in the Ukraine. So that's how to think about OpEx. And obviously, future-ready, we're pleased with our performance so far and we're looking at new programs as the program continues to mature. But essentially, it's both cost of sales and OpEx and we are on track to achieve the numbers that we talked about earlier.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. If you could just clarify when you say that OpEx will be up in the second half, is that from Q2 levels or in absolute dollars? Is that how you're thinking about? And then just my follow-up is maybe you can provide a bridge from EPS to free cash flow or from net income to free cash flow. So I think your net income is going to be about $3.3 billion at the midpoint of your guide. You have restructuring charges of $400 million. I would imagine if your PC business is continuing to decline, that working capital will actually be a headwind on free cash flow. So how do we get to your free cash flow range if we start from net income? What are the puts and takes, please? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yes. Maybe I'll start on free cash flow and then I'll go back and answer your question on OpEx. So in terms of free cash flow, Toni, let me start out by saying that, obviously, you saw results in the quarter and certainly they're better than expected. But as you know, Enrique commented here a moment ago, the sequential growth in Personal Systems is really driven by that negative cash conversion cycle. And that's a very important factor as we think about the second half. And obviously, this is going to drive a material improvement in CCC in terms of the actual business mix. And as Enrique said, just with the second half, PS will have a substantially stronger Q3 and then ensuing Q4, and that will obviously drive the cash flow as well. And I'll just might add, as I said in the last quarter and I think in the prepared remarks, we're also looking at capacity for strategic buys and shipments. So we're going to make sure that if we may not see a material improvement in inventory just due to that. Now in terms of OpEx itself, we do expect to see an increase in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, Toni, some of that's because we're investing in some of the growth initiatives from our future-ready savings and some of it is the investment we're making in people. But just a reminder that year-on-year, we still expect OpEx to be down. But if you think about the back half of last year, we did take some fairly significant actions. So just keep that in mind when you think about the back half compares as well.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Enrique Lores: Shannon you might be on mute.
Shannon Cross: I was on mute. I am so sorry. Thank you. Thank you so much for taking my questions. I'm curious the AITC commentary. Can you flesh that out a bit in terms of where you see the opportunity, timing? I guess I'm a little concerned that people right now have x amount of IT dollars to spend. And obviously, there's a big sucking sound coming out of all of the AI initiatives. So how do you see your PC offerings fit in? And when do should we expect to see some benefit? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me start by saying that we are really excited about the opportunity that this is going to bring because we really think it's an opportunity to redefine what PCs are redesigned, the value that PC brings and be a big, big driver of refresh, both in the commercial, but also in the consumer space. What we are working on is to build AI capabilities in the PC. So consumers or professionals will be able to run AI applications at the edge and will not have to run them on the cloud. The benefit this will bring is that if you're a small company and you want to use some of your private data, your confidential data to in an AI application, you will not have to upload it, you will be able to run it locally. And also there will be advantages in cost and advantages in latency. What this requires is a new architecture of PCs that combine program, processors with AI processors or GPUs. And this is the work that we are doing with the key silicon providers to make sure that their new designs are integrated into our PCs and into and really help to drive this new value. There's going to be a significant change. Customers will start seeing some of these solutions available in 2024 about 12 months, 20 months from now, and it's going to be a huge opportunity to really bring energy to the category.
Shannon Cross: Okay. That's helpful. And then -- in terms of the printing business, I know there's been talk about moving more to subscription. And you obviously are doing it for ink, but then just start adding in hardware. So I'm wondering, and maybe you can talk about PCs as a service, too. But I'm just curious how we should think about as you consolidate your SKUs. How you're thinking about new -- more recurring revenue business model.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So as we have said before, growing our subscription business is one of the priorities that we have. And over time, we want to offer the majority of our portfolio as a subscription. As you said, we started offering ink, we have extended into toner. We have also -- we are offering now also a paper subscription that really grew -- has been growing very fast during the last quarter. And during this year, we will start introducing the first printers as a subscription and we will start by offering that to customers that will be already in the program. We think this is really important because it enables us to capture more value per customer. We are all -- and we do that because we offer a stronger value proposition. NPS is higher in subscription models, and we really see this as an opportunity to grow and expand our businesses in the future.
Shannon Cross: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Michael Ng: Hey, good afternoon. Thank you very much for the question. It was encouraging to hear about the continued expectation for the normalization of PC channel inventory next quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about whether you expect sell-in to also return to growth as we approach the latter part of the fiscal year? And what do you expect to happen from a pricing perspective, both from an industry perspective and then also for HP? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So let me take that question and maybe Marie wants to complement. So from a channel inventory perspective, we expect it to be normalized in Q3 and exit Q3 we channel at normalized levels. What this will mean is especially in consumer where during the first half, including Q2, there have been significant promotional activity. This will have a positive impact on pricing since those promotions will not be necessary anymore. And as I said before, what we also expect is that end user demand toward customers will really be buying to be stronger in the second half than in the first half following normal seasonality. From a revenue perspective, what this will imply is that second half will grow versus the first half, which will have a significant impact on free cash flow, as Marie was saying before and is one of the key drivers of the free cash flow generation that we expect to see in the second half.
Marie Myers: I think you said it all, Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Michael Ng: Great. Excellent. Thank you very much for that, Enrique. And just as a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could update us on your industry PC selling expectations for this year. And any comments you can make about the new size of the installed base relative to pre-pandemic labels. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. We have not significantly changed the expectations that we have in terms of the selling size of PC market this year. We continue to believe that it will be in the $250 million to $260 million unit range, very similar to what it was in 2019, pre-COVID. We also think that the market is going to grow beyond that. We think that the fact that the installed base is bigger than it used to be, the new applications that we see especially driven by hybrid work that requires better cameras, better audio, better systems are going to be all positive drivers. And in '24 and beyond, we expect to see growth. Specifically, what we expect to see in '24 and '25 is something that we will be -- we are working on that, and we'll be sharing the details during the next quarter.
Michael Ng: Excellent. Thank you for all the thoughts, Enrique. Really appreciate it.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. You mentioned strategic buys a couple of times. I was wondering if you could talk about the component pricing environment for you and where you're specifically thinking about strategic buys and I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Yeah, hey, Wamsi, it's Marie. So look, I think as we said last quarter that basically, look, even though we're focused on driving inventory declines operationally, we said we'd take advantage of strategic buys and frankly, lower the ships where it made economic sense. And so we have continued to do so, and we will continue to do that in the back half of the year. And I think then your second part of your question was around commodities and what the outlook is on commodities. And so I just said for PS, we do expect to see declines sequentially into Q3. Q4, slightly different situation because we expect, as Enrique said earlier, there's going to be a bit of a demand recovery. And plus coupled with some of the comments you're seeing from commodity suppliers that's potentially scaling back on production, that's likely to result in some price increases in the basket of commodities. So that's how we're looking at commodities in terms of the back half of the year.
Enrique Lores: And let me reinforce the comment that Marie just made. Operationally, we are going to be driving HOI down because as we have said before, we increased HOIs during the pandemic. We think we can operate with lower levels of HOI. But at the same time, if we see opportunities to do strategic buys or to increase the amount of product that we send by both, which has lower cost, is something that we will do even if it has implications in terms of HOI because they have both have good financial return to the company and they are both good decisions. So this is something that we manage very carefully, but if we do it, it's because we really see the economic value behind those decisions.
Marie Myers: And I'll just add to Enrique's comments that all of that is reflected in our guide as well too, Wamsi.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks for that. And as a follow-up. Clearly, you mentioned this promotional pricing in PCs. How is the elasticity of demand response to that promotional activity? And as you think about the back half of the fiscal year, is that increase in PC growth largely coming from consumer or commercial? And what kind of impact do you expect on margins? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes. The impact of pricing that I was mentioning before was mostly in consumer, where we saw the need to drive more promotional activities. As we look at the second half, we expect consumer pricing to slightly improve as the situation will normalize from an inventory perspective and we expect to see stability in prices on the commercial side.
Marie Myers: Yes. And I'd say just from a guide perspective, if you look at PS, our Q3 op margin is in the range of 5% to 7%. So it would incorporate what Enrique said and plus just to reiterate that we see very strong commercial margin rates right now, too, as well.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my questions as well. I guess, Enrique, maybe to start with -- it's been a fair bit of talk on PCs, but as you think about the back half performance being better than the first half, can you just touch about -- how do you think about the Print segment stacking up in the back half across both consumer, commercial and supplies. It would be helpful to understand how you think Print ramps up in the back half, given the fact you're talking about a better -- stronger back half versus first half?
Enrique Lores: So let me talk briefly about print. I think for -- during the first -- during Q2, two things to highlight. Clearly, supplies performed better than we were expecting, and this was more driven by stronger demand on the office side. And also, actually, we saw a bigger market in the office space than we were expecting, which is really related to the previous comment. When we project and when we look at the second half, we expect Print to continue to perform at similar levels in terms of operating profit that we have seen in the first half. And some of it will be supported by stronger growth in the office side, really leveraging and being driven by the trend that I just explained.
Marie Myers: And I'll just add with respect to the margin ranges that we also expect to see the continued impact of cost management from our transformation costs as well in terms of supporting the margin outlook.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess, Marie, when I think about the free cash flow cadence, and you sort of touched on this earlier, but you expect a bigger back half recovery about $3 billion of free cash flow I think in H2 roughly on better PCs, as you talked about and a few other things. I guess maybe just talk about do we start to think about as free cash flow improves in the back half and just logically, your net leverage comes down, buyback should resume as well in the back half. Is that the right thing to think about the buyback cadence or is there different things you're going to look at when in terms of deciding when to restart the buyback program?
Marie Myers: No, great question, and thanks for asking. And you're absolutely spot on. We do expect that our leverage should trend down through the back half of the year. And to your point, based on the real strong cash flow that we're going to have, we expect that we will actually have room and actually repurchase shares in Q4. So you're absolutely spot on. Thank you.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead
Robert Mertens: This is Robert Mertens on for Krish. Thank you for taking my question. Just in terms of a quick question back in the channel inventory commentary. I know you've gone through quite a bit, but just in terms of when you would think normalization would happen, is that something during Q3 or something you think could happen exiting the year this year? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Enrique Lores: It will happen during Q3. So we expect to exit Q3 with normalized channel inventory levels.
Robert Mertens: Great. Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of looking at the print business, is there any sort of ramifications for the recent merger with Toshiba, how you think about strategically the Print market as a whole there?
Enrique Lores: No, no changes in our approach. I think what this shows is the need to look for opportunities to find efficiencies, especially given that the Print market, the office side is going to be smaller than what the projections were before COVID. And this is what we have been doing during the last multiple quarters. The significant part of the $1.4 billion of savings that are part of our future-ready plan will help on the Print space and really our focus is on driving growth organically when we announced last quarter that we were creating the Workforce Solutions and Services business, growing our office business, growing our office business contractually is one of the key priorities for the team and we are making good progress there.
Robert Mertens: Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
Enrique Lores: Thank you
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead
David Vogt: Great. Thank you guys for taking my question and I apologize if this was asked. My line had a bit of a problem. So maybe Marie just a bit of clarification. I think you mentioned that PSG margins would be sort of in the middle of the 5% to 7% range in the third quarter. But Enrique also mentioned. You would see relatively stronger growth sequentially because of consumer, which I think has a lower segment margin. So can you kind of talk through how do we bridge the gap from five, four in the second quarter to something notably better in the third quarter? And then I'll just give you my follow-up while I have you. When I think about the second half of the year, I think about normal seasonality, typically, Q4 is up mid to high single digits versus 3Q as you build into your fiscal fourth quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about it because that would imply that the PC units would be down, I guess, again, year-over-year, high single-digits. Is that kind of how we're thinking about the second half of the year? Thanks.
Marie Myers: Yes. So maybe I'll take the second half of the year and then flip to the op margin question. So look, the PS revenues expect to be high single-digits going into Q3. And then think about the back half as being seasonally stronger and lining up more with normal seasonality. So from an op margin perspective, let me quickly go there. So just to clarify, Q3, we expect to be in the mid of the 5% to 7% long-term range, the year in the range. And then as you go to Q3 to Q4, just bear in mind that we're going to have the benefit of commodity cost reductions, cost management, better volumes, impact of future ready and then we're going to have stronger Q4 volumes, much stronger than Q3 and all of that will help to drive the op margin in Q4. So hopefully then that gives you sort of some context that combined with what I mentioned earlier around the strong commercial margin rates as well. So all of that combined will contribute to the strength that we're expecting to see in Q4. And then in terms of just the PS rate being solidly in the long-term range in the year.
David Vogt: Got it. And maybe I can slip one in. So does the buyback -- the high end of the guidance contemplated by the buyback picking up later this year? Is that kind of how we think -- should think about the high end of the full year guide?
Marie Myers: So the high end of the guide, basically, it reflects that -- you saw we took $0.10 off. Originally, we had the high end actually representing the macro. So the high end today just reflects the range of scenarios that we have. And look at as always, it's a prudent guide. If we can do better, we absolutely will. Like I said earlier, I think to, Amit, we do expect we'll have capacity in Q4 based on the strong free cash flow, and that's when we would expect to buy back shares.
David Vogt: Perfect. Thank you. Marie.
Marie Myers: No worries.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. And let me now take an opportunity to close the call. I wanted to, first of all, thank everybody for joining today and also share that we are currently planning for our next Analyst Day event. We will provide more industry information as we close the details of the plan and we will do that as soon as we have that. So thank you, everybody, for joining. Looking forward to talk to all of you soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you to everyone for joining today. Since our Q4 call last November, the macro volatility we described has continued. Our approach remains consistent. We are taking decisive actions to improve our performance while continuing to invest in long-term growth. By doing what we said we would do, we delivered on our Q1 EPS guidance. And we are reaffirming our full year outlook. Today, I'm going to focus my comments on 3 areas: I will begin by summarizing our results and progress against our future ready plan. I will then cover our business unit performance. And I will conclude with our outlook before handing the call to Marie. Starting with our results. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter. That's down 19% nominally and 15% in constant currency. This reflects industry-wide headwinds including corporate budget tightening that has started to impact large enterprise demand. Despite this top line pressure, we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.75. This is in line with our previously provided outlook, and it reflects the actions we are taking on cost as well as disciplined execution on pricing and mix. The future ready plan we shared with you last quarter is already having an impact. As a reminder, the plan has 2 primary objectives. One is to further reduce our cost structure. The second is to continue to assess and optimize our overall portfolio and to develop a required operational capabilities to deliver long-term sustainable growth. We are making clear progress in both areas. In terms of costs, our teams have done an excellent job reducing spend and driving efficiencies. We delivered on our Q1 cost target, and we are on track to deliver at least 40% of our 3-year savings by the end of fiscal year '23. This is allowing us to maintain our investments in long-term growth. Collectively, our key growth businesses grew double digits in Q1, including Poly. We're investing in a down market so we can accelerate our growth when the external environment improves. For example, new hybrid work models are fueling demand for peripherals and other collaboration solutions. We will now refer to this part of our business as hybrid systems. Our hybrid systems business more than doubled year-over-year, and our Poly integration is going very well. The combined HP and Poly portfolio is creating better experiences for customers and building a strong funnel. Hybrid work is a long-term secular trend driving innovation across our portfolio. We introduced more than 25 new products that earn over 50 innovation awards at CES. This included our new Dragonfly pro series, which we co-engineer with AMD. It reflects how we are building deeper partnerships with our silicon partners to co-create better experiences for customers. In addition, we launched our new Poly Voyager wireless earbuds, with 3 mics per earbud they deliver higher quality voice transmission and audio experiences. We are also doubling down on services and subscriptions. There is growing demand for new consumption models that allow us to deliver a better value proposition. And we have created dedicated teams to drive greater focus on these growth opportunities. This supports our strategy to foster lifetime customer relationships and drive recurring revenue. Last year, we created our Workforce Services & Solutions organization. It is providing customers with an integrated set of offerings and expanding our addressable market. We delivered healthy WSS revenue growth in Q1, and we drove margin expansion by shifting more of our mix to digital services and achieving cost efficiencies. We are excited about the opportunities ahead. Our investments in software, security and AI will enable us to develop new solutions. For example, our HP workstations and data science stack is accelerating machine learning and AI workflows, which is leading to the creation of a new category of high-performance PCs specifically designed for data science and AI applications. And we are partnering closely with NVIDIA on new products and platforms for this growing use case. And this quarter, we also created a new organization focused on consumer subscriptions. It's designed to expand upon the success of Instant Ink. Our long-term goal is to ultimately offer the HP portfolio as a subscription. Let me now touch on our business unit performance, starting with Personal Systems. At the market level, we continue to see soft demand in consumer and commercial. We also see pricing pressure given elevated channel inventory across the industry. In addition, corporate budget tightening began to affect large enterprise demand. This is leading to longer sales cycles in our commercial business. Against that backdrop, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion. That's down 24% or 20% in constant currency. Rollout to our customers was higher than selling to the channel with a corresponding reduction in channel inventory. Our estimate is that end-user demand was stronger than revenue shipments. PS operating margin was better than expected at 5.4%, and we grew operating profit sequentially. This reflects our actions on cost and a favorable mix shift improving our performance. We accelerated the growth of our hybrid systems and PS services businesses, and we remain focused on growing profitable share. In calendar Q4, we grew share sequentially in the high-value segments we have prioritized. Our commercial PC share increased by 2.8 points. And our overall PC share grew by 2.5 points as we regained the #1 or #2 position in all regions. Turning to Print. Current market conditions are more stable, and we see different dynamics playing out by business. The consumer print market continues to see demand softness and pricing pressure. In supplies, the situation in Q1 was better than expected and we continue to see strong adoption of profit upfront and subscription models. The commercial print market is being impacted by macro uncertainty corporate budget tightening and the uneven pace of return to office. Within commercial, office printing has seen improvement as the supply situation normalizes. Taking all this into account, our Q1 Print revenue was $4.6 billion. That's down 4.5% or 2% in constant currency. We delivered Print operating margin of 18.9%. Operating profit was flat year-over-year in a very tough market. This shows that our strategy is working. Disciplined cost management and favorable pricing in office had a positive impact. Our office hardware revenue grew 13% year-over-year or 5% sequentially, and we gained share in office quarter-over-quarter in calendar Q4. Although return to office is uneven the pages per device remain in the range of 80% of pre-COVID expected levels. We also continued to rebalance system profitability. HP+ and big tank printers represented 56% of printer shipments in Q1 and we gained share sequentially in big tank. We now offer the industry's broadest lineup of tanks from the low end of the market to the world's first and only laser tank printer. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in Instant Ink surpassing 12 million subscribers. And we drove early adoption of our Instant Ink with paper add on. Industrial graphics and 3D were impacted by macro headwinds, with revenue down year-over-year. We view this as a short-term situation. and we plan to continue investing in these areas to drive long-term growth and value creation. This quarter, we expanded our Jet Fusion lineup and we drove adoption of our metal jet solution with key customers such as John Deere and Schneider Electric. Across our business, sustainable impact remains at the core of our strategy and our leadership on important topics like climate change, human rights and digital equity is building trust in our brand. and it's helping us win new business. It's also driving innovation. Our new all-in-one lineup is a great example. It includes the world's first PC with recycled coffee grounds, which are used in the finish of the device. The enclosure is made with more than 40% post-consumer recycled plastics. The arm stand uses 75% recycled aluminum. And the stand base uses 100% reclaimed polyester. We have also reduced the product's packaging, so we can ship up to 66% more units per pallet. I am proud we were recently named America's Most Responsible Company by Newsweek for the fourth consecutive year. Let me turn to capital allocation. As we said last quarter, we plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, and we are applying the same framework we have used the last few years. We are committed to returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time, unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise. And as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x EBITDA. Given the volatility of the market and our growing contractual business, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we moderated our share repurchase activity in Q1 as planned while maintaining a leverage ratio within our target range. Looking ahead, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal year 2023. We continue to expect our second half performance to improve relative to the first half, driven by our cost-saving measures and as the improved channel inventory levels create a more normalized pricing environment. This is consistent with the view we shared in November. The PC market in units may regress to pre-COVID levels in the short term, but we expect it will remain at a structurally higher level with more premium and high-value mix. As we said last quarter, we expect the overall print market to be down low single digits this year. This is mainly driven by the challenging macro environment and slower-than-expected return to the office. And as I said at the top of the call, we are maintaining our full year financial outlook. To sum up, we are operating in a tough market right now. But we are taking decisive actions as part of our future ready plan to improve our performance, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver. By focusing on what we can control, we believe we are well positioned to navigate near-term volatility. And by maintaining investments in our growth priorities we are strengthening the company for the future. This is what we did in Q1. And it's what you can expect from us moving forward. Let me now hand the call over to Marie for more details.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Enrique said, we continue to focus on what we can control and deliver on the commitments we have made. In Q1, we remain disciplined in rigorously managing our costs and investing strategically while delivering on our outlook. However, our results were impacted by ongoing soft demand. Macroeconomic challenges persisted and corporate budget tightening began to affect large enterprise demand this quarter. We are adapting quickly to the current environment but see continued opportunity to drive further improvement in our cost structure and operational execution. Let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $13.8 billion in the quarter, down 19% nominally and 15% in constant currency, driven by the declines across each of our regions. In constant currency, Americas declined 16%, EMEA declined 15%, and APJ declined 13%. Gross margin was 20.3% in the quarter, up 0.4 points year-on-year, primarily due to improved commodities and favorable print mix, partially offset by competitive pricing, including currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion or 12.5% of revenue. The decrease in operating expenses was driven primarily by lower variable compensation, rigorous cost management and favorable currency impacts, partially offset by the Poly acquisition. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 28.3%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $183 million, up primarily due to higher interest expense driven by an increase in both debt outstanding and interest rates. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased $0.35 or 32% to $0.75, with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $262 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition and divestiture-related charges, debt extinguishment costs and other tax adjustments, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49. Now let's turn to segment performance. Let me start with pointing out that we have changed our revenue reporting presentation for Personal Systems this quarter. We are now reporting revenue by business capability, consumer and commercial versus our previous disclosure by product category, which better aligns with how we think about and manage the business. The composition of our consumer and commercial business capabilities remains consistent with what we have outlined in the past, with the exception of Poly, which is now included in commercial. Also note that Q1 reflects the first full quarter of Poly results. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $9.2 billion, down 24% or 20% in constant currency, with FX headwinds as expected. Total units were down 28% with declines in both consumer and commercial, driven by soft demand and a tough prior year compare. And while commercial constituted about 60% of our units, it represented approximately 70% of our revenue mix for the quarter. We made solid progress on reducing our channel inventory levels sequentially. However, levels remained elevated for us and across the industry. With that, combined with improved supply availability, pricing competition intensified incrementally in the quarter. Our backlog remains consistent with prepandemic levels and still skews favorably towards commercial higher-value units. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 36% and Commercial was down 18%. Lower volumes, FX and increased promotional pricing were again headwinds. Within Commercial, these were partially offset by favorable mix. During calendar Q4, we improved our go-to-market execution and grew our overall market share sequentially. We also increased our market share in high-value, more profitable segments, including commercial, desktops and notebooks. Our focus continues to be on driving profitable share growth, especially in the premium segment of our consumer and commercial markets. Personal Systems delivered almost $500 million of operating profit with operating margins of 5.4%. Our margin declined 2.4 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency headwinds, increased promotional pricing and favorable prior period R&D partner funding. This was partially offset by Poly contributions and lower costs, including variable compensation and commodity costs. In Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and growing our NPV positive units as well as the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 5% nominally or 2% in constant currency. The decline was driven mostly by lower supplies revenue and currency. Hardware revenue was relatively flat, driven by favorable pricing actions in Commercial, partially offset by unfavorable mix and competitive pricing actions. Industrial Graphics and services revenue declined slightly, reflecting emerging demand weakness in the enterprise space. Total hardware units increased 2% as component availability and logistics constraints improved sequentially, augmented by better-than-expected China demand. We continued to make solid progress reducing our backlog and are largely back to our pre-pandemic level. By customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 2% or 5% in constant currency, with units down 8%. Consumer revenue was down 3% or up 1% in constant currency with units up 3%. Consumer printer demand remained soft in the Americas and EMEA regions, driving incremental promotional activity as supply constraints continue to ease. Commercial hardware demand remained tepid due to both the slow and uneven pace at which the return to office progressing and enterprise budget tightening. Supplies revenue was $2.9 billion, declining 7% nominally and 6% in constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by further normalization in home printing and a gradual recovery in Commercial. This was partially offset by favorable pricing actions and continued market share gains in ink and toner. Print operating profit was $870 million, essentially flat year-on-year and operating margin was 18.9%. Operating margin increased 0.8 points driven by pricing actions and cost improvements, partially offset by promotional pricing of favorable currency and higher commodity costs. The cost improvements were largely due to lower variable comp expense management and transformation savings. Now let me turn to our future-ready efforts. We saw strong progress on our plan in Q1 and are on track to deliver at least 40% of our targeted $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '23. In Personal Systems, we are targeting structural savings by streamlining our portfolio to better target customer needs. We are increasing leverage in our product and engineering operations by standardizing on fewer platforms to reduce component complexity. We expect these initiatives to reduce duplication and improve our agility and response time to shifting market needs. We also took actions to optimize costs in our corporate business where we drove significant savings. We continue to optimize and reduce structural costs across our core businesses, particularly in office print and in our supplies, supply chain, including headcount reductions. In addition, we continue to see benefits from our investments to transform our customer support and services organization enhancing our capabilities to provide a more digital enabled customer-centric support experience. We continue digitizing our customer support engagement assets using AI-based interactive voice response technology. We expect this initiative will help automate our processes to deliver a more seamless and connected support experience. Lastly, in January, as part of our future-ready target to reduce employee head count by 4,000 to 6,000, we announced a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. The offer provided eligible employees the opportunity to retire from HP with enhanced benefits. More than 900 participants have opted into the plan with the majority expected to exit during Q2. I continue to be confident in our ability to drive operating cost reductions consistent with our future-ready goals, enabling investments in our key growth areas. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was nominally negative and free cash flow was an outflow of $0.2 billion, in line with our expectations. Our results were impacted by normal seasonality associated with the timing of variable comp payments as well as restructuring charges and lower volumes in Personal Systems. Additionally, our free cash flow was favorably impacted by the timing of receipts and payments related to our factoring program. This is expected to be net neutral to our full year free cash flow. The cash conversion cycle was minus 22 days in the quarter. This increased 7 days sequentially, primarily due to an increase in strategic buys driving up DOI and an unfavorable business mix impacting both DOI and DPO. While we decreased our inventory $0.3 billion sequentially in Q1, we have more work to better align our inventory to our business volumes through operational excellence. We will, however, continue to take advantage of economic opportunities like strategic buys, or more seed transit, both of which would result in carrying more inventory. In Q1, we returned approximately $360 million to shareholders, including $100 million in share repurchases and $259 million in cash dividends. We finished the quarter towards the high end of our target leverage range. Consistent with our disciplined financial management and our strategy to prudently manage our leverage profile and maintain our credit rating in the current challenging environment, we limited our Q1 share repurchases to an amount needed to offset share dilution. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY '23, we expect the macro and demand environment will remain challenged and that our customer end markets will remain competitive. We remain focused on what we can control as we navigate these difficult market conditions. We will continue to rigorously manage costs, streamline operations and improve our performance as the year progresses while continuing to invest in our growth businesses. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '23, we continue to see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in our outlook ranges I will discuss shortly. Consistent with the view we shared in November, we are not expecting a significant economic recovery during fiscal 2023. We will continue to focus on driving structural cost savings and efficiencies in our business consistent with the progress we made in Q1 regarding our future ready transformation strategy. We expect these cost savings will scale into the back half of the year. Given recent weakness in the U.S. dollar, we now expect currency to be about a 3 percentage year-over-year headwind for FY '23. Regarding OI&E expense, we now expect it will be approximately $0.7 billion for FY '23 based on Q1 as a run rate for the year. We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for FY '23, with the second half of FY '23 stronger than the first. As a reminder, our FY '23 free cash flow outlook includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash outflows. Turning to Personal Systems. We now expect the overall PC market unit TAM to decline by a high teens percent in FY '23. Specifically, for Q2, we expect Personal Systems revenue will remain under pressure near term and decline sequentially by a high single digit. We expect revenue to improve over the course of the back half of the year as elevated channel inventory levels are expected to normalize by early fiscal Q3. We expect to continue to drive improved mix shifts toward high value, more profitable units and services and expect this will help partially offset the headwinds we've discussed today. We expect Personal Systems margins to be in the lower half of our 5% to 7% long-term range in Q2 as commodities and logistics costs improve in the quarter. But given elevated industry and HP channel inventory levels, pricing continues to be very competitive. For FY '23, we expect margins to be solidly in our target range driven by the gradual improvement in PC revenue in the back half of the year and increasing future-ready transformation savings. In Print, we expect consumer demand softness will persist and macro uncertainty and corporate budgeting tightening will remain headwinds for commercial. Disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as office gradually improves should help to partially offset these trends. With regard to print supply chain, similar to what we saw in Q1, we expect component shortages will continue to improve but persist into at least Q2 particularly for office hardware, providing continued support for favorable pricing. Regarding supplies, we expect Q2 revenue in constant currency to decline by a high single digit versus our previous expectation to be down closer to double digits. Given its variability, we do not believe inter-quarter growth is indicative of our long-term supplies growth. We continue to expect revenue to decline in FY '23 by low to mid-single digits in constant currency. We now expect print margins to be above the high end of our 16% to 18% range for Q2, driven by continued hardware constraints. We expect FY '23 margins also will be above the high end of our range, driven by disciplined pricing, continued progress on rebalancing our system profitability and rigorous cost management, including future ready transformation savings. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook for Q2 and fiscal year 2023. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.83 and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.50. We expect FY '23 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.60 and FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.62. We continue to make meaningful progress against both our short- and long-term strategic priorities in a demanding environment. I am confident we are taking the right actions and making the right decisions to create long-term value for our shareholders. I'll stop here so we could open the line for your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.
Shannon Cross: Can you talk a bit about what's going on in terms of PCs with regard to end demand? And I think you're not alone in saying that second half of '23 should be better because inventory levels will normalize. But I'm wondering where you're seeing pockets of strength, what you're hearing, how you're thinking about discounting or what features are kind of going to drive an improvement as we get to the second half? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Shannon. Let me take the question. So first of all, something that has not changed this quarter is the weakness that we have seen in the consumer space that we started to talk a couple of quarters ago. Something new, though, has been as we shared in the script, that we have seen weakening demand on the corporate enterprise space as we have seen especially large companies becoming more conscious about how they use their budget being slowly hiring people, and this has had an impact in the PC side. On the positive side, we have seen reductions of inventory especially that one that addresses consumer and SMB business, the more transactional side of the business, which reflects that end-user demand has been stronger than shipments. Our current view is that we will be getting to a normalized channel inventory situation by the end of Q2, early Q3, which means that in the second half, we will not have this headwind, and this is one of the reasons why we are optimistic about the evolution of the PC business during the year. We think that demand will evolve similar to previous seasonality before COVID, and this is one of the reasons why we expect our second half to be stronger than the first half.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then, Marie, can you talk about working capital and how we should think about it as we go through the year? I understand factoring helped receivables this quarter. I don't know if that's sort of an immediate bounce back or a reversal. And then just in general, maybe where you think we can end the year in terms of inventory in that given some of the prebuys versus ability to work through what you have?
Marie Myers: Shannon, so maybe it's a good time for me just to start out first with how I think about inventory and DOI sort of going forward. I mean look, candidly, we need to be good at doing both operationally and excellent actually and driving value where we see opportunities. So as you've seen, we've been very focused on driving up our inventory turns. And when we see economic value, we will pursue strategic buys, right, and look for lower-cost modes of transport. But let me sort of hit up specifically your question around Q1. And what we saw is that inventory turns declined but not necessarily in line with all our business volumes, and that was really largely a result, Shannon, of the strategic buys that we did in the quarter. So we want to remain open to evaluate those economic opportunities, both for strategic buys and frankly, for lower-cost modes of transport throughout the year.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
Erik Woodring: Marie, maybe this one is for you. You obviously just guided the PC market a little weaker than you communicated 3 months ago. I think of that as a headwind to cash just given the strong negative cash conversion cycle. At the same time, as you just alluded to, your inventory is still at relatively elevated levels and 1Q free cash flow was negative with a tailwind from factoring. And so I guess my question is really just what gives you confidence in maintaining the full year free cash flow guide? What is it you see in the data? What are some of the specific factors that you think ultimately get you back or get you into that range for the full year? And then I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: So in terms of how we look at cash for the year, I'd say, first out, our free cash flow for Q1 was absolutely in line with what we expected. And plus, if you look at the earnings outlook that I gave in the guide for the rest of the year. It's absolutely in line with what we guided last quarter. So really, it is the combination of both that give me confidence in our guide of 3% to 3.5% for the year. A couple of other points of note to pivot off what Enrique said early about seasonality. Now we do expect cash flow to sort of  line up with the seasonality comments that Enrique made earlier. So we expect it to be better and materially stronger in the second half of the year. With that said we do expect cash flow in Q2, therefore, to be roughly in line with Q1. And just remember, in the second half of the year, PS revenue will grow on the top line. And as you know, that PS contributes cash when it grows sequentially because of its negative cash conversion cycle. Another source of cash just to hit on it. I know Shannon brought up that point a moment ago, another sort is obviously continued inventory reductions. And actually this quarter, we did reduce inventory. So both of those, I think, are just really good examples of how we think about cash flow for the year.
Erik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe my second question is just on print operating margins. Another really strong quarter. That's 5 consecutive quarters above your 16% to 18% target range. Do you expect to be above that range for the full year? So are we entering a new paradigm maybe where print operating margins are going to be above that long-term range? Or are there other factors that you expected to become offset such that longer term, we should think about print operating margins more within that 16% range?
Marie Myers: Yes. Erik, maybe I'll take a shot at that one. So as we've guided, we do expect print margins to be above the high end of the range going forward, at least for '23. And really, it's a tale of what you saw in Q1. The Print margins are really driven by, I think, our strategy working. And you see that, I think, in a couple of dimensions, both in terms of rebalancing the profitability between hardware and supplies, also just shifting the business into HP+, big tanks. In fact, if you look at the last quarter, more than 50% -- 56% of the units shipped were in that HP+ and big tank. The other point to note is just execution. I think if you look at what we did in this last quarter, it's a really good example of where you're seeing the actions both around future-ready cost cutting, expense management are all showing up, combined with resilient pricing. All those factors are contributing to the robust margins. So what we saw in Q1, Erik, is really what we expect to see for the rest of the year in Print.
Enrique Lores: Let me add that we are pleased both with the strategic progress we have made at executing the strategies that we defined 3 years ago but also taking advantage and getting the benefit from all the work on cost that we did during the last 3 years and that we are continuing to do now.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Really appreciate it. I may have missed it Enrique and Marie, but did you mention of the growth business category what percentage of revenue those are now? And what's the growth profile was for the quarter? And then I have a follow-up as well.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me -- thank you for the question because this is something that we wanted to clarify. We mentioned briefly on the script, but we wanted to provide more details. So during this quarter, we have made some changes in the definition of the growth categories because we wanted to align better how we talk about them externally to some of the internal changes we have made. By growth categories, we really are referring to the 6 businesses that we think are going to be growing faster than the core business and that we're going to have accretive margins compared to core. Something common, they have a common strategic intent, which is really to create more value for our customers by focusing on the long-term relationship with those customers. And this is behind the expansion into services, subscriptions and many of these businesses. During the last quarter, we made 2 internal changes: one is we created a focused organization to [indiscernible]    after Workforce Solutions and Services. And we defined the goal of that team to drive and to grow service-driven opportunities. We also have just created a consumers subscriptions team that will be driving that opportunity across the company starting from the work that we have done on Instant Ink and expanding now and during the next quarter to the rest of HP portfolio. And we also decided to align the HyperX business with our gaming PC team. So we have one group that is really responsible for the full experience for gamers. As we went through all these changes, we realign also how we externally will be reporting those especially in the Workforce Solutions & Services, since we are really focused now on service-enabled businesses.
Ananda Baruah: And Enrique -- I'll keep it here Enrique. Is that to say that you'll no longer be providing us a sense of kind of the old grouping, what the percentage of revenue is and what the growth rates of that old grouping was? And then I have just a quick clarification after that, too.
Enrique Lores: No, we will continue to do that. I was just highlighting the changes because, for example, as we have done that, the overall size of Workforce Solutions is going to be smaller than what it was because we have redesigned, redefined the business. This is what I was highlighting. Every quarter, we will provide visibility as we have done over the last quarter of the growth of the different businesses, you see that on the deck. And every year, we will be reporting the total size as we have done in the past, Ananda.
Marie Myers: And they did grow double digit collectively in the quarter as well and other just to answer part of your question.
Ananda Baruah: And then my quick follow-up is, Enrique, you mentioned in the prepared remarks and you just mentioned a moment ago, shifting the HP portfolio towards subscription. Is that to say the entirety of the HP portfolio, you guys have an eye on moving towards the subscription model? I just want to make sure I understand the context of those remarks.
Enrique Lores: So this is something that we shared already in our Investor Day a couple of years ago, so it's not new. But we see an opportunity to better serve our customers by expanding our subscription business from supplies to eventually other parts of the portfolio, our long-term direction is to enable a large part of the HP portfolio, but this is a journey that is going to take multiple quarters. You will see us making progress in the next quarters. We are now included paper. We will be including some of our PCs and printers in the coming quarters. And over time, we will continue to expand the offering.
Operator: We'll take our next question from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt: Maybe just a question for both Enrique and Marie. When I think about your comments about how the TAM develops in fiscal '23, if I extrapolate what you've done in the past pre-COVID it would suggest that by, let's say, by fiscal Q4, your PC segment could be basically flat on a year-over-year basis. Is that the right way to think about the business as it sort of plays out over the next couple of quarters? And then I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Yes. Maybe I can sort of talk to just the PC outlook and how to think about the guide. So obviously, a big part of this is, I think what Enrique said earlier around the channel inventory. We do expect that, that channel inventory will get cleaned up through the course of Q2 and then into Q3. And I think Enrique mentioned that some of that pressure that we're seeing in the corporate enterprise space. And I think this is largely in line with what the industry is assuming. So at this point, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, we're not expecting any type of macro recovery. But if you sort of group all this together, what we're expecting is we're going to see better PS revenue in the back half as that channel sort of corrects and cleans up.
David Vogt: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up. If I think about the profitability of PC for the full year, and I kind of extrapolate your comments on revenue in the back half. that would suggest that in the second half of the year, just round numbers, quarterly profitability per quarter is going to have to be north of $0.90 per share. You're basically flattish with last year. Do you expect -- is that the kind of -- if I just kind of take the midpoint of your full year guide, is that the kind of leverage you would expect to get as the cost cuts start to flow in more in the July and October quarter from sort of where we are in the April quarter?
Marie Myers: Yes. So that ties very much to the comments I made earlier around the channel but also just combined with the fact that we do expect, I think I said in my prepared remarks, to see ourselves in the lower half of the range in Q2 as we go through that channel correction. Then as we get into the back half, we're going to see the margin rates lift back up to be fully in the range. And so it's a combination of the channel plus we've got the impact of our future-ready efforts. We've already seen some of that impact play out here in Q1. We expect those actions to continue to take a stronger hold throughout the year. So expect to see some of that in the rates as well. And then I would add another factor which did help and contribute actually to the margin in Q1, and that was the mix inside the PS business. So remember, we have now a full quarter of Poly in our numbers and that overall mix shift is also a driver and contributing to the overall margin structure as well.
Enrique Lores: Yes. Maybe let me add a comment on TAM that I think will help to understand these numbers from Marie. As you were saying from a unit perspective, we expect the TAM of the year to be flattish compared to what it was in 2019, but we expect it to be higher from a revenue perspective because of the change of mix that Marie was explaining. So from a revenue perspective, this has an impact on total TAM, and it will also have an impact on our performance.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have 2 as well. Perhaps you can just give us an update on how much progress and savings were realized in Q1 and specifically, it looks like SG&A went up considerably sequentially, even though revenues were down. And I thought you had 2 months of Poly last quarter, so there's some incremental Poly, but maybe you can just reconcile what happened with SG&A on a sequential basis? And then how much of the progress towards 40% of the savings do you feel you captured in Q1? And I have a follow-up, please.
Marie Myers: It's Marie. So maybe I will just hit up quickly SG&A, what drove that increase sequentially. So primarily, Toni, that was due to the increase in incentive comp and stock comp. So you might recall that Q1 is a normal quarter for our annual equity grants for employees. So that's what you've seen there relative to what drove that increase. And then with respect to the transformation savings, I would say that we're off to a very strong start. And in fact, these savings contributed to the overall results in the quarter. And you saw that obviously in the evidence and the strength of the margins in both PS and print. And I would say, look, we are absolutely confident we're on track for the plan for the year. And we're continuing to work that funnel put more into the funnel. So at this point in time, I'd say we're absolutely committed to delivering at least that $560 million of gross structural run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year.
Enrique Lores: And we -- and Toni, we have work going across all the areas that we described last quarter from portfolio simplification, removing some elements of the portfolio, simplifying them making our processes more efficient using some digital tools, looking for efficiencies across the board. So I think we have a full program across the company driving that, and we are making very good progress.
Marie Myers: And just to reiterate, Toni, they're in both cost of sales and OpEx. Just so [indiscernible]
Toni Sacconaghi: Right. And if I could follow up just on cash flow. So if I think just really high level, midpoint of your guidance sort of points to about $3.3 billion in net income. You have $400 million in restructuring costs that would take you down to $2.9 million, adjusting just for that. And then you have a negative mix shift in terms of PCs growing slower than the overall company in all likelihood per your guidance. So that would also hurt free cash flow. So if I just look at those 3 structural things, you're actually looking below $3 billion. So are you -- what's the bridge to get to above $3 billion? Are you counting on meaningful working capital improvements? Because you did condition that you still might do strategic guides or there may be other reasons why perhaps you may not be able to bring down inventory. So perhaps starting with my bridge, you can tell me what's missing and how we can get comfortable with $3 billion to $3.5 billion?
Marie Myers: Sure, Toni. So I think just to reiterate what I did say earlier that both the Q1 numbers and the earnings guide that we gave last quarter, we're absolutely committed to those yet again. I think that's just another point to note. But to build off your bridge, so one additional point that you pointed out just around working capital. So we did actually reduce our owned inventory in the quarter from -- by about $300 million. We do intend to continue to have reductions of owned inventory throughout the year. So obviously, we'll be managing those, pending any economic opportunities for strategic buys, as I said earlier. The other important point to think about is the -- we talked about -- a bit about this during the call, it's just that second half improvement that we're expecting in Personal Systems revenue. As you know, PS contributes cash when it grows sequentially, and that's because it has that negative cash conversion cycle. So there are just 2 incremental points to help you sort of model out the cash flow for the year.
Enrique Lores: And then just one clarification. The improvement in inventory that Marie mentioned is net of the strategic buys that we already did this quarter. So we already did some in Q1.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: My first question is on the print side. It does look like the supply is a little better than you expected and you also slightly upticked the guidance for Q2. Just curious what the dynamics that you're seeing there? And do you think the overall business for Print has reached a bottom in Q1, considering supplies are starting to improve and commercial constraints are starting to ease as well. And then I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Yes. So maybe I'll just answer your question on supply. So yes, you're right. We did actually see supplies perform better in Q1 and our guidance that -- I think the guidance we gave in our prepared remarks is that we expect it to decline by only high single digits in Q2. As we sort of think about the year, we do expect supplies revenue growth to be back to what we said at our Analyst Day so back in that sort of low to mid-single digit. Some of the sort of drivers of that, firstly, are really the strength that we're seeing around consumer usage and share trends. Plus I think I commented earlier, just around the pricing resiliency that we're seeing in print and specifically in supplies. And then finally, I'll just add because I know many of you asked this question, is just around the channel imagery. And if you look across our entire sort of multitiered ecosystem, supplies channel inventory is in very good shape.
Enrique Lores: And let me add one comment. And we have said that when results were below the expectations we had. And I will say now it also when we are above, looking at quarter-on-quarter comparison 1 year, is really not the best way to look at the health of the business. This is why Marie was saying, we continue to -- we maintain the guide that we had for the year for supplies. Year-on-year comparisons are much better. Small changes 1 quarter could have a big impact on the quarter-on-quarter compared so easily not the right way to look at the health of the business.
Sidney Ho: Great. That's helpful. A quick follow-up here is that if I look at the full year EPS guide being unchanged, obviously, but there is a lot of different moving parts. Partly, on the goods on the positive side, you've got foreign exchange being better, margins seems to be better. it sounds like on the negative side, there's some PC demand weaker than you expected. Just maybe if you can help us bridge the various components that get you back to the original guidance, that would be helpful.
Marie Myers: Yes. Look, maybe I'll start out and say, look, the outlook, as you know, we've got a pretty broad range there. So it does contemplate multiple scenarios. And obviously, it's prudent. And as always, I think you see that from us. If we can do better, we absolutely will. So -- but a couple of drivers there. I'll just walk you through to kind of get you through the puts and takes on the guide. First and foremost, we've talked a bit about our cost actions today for future ready. We do expect that they're going to continue to yield quite positive results in the back half of the year. And as I said earlier with Toni, we're working that funnel to pull even more savings into FY '23. So that will be a contributor. We've talked about channel luminary contribution in terms of Personal Systems. Plus, we did get a chance to hit on today, just the continued improvement in supply chain. I think that's a very important point we didn't get much time to talk about. And then finally, just remember, at the midpoint, we don't expect a macro, but we're working multiple scenarios. So that's why we've got the range that we have on the guide this time.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Lauren Lucas: This is Lauren on for Amit. I just wanted to double-click into your views on the PC TAM beyond 2023. What kind of gives you the confidence in a structurally larger PC TAM versus some of the comments that IDC has made and some of the revisions they've made to their long-term forecast?
Enrique Lores: I think there are 2 big positive trends that I think is worth to highlight. Today, the installed base is significantly higher than what it was before. And therefore, at some point, these PCs need to be refreshed. So this gives us a positive tailwind for the business. Second, from a revenue perspective, as I said before, the way PCs are used today, the applications that are being used for drive better mix require -- require better configurations. And when we put both of them together, this gives us the opportunity of them to be bigger. Additional to that, we see the adjacencies around PCs like the hybrid opportunity in video conferencing systems, cameras that -- and we believe the hybrid work is here to stay. That's another incremental opportunity versus what we saw in 2019. And the shift to services, whether it's contractual services for businesses or subscriptions for consumers also gives us an opportunity of growing the business and growing the TAM.
Operator: We'll take our next question from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Congratulations on the results and outlook. It's very impressive considered the macro outlook. Question, Enrique, I'm -- me and my family are a subscription on Instant Ink, and we love it. Your comments about shifting to subscriptions. Was that for all options of your various projects? Or was it you actually think the future sales actually strategically as you think everyone will probably be doing subscriptions only? The reason why I ask is I just think there might be kind of the view of potentially both of them helping out. But I just kind of wanted to see, I mean you said subscriptions for everything. How far down you're kind of thinking about for every single transaction sale? Or is it more of options based upon your clientele?
Enrique Lores: It will be more options depending on the clientele. We know that there are customers that will be willing to buy subscriptions and others that prefer not to. And of course, we will be offering both. But since you are a customer already of Instant Ink, let me do a small commercial, you should enroll now to the paper program because now you can get not only ink, but you can get only paper, which is an addition to the program. And over time, you will be able to buy the next printer and other type of services from us. So this is part of the road map that we have of expanding the portfolio of subscriptions that we shared in the past and that now is starting to become real.
Jim Suva: Well, Enrique, you never know, you can keep an eye on my account. And then a question for Marie. Can you talk about your capital allocation plans? Because now Poly is integrated, it's a full year into your books. How should we be thinking about stock buyback, debt levels, investment, cash levels, where you feel comfortable in uses of capital?
Marie Myers: Yes, no worries. I'd say nothing's changed. We continue to make the same capital allocation approach that we've used for the last sort of 3 years or so. But I would say one point, which I think you hit on there, would is that we are very focused on keeping our gross leverage under 2. And you would have seen in the quarter that we actually bought back only 100 million shares. So consistent with maintaining our leverage ratio, we don't anticipate buying back shares in Q2, but we do expect that we'll have room for share repurchases in the back half of the year. So I'd just like to kind of close and say, look, we're committed to staying within our target leverage range. For us, maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade credit rating is just critical to our business, Jim. I don't know, Enrique, if you have anything you want to add.
Enrique Lores: Yes. I would like to add like as our leverage ratio will allow us, we continue to believe that buying back shares is a great way to return value to our shareholders, and this is something that we plan to continue to do as we have done in the last years. And I think with that, this was the last question. So thank you, everybody, for joining. Thank you for spending time with us today. And maybe let me confirm some of the key messages that we have driven today. First of all, that even in a challenging environment, we have delivered on the commitments that we made a quarter ago based on the progress we have made in the areas that we can control whether it's costs, price, mix, growing share in profitable categories. We know that this is how we can manage where we need to focus and what we have been doing during the last quarter. And at the same time, we have maintained investment in the growth areas because we think that our goal continues to be to position HP in a strong way for whenever the economic recovery will happen. Thank you again for joining us today and looking forward to talk again in a quarter. Thank you.
Operator: And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-22 17:00:00) =====

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I'm going to focus my remarks on three key topics: First, I will recap our Q4 and full year results. Then I will discuss actions we are taking to position our business for the future, including a new three-year plan focused on structural cost reductions that will drive the next phase of our digital transformation and the investment in our growth businesses. And I will close by talking about our outlook for 2023. But let me start by setting some important context. It has now been three years since I became CEO. From the day I took over, my top priority has been to deliver long-term, sustainable, profitable growth while transforming our business for the future, and we have made important progress. We started by launching an aggressive plan to unlock value. We implemented a new global operating model that brought us closer to customers and helped us significantly reduce structural costs. We initiated actions to rebalance profitability in our Print business. And we began to diversify our portfolio to capture more value per customer. We expanded into adjacent growth categories such as peripherals. We extended our services and solutions offering, and we shifted more of our business to subscription and contractual models. These changes helped us to improve our operational performance. They also position us well for the disruption caused by the pandemic, which we were able to use as a catalyst to accelerate our transformation. And our track record over these past few years provides a window into what you can expect from us moving forward. We have proven to be resilient in the face of changing market conditions. We delivered strong free cash flow, controlled our costs and scaled our growth businesses. At the same time, we will continue challenging ourselves to do better regardless of the external environment, and there are areas where we need to do better. When we see things that aren't working, we will fix them, and we will embrace every opportunity to improve our performance because our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders deserve nothing less. You can expect us to take the same approach in 2023 and beyond.  Let me now turn to our results for the quarter. Revenue was $14.8 billion, down 11% nominally or 8% in constant currency. This reflects macro headwinds in the market and is very consistent with what we described last quarter. We continue to focus on what we can control. We managed our pricing mix and cost to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $0.85, which is towards the high end of our previously provided outlook. And we delivered strong free cash flow of $1.8 billion, while returning $1 billion to shareholders. Very importantly, we also maintained our momentum in our growth portfolio. In short, we did what we said we were going to do last quarter.  Turning to our Q4 business unit performance. Personal Systems revenue were $10.3 billion. That's down 9% in constant currency year-over-year, but up 2% sequentially or 4% in constant currency, including two months of Poly's results. The Poly integration is going well so far with the business performing better than expected. We continue to receive very positive feedback from the market about the opportunity ahead. We are well positioned to accelerate our peripheral growth, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP operating profit and EPS in fiscal year '23. Our PS operating margin was 4.5% in the quarter, below our long-term target range due to increased competitive pricing, particularly in EMEA. Still, we remain confident in the long-term trajectory of PS as we navigate near-term volatility in the market. The PS TAM remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we are making progress against our long-term strategic priorities. This includes shifting more of our mix to high-value segments. In Q4, our Commercial business continues to account for more than 2/3 of our overall PS revenue. However, we are not satisfied with our PS market share results this quarter. We know we can do better, and we will. We see many opportunities to improve our execution and gain share in key segments of the market.  In Print, revenue was $4.5 billion. That's down 7% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency, largely due to continued softness in the Consumer market, both hardware and supplies and supply constraints. That said, our operating margin of 19.9% was well above our target range, reflecting disciplined cost management and pricing. Our Commercial business made a good recovery during the quarter, with office hardware revenue growing double digits year-over-year and sequentially. This was offset by declines in home and supplies, both of which were in line with our expectations. We also made progress against our plan to rebalance system profitability and further reduce our reliance on transactional supplies. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing about 55% of our printer shipments. And we had another good quarter in Industrial Graphics and 3D, both of which grew revenue year-over-year and sequentially. Now turning to the full year. Our Q4 results capped off a solid 2022 in the face of tough market conditions in the second half. Fiscal year '22 revenue was $63 billion. That's down 1% nominally and up 1% in constant currency. We exceeded our full year revenue target for our key growth businesses, each of which delivered double-digit organic growth. Collectively, they generated more than $11 billion in revenue. That's $1 billion above our target and reflects the strong momentum we are building. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $4.08. That's up 8% year-over-year and within our target range. We generated free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we returned $5.3 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We also continued to advance our sustainable impact agenda. This is a key differentiator for our brand, and I am proud of the work our teams are doing to make it a competitive advantage. This year, we were the only technology company globally to receive an A rating from CDP, one of the world's leading NGOs dedicated to environmental sustainability reporting. And almost all the new printers, laptops, notebooks, displays and workstations we launched in 2022 included recycled materials. Sustainable impact will remain a key strategic priority moving forward. Fiscal year '22 also marked the completion of our three-year value creation plan, and we exceeded all the key targets we set. In addition to delivering on our financial commitments, the plan drove important investments in our future. Most notably, we invested in our digital infrastructure to begin replatform in the company. And we invested in both R&D and M&A to accelerate the growth of our businesses. These investments have strengthened our resilience and positioned as well for the volatile market ahead. I now want to talk about what comes next because while we have delivered on our value plan, we are not done, and we have initiated the next phase of our transformation. Our ultimate goal is to create a Future Ready HP. Future Ready is our strategic framework that we are driving across the company. It has two primary objectives. One is to develop the portfolio and operational capabilities needed to drive sustainable growth. The other is to further reduce our cost. Marie will talk more about the cost side of this transformation. Today, I am going to walk you through three key elements of our Future Ready plan, digital transformation, portfolio optimization and operational efficiency. They are also the major drivers of savings of the plan we are announcing today. I will start with digital transformation. We are continuing the process of digitizing the company. We plan to capitalize on the infrastructure investments we made over the past three years to simplify and accelerate many processes through automation and end-to-end management. For example, we are launching end-to-end initiatives that will enable faster conversion from lead generation to free cash flow. Our digital transformation will also drive productivity, speed and quality of our execution across supply chain, customer support and go-to-market. In addition, our new digital backbone will enable us to scale key growth businesses by delivering new customer value propositions such as personalized services and solutions that allow us to capture more value per customer.  The second area of focus is on optimizing our portfolio. In the current environment, I believe it's essential that we zero-in on businesses where we can drive significant competitive advantage and market leadership. We have an opportunity to create a more focused and more growth-oriented line of businesses based on innovation that meets the changing needs of our customers. We also have opportunities to simplify our portfolio. For example, in Personal Systems, there is an opportunity to significantly reduce our number of unique SKUs. And we plan to significantly reduce complexity and cost in businesses where we don't expect to achieve growth but can drive value. A significant portion of the savings we generate is expected to be invested to drive innovation in our key growth businesses to increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll give you some examples. In hybrid work solutions, we intend to leverage the combined strength of Poly and HP to drive attach, while expanding in software and services to deliver differentiated hybrid work solutions for meeting rooms and home offices. In gaming, we see significant opportunity to drive better collective experiences through both software and hardware. And we will create seamless experiences across PCs, displays and peripherals. Through our newly informed workforce services and solutions business, we will simplify IT management for customers through new Device-As-A-Service offering tailored for hybrid ecosystem. We will also expand our consumer services offerings beyond Instant Ink to include new areas such as paper and print hardware. In Industrial Graphics, we will continue to lead the industry in innovation that drives that analog-to-digital transformation. And in 3D, we will continue to invest in our own 3D end-to-end printing applications and in our metals portfolio. And we expect these businesses collectively to continue growing organically double digits next year. The third area of focus I'm going to cover today is delivering operational excellence. We plan to continue to optimize our performance by driving efficiencies, simplifying organizational structure and removing unnecessary costs. This work will build on our previous transformation initiatives to unlock new structural savings. We will be taking actions across the company to reduce our variable spend and structural costs. For example, in our Print business, we will further reduce our core fixed cost structure and align it to post-pandemic market sizing. And our consumer subscription offerings will allow us to be more efficient in simplifying our portfolio. The cost actions of our Future Ready plan will generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural savings by year-end fiscal year '25. They will allow us to mitigate near-term market headwinds, mitigate softness in the core businesses; and just as importantly, to maintain investments in long-term growth. As part of the actions we are taking, we will be reducing the size of our workforce over the next three years. We expect to reduce it by 4,000 to 6,000 people. These are the toughest decisions we have to make because they impact colleagues we care deeply about. We are committed to treating people with care and respect, including financial and career services support to help them find their next opportunity. But while these are difficult decisions, we are doing what's best for our business.  Let me now provide some color on our outlook for the year ahead. We expect to operate in a challenging macro environment during fiscal year '23. In our guide, we are not assuming a significant economic recovery over the next 12 months. We expect our second half performance to improve, mostly driven by the cost-saving measures we are implementing. We plan to maintain our current capital allocation approach, applying the same framework we have used during the last three years. We plan to continue to return at least 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders over time unless opportunities with a better return on investment arise and as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x. Given the volatility of the market, we believe it's important to maintain a healthy balance sheet through prudent financial management. Therefore, we will temporarily reduce our share repurchase activity in the near term. We are confident in the actions we are taking to navigate current market conditions and drive long-term value creation. And today marks the start of the next phase of our strategic journey. While our growth trajectory may be uneven in the face of volatile market conditions, we remain confident to grow low single digits over the long term. Based on our track record over these past three years, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments. Let me now hand the call over to Marie to talk more about our financials and outlook.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Our Q4 results were impacted by many of the same macroeconomic challenges we highlighted last quarter, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand, FX and inflation. That said, we are adapted quickly to the current environment and have demonstrated disciplined cost management to deliver solid results to finish out the year. In addition, we returned significant capital to our shareholders while successfully closing our acquisition of Poly. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities across our business and are confident we have the right strategy and portfolio of assets to drive long-term value creation. Today, I will cover our Q4 results and a recap of FY '22 followed by details about the cost transformation component of Future Ready, building upon the foundation we laid in our previous program and then finish with our outlook for Q1 and FY '23.  Turning to our Q4 results. Net revenue was $14.8 billion in the quarter, down 11% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin was 18.4% in the quarter, down 1.2 points year-on-year driven by FX and increased pricing competition, particularly in PS. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion or 10.7% of revenue, down 18% year-on-year.  In Q4, we installed further rigor at our cost management with OpEx down sequentially, excluding Poly. Year-on-year, we reduced our OpEx spend by nearly $350 million by prioritizing our spend and reducing variable compensation, while also capturing additional structural cost savings under our transformation plan. At the same time, we made and expect to continue to make prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas, which Enrique outlined earlier. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.1 billion, down 15%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $128 million for the quarter, up sequentially, largely as a result of our acquisition of Poly. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share decreased 10% to $0.85 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net expenses totaling $855 million, primarily related to acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangibles, tax adjustments and restructuring and other charges, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was zero, mostly due to onetime noncash tax expenses.  Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $10.3 billion, down 13% or 9% in constant currency. This compares to the 3-point headwind we had expected. PS revenue includes just two months of Poly's results following the successful completion of the acquisition in late August. Total units were down 21% on tough compares. We also saw pricing competition increase sequentially due to high-channel inventory across the industry. And while supply availability has improved significantly, constraints persisted in some pockets of the business.  Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was down 6% or 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 25% or 21% in constant currency, with FX remaining a significant headwind this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 6-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter, increasing 1 percentage point sequentially. By product category, revenue was down 23% for notebooks, up 1% for desktops and up 9% for workstations. We saw a strong recovery in gaming sequentially with revenue up solid double digits due to better product availability.  We have cleared most of our outstanding backlog and finished the quarter at a level consistent with pre-pandemic levels and with most of the remaining backlog reflecting higher value units. Personal Systems delivered $458 million of operating profit with operating margins of 4.5%. We ended the quarter below our long-term range for operating margins, largely as a result of particular weakness in EMEA Consumer revenue. Operating margin declined 2 points year-over-year due to currency and increased promotional activity given elevated industry channel inventory levels, especially in the Consumer business. These headwinds were partially offset by mix, lower commodity costs and variable compensation. We are pleased with the strong execution by the Poly team. They delivered just above breakeven operating profit and exceeded expectations for the quarter. In Print, our results reflect our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigated the highly dynamic environment. In Q4, total Print revenue was $4.5 billion, down 7% nominally or 6% in constant currency, driven by lower Supplies revenue and lower home hardware units combined with increased pricing competition in the home business. This was partially offset by higher office hardware units and ASPs and growth in Industrial Graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3% driven largely by continued supply constraints for certain IC components and lower Consumer demand. We have taken mitigating actions that are beginning to yield improvements in our supply availability at a pace consistent with our plans. While this has enabled us to make progress on reducing our backlog, we still expect print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23.  By customer segment, Commercial revenue increased 1% or 5% in constant currency, with units up 5%. Consumer revenue was down 7% or 4% in constant currency with units down 4%. Office continued with its gradual recovery, while pricing remained disciplined even as supply constraints eased incrementally. Home hardware demand softened further sequentially, particularly in the EMEA and Americas regions impacting ASPs as competitive pricing increased during the quarter. In Q4, Commercial recovery remained slow due to the gradual and uneven pace at which the return to office is progressing. There were pockets of strength with commercial hardware units up 5%. And in graphics, our Indigo business closed its largest deal to date for 50 digital presses with ePAC, a leader in the flexible packaging market. Supplies revenue of $2.7 billion declined just under 10% in constant currency, slightly better than expected as demand weakness appeared to stabilize in the quarter. The decline was driven primarily by continued Consumer weakness, particularly in the EMEA region and the slow recovery in the office, partially offset by favorable pricing actions and continued market share gains in ink and toner. Supplies finished FY '22 down nearly 7% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for approximate 1-point headwind related to the exit of our Russia business, the year-on-year decline in Supplies came in consistent with our original guidance range of a decline of low to mid-single digits.  Print operating profit increased $73 million to $903 million, up 9%, yielding an exceptional operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.9 points year-on-year, driven by favorable overall pricing and OpEx management, including lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher commodity costs. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation in Q4. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, exceeding our guidance for the quarter. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, flat sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was offset by the decrease in days of inventory. In Q4, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders. This included $750 million in share repurchases and $249 million in cash dividends. At the end of FY '22, we successfully finished our transformation plan, generating better-than-expected structural cost savings. Our strong performance and our value plan over the past three years, including our capital return and broader capital allocation priorities were made possible in part by the transformation journey we have been on. In 2019, we launched a three-year plan to unlock significant value and become a leaner, simpler and more digitally enabled company. We took decisive actions aligned to the principles of our value creation plan to become closer to our customers by simplifying our operations and replatforming the company. In total, our transformation program delivered growth annualized run rate savings of over $1.3 billion and reduced our headcount by approximately 7,700 as expected. As part of our simplification journey, we changed our operating model, moving to one commercial organization, and created strong centers of excellence to drive efficiency and faster decision-making. In addition, we optimized our real estate footprint, creating efficient digital workspaces as we transitioned to a hybrid work model. We also made significant progress in optimizing our manufacturing footprint and continuing to enhance resiliency while reducing our cost structure. Digital replatforming was another defining enabler of our transformation efforts. We built a new digital backbone for the company with the deployment of one ERP system, creating the ability to deploy additional tools and capabilities. In addition, this new platform provides the foundation upon which we can drive incremental cost savings as well as build new businesses with different business models as we move into FY '23 with the launch of our Future Ready Transformation Plan. We are now launching cost action efforts as part of that Future Ready program, continuing to the next phase of our transformation. We'll continue to take actions to reduce structural costs across COGS and OpEx to drive efficiencies while protecting the investments necessary to accelerate our transformation, ensuring we are well positioned to drive long-term growth. This program is expected to run for three years, and we expect to generate at least $1.4 billion in gross annual run rate structural cost savings by the end of FY '25. We expect at least 40% of the run rate savings or approximately $560 million to be achieved by the end of FY '23. We have line of sight to these savings, and we also have a good funnel of additional cost savings opportunities that we are betting to help us exceed these targets. The total expected restructuring charge is approximately $1 billion, which includes approximately $200 million in noncash charges in FY '23. We anticipate approximately $600 million of the total charges to be in FY '23 with the rest split roughly equally in FY '24 and FY '25. As Enrique mentioned, we take workforce reductions very seriously and with the utmost care, but they remain critical to the long-term health of HP. In total, we expect to reduce headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 over the next three years. In addition to labor-related restructuring charges of roughly $700 million, we expect additional non-labor charges related to IT, real estate and other corporate charges. We anticipate the gross savings from this next phase of transformation will partially offset the challenging macro in the near term and incremental investments in growth opportunities we discussed earlier. In summary, these actions will help enable us to build a stronger HP. Looking forward to our Q1 and FY '23 outlook. We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities and growth in our end markets, including our key growth areas and our strategy to create value for shareholders over time. Given the current macro environment, we do expect near-term volatility, in particular, keep the following in mind related to Q1 and FY '23 financial outlook. Given the challenging macro environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling multiple scenarios based on several assumptions. For FY '23, we see a wide range of potential outcomes, which are reflected in the outlook ranges we are providing today. Consistent with our Q4 results and ongoing strategy, we will continue to rigorously manage our OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. This is made possible in part by the decisive cost actions we are announcing today. We expect currency to be about an approximate 5% year-over-year headwind in Q1 and 5% for FY '23 reflecting the current strength of the U.S. dollar. In Personal Systems, we expect the overall PC market to see an approximate 10-point unit decline versus FY '22. Many of the recent challenges we have seen in FY '22 will likely continue into FY '23, including softer demand in both Consumer and Commercial and higher channel inventory levels across the industry. We anticipate these factors will put continued pressure on overall pricing at least through the first half of '23. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to improve as we focus on higher-value categories, including commercial premium and hybrid work solutions. We expect Personal Systems margins to be below the low end of our 5% to 7% target range through at least the first half of FY '23 driven by the high normalization of industry channel inventory levels and then improve into the second half as channel inventory normalizes and our transformation-related cost actions start to more meaningfully impact our cost structure. And regarding Q1 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be down mid-single digits sequentially. In Print, in terms of the overall print market sizing, we expect it to be down approximately 3% year-on-year driven by the challenging macro environment and slower-than-expected return to the office. In the office market, we continue to expect the market sizing to be approximately 80% of our pre-pandemic projections. In home, we expect the market to be down in '23 versus the exceptional performance during COVID, but still above our pre-pandemic projections. We expect continued softness in Consumer demand and favorable pricing in Commercial units, offsetting some normalization in Consumer pricing, particularly in the first half of '23.  In terms of our print hardware supply chain, we expect constraints to continue, particularly in office hardware, at least through first half of FY '23. We expect Print margins for FY '23 to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range, driven by the resiliency of our portfolio and disciplined pricing and cost management including our transformation efforts to reduce our print fixed cost structure, as Enrique mentioned. And finally, regarding Supplies revenue, we expect to decline low to mid-single digits in FY '23 in constant currency, consistent with our long-term outlook. For FY '23, we expect to be within that range in aggregate. But for the first half of '23, we expect to be at similar levels to Q4 given the macro environment and tough compares. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which includes approximately $400 million of restructuring cash charges. From a seasonality perspective, we expect the second half to be stronger than the first, largely consistent with our net earnings combined with the fact that our first quarter is typically lower given the timing of prior year variable comp. Furthermore, normal, quarterly sequential seasonality does not apply for FY '23, given the dynamic macro environment. But we do expect some improvement in our revenue trajectory in the second half of '23. That said, we expect our key growth businesses collectively will continue to grow double digits organically in FY '23 as we continue to invest in innovation and adjacent market opportunities. With regard to OpEx, we expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure as part of our transformation, particularly in our core businesses, where we expect OpEx to be down year-on-year. However, including Poly, we do expect total OpEx to be up year-on-year. In addition, for FY '23, we expect OI&E expense will be approximately $0.5 billion, consistent with our Q4 exit run rate. Moving to capital allocation. We are not making any changes to our capital return framework. As we have discussed in the past, we are committed to our strategy of returning 100% of free cash flow to shareholders over time as long as our gross leverage ratio remains under 2x, and there aren't any better return opportunities in order to maintain our credit rating. Given the challenging current environment, consistent with our disciplined financial management, we expect share repurchases will be modest near term based on our FY '23 outlook today.  Lastly, we announced today that we are raising our annual dividend by 5% to $1.05 per share, reflecting confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. We have raised our dividend every year since separation in late 2015. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.80 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.57. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.60. And FY '23 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.22 to $2.62. For FY '23, we expect our free cash flow to be in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion, which is net of about $400 million in restructuring cash outflows. Before we open for Q&A, I want to leave you with the following thoughts: First, as part of our Future Ready plan, we are taking clear and decisive actions, which includes aggressive structural cost reductions as we have just shared.  Second, we are adapting to these challenging market conditions with our Future Ready cost transformation program, which includes plans to drive significant cost savings. Third, we're confident in the long-term growth opportunities and are capitalizing on these opportunities by investing to become a more digital company with a more growth-oriented portfolio. Fourth, we have an experienced management team with a proven track record in up and down markets. We deliver on our financial commitments. We are disciplined in our capital allocation and committed to a strong balance sheet. In short, we are steadfast in our commitment to deliver long-term value creation. We are building a stronger HP, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you at FY '23. Operator, please open the line so we can take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani : I guess, Enrique, I'm hoping you just start off talking a little bit more about the transformation plan. And then what I'd love to understand is what do you think HP looks like after the transformation plan is done, maybe in terms of the growth rates on the operating margin profile versus what you've seen historically? I want to just to understand what would be different about HP post the current transformation plan? And then if you can also just touch on, how do we think about net savings, the gross numbers you're talking about through this transformation? That would be helpful. 
Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Amit. So first of all, we -- because of the transformation, we think that we will continue to support the guide that we provided last year about sustained revenue and profit growth year-over-year. This has been the goal that we had before and continues to be the goal that we have now. From a business perspective, this will allow us to continue to accelerate our subscription and services business. We will be a more efficient company because we will be leveraging our digital infrastructure to support and to -- we will have transformed many of the key processes that we have and the mix of our business between the core businesses and what we call the growth businesses will also be different. This will be the key driver that we will expect to achieve through the transformation.
Marie Myers : Amit, maybe I will just add a comment, and good afternoon, regarding the savings. So we do expect at least $1.4 billion of gross run rate structural savings by the end of '25 and approximately $560 million of that by the exit of '23. Just to add, it will be a mix of both COGS and OpEx. And we look at this over time, as Enrique said, and we expect that these savings and investments that we're making are going to provide that significant flow-through over time.
Amit Daryanani : Got it. And if I can just follow up on the Print margins. They've held up really well despite the decline we see on the supply side of the business. As you think about the performance especially in the last three, four quarters on Print margins, what are the two, three things that you think made margins to sit at 20% right now, near 20%? And then what do you think is the durability of this margin level at least in the first half of next year?
Marie Myers : Yes. No, thanks very much, Amit. So look, as you said, we're really pleased with the Print margins that were at 19.9% in Q4, which is actually at the high end of our expected range. And that increase, if we look at it from a year-on-year perspective, is a combination of things. Firstly, we've demonstrated disciplined OpEx management that's contributed along with overall pricing durability, as you mentioned. And I think both of these factors combined have really helped to sort of play into our performance. As we look into next year, we do expect once again to be at the high end of the range. And it's really contributed by both the resiliency of the portfolio, our strategy, a combination of that pricing management. I think that we've really mastered along, obviously, with the benefits of the Future Ready Transformation program that we just announced today as well.
Enrique Lores : Yes. If you remember, we announced a plan to rebalance profitability between hardware and supplies [three] (ph) years ago. We have been executing on that. This quarter, we shared that more than 50% of the printers were profit upfront. So all this has also helped. But as Marie said, we expect to build a business within range during 2023.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.
Shannon Cross: My first question is looking at your growth areas. I think we understand where there's pressure on your model. But maybe if you could talk a bit more about the $11 billion in revenue that you've generated, and I'm not sure if that's like pro forma for Poly or it doesn't include Poly. I think it is excluding. I'm sure it's very small print. But if we can think about each one and their potential growth contributions, and maybe how to think about the margin potential for each one of those? And then I have a follow-up question.
Enrique Lores : Sure. So yes, you are right, Shannon. The $11 billion does not include Poly so this will be on top of $11 billion that we explained. And the goal that we had at the beginning of the year was for them to be about $10 billion. So this is almost $1 billion more than what the plan was. I think what we can say at this point is all of them grew double digit during 2022, and we expect collectively to grow again double digit in 2023. And as we share, if we look at the year, the gross margin was above the gross margin of the company. In some of them, we are still in investment mode, and we know we need to continue to invest to continue to accelerate the growth. And this is one of the reasons why we have been working on the transformation for a few months now because we know that we need to both compensate for some of the challenges that we see on the market side given the slowdown in some of the markets, but we also need to continue to invest on the growth initiatives because they will carry the growth of the company and the value of the company in the future.
Shannon Cross : Okay. And then Marie, if you can talk a bit about on the cash flow side of things. I mean, you're guiding $3 billion, $3.5 billion. I assume that includes restructuring. Maybe it doesn't. But just in general, how do we think about sort of normalized cash flow for this model after you go through or as you go through the restructuring plan and areas where maybe you can draw down in terms of working capital? And just again, I think people are trying to understand maybe when you would get back to where you can buy back stock, just your comfort level and what you're seeing in terms of cash flow?
Marie Myers : Absolutely. And good afternoon, Shannon. So as you said, the cash flow guide is $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And just a clarification, that actually does include the $400 million of restructuring cash flow. So just take that into account in your model.  Now in terms of how to think about free cash flow, as you know, it tracks with net earnings. But in any quarter, as you've seen just in our results, in the last couple of quarters, it's driven very much by the mix of business that we see in the quarter and changes in working capital. And those items include everything from the restructuring, the bonus, et cetera, and also just adjustments that we make to our inventory level. So you're going to expect that there's going to be a level of seasonality around it as well. And then as we're thinking -- specifically about the first quarter that's coming up, we would say it's going to be -- we're going to guide here to a lower number because we expect typically from a seasonality perspective, that's when we pay out the bonus that we accrue in the prior year. And also, we expect specifically in Q1 just due to the fact we've got this combination of both the unfavorable business mix from the top line pressure of Personal Systems, you combine that with the bonus payout and restructuring and with the increase in AR from contract manufacturers, which is partially offset by continued reductions we're taking at inventory level, we expect that our cash flow in Q1 is probably likely to be negative towards breakeven. So I know I've said a lot there is definitely a lot of factors going into driving the linearity in our cash flow. But once again, still very confident in the guide that we've given for the year of $3 billion to $3.5 billion. And then I'll just turn it to Enrique if he wants to comment at all with respect to our repo strategy.
Enrique Lores : Sure. We can talk about that. We also shared in the prepaid remarks that we are not changing our capital allocation plan. But as we have said before, we are going to be returning to shareholders 100% of free cash flow unless better opportunities arise and always within the our -- where we will stay within our leverage rate. In Q4, we completed the acquisition of Poly. We did it one quarter before we were planning, and therefore, during the beginning of the year, we are going to slow down or moderate our share buyback to -- in alignment with our plan. But our plan is to go back to the original plan in the second half as we will have more stronger situation for a free cash flow perspective. And that's our plan.
Marie Myers : Yes. I'll just add, it is important that we're going to ensure that we at least offset dilution from employee benefit plans as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. I'm wondering if you could specify how significant the backlog drawdown was in the quarter, just so we can get a sense of what kind of baseline normalized order of revenue growth was. And then you provided some context on your expectation for Q1 revenues for PCs to be down mid-single digits sequentially. I'm wondering if you can comment on your revenue expectations for Q1 overall and for fiscal '23. For the next four quarters, Dell is calling for revenues to be down in the teens. I'm wondering if you see a more optimistic outlook than that? And I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores : Sure. I'll take the question on market and then Marie will talk about Q1. So from an order and projection perspective, Toni, the way we are modeling the PC market for next year is to -- we are expecting that it will be declining by 10%. And from a backlog perspective, we basically cleaned the majority of our backlog during Q4. And we are back to where we were before the pandemic, which is one of the reasons why we expect the market to be in the minus 10% range in -- during 2023. Marie, do you want to talk about Q1?
Marie Myers : So just on the revenue per PS, we do expect it to be down mid-single digits sequentially. And obviously, that's driven by all the conditions we've talked about earlier today. And as you know, we normally don't guide revenue, but we do expect that normal seasonality won't apply in '23. So we'll see some improvements in the overall revenue trajectory in the back half. But overall, we do expect to see PS revenue down here in Q1.
Enrique Lores : And the situation is different on the print side, especially on the Commercial side, we continue to have some shortages as we were expecting. So backlog for Commercial print remains elevated and we expect to clearly during the first half of 2023.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. I still don't feel like we have a pretty good sense of what your range of outcomes is for revenue growth for 2023. But -- maybe you can address that. But just following up with the second question, you said Supplies would be back to your traditional model of down kind of low to mid-single digits. But you pointed to minus 10% growth in the first half. So that means you're expecting Supplies to grow in the second half. That's pretty well the simple math. And why did we have this big perturbation from model the last couple of quarters and maybe the next couple of quarters. Is this just channel inventory correction? Or why do we have a sudden reset off of model that is minus 3% to minus 5% and minus 10% and then it kind of bounces back.
Enrique Lores : Sure. So as I explained in the last call, the changes in the performance in the supply business is really driven by a slowdown of Consumer demand. We started to see this at the end of Q3. And as we were expecting, we have continued to see that in Q4, and we project that this will continue. Of course, as demand gets adjusted, there is an inventory adjustment, but this is not the reason why we are seeing -- the impact in supply is really driven by adjustments in user demand. . For the full year, as we said last quarter and we continue to say, we expect the business to go back to our original guide. And this means that the second half will have stronger performance than the first half. I think as we look at quarter growth as one of the key metrics, I think it's important to realizing that adjustments done in previous quarter have a lot of impact on growth. So we don't think it's the best way to measure the health of the business because anything that happened a quarter ago will have an impact on what is the next quarter. But again, the big impact is driven by a slowdown on Consumer demand. And I think it's also important to highlight that our channel inventory is in a very good position today. I mentioned last quarter that it was slightly above where we wanted it to be. We are now totally within the position where we like to be.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. I've got two as well. Just going back to kind of Toni's questions a little bit. I guess on the context of the revenue side, just correct me if I'm wrong, the 10% number with regard to PCs being down, that's a unit number. So as we see ASP pressure come into play, would the assumption be that revenue declines more? And then also, on the revenue context, I think there was a comment thrown out there about 3% with regard to print. I'm curious, was that 3% sequential down in this quarter? Or was that kind of the commentary for the full year? I was just confused by that comment around 3% decline in Print. And I got a follow-up.
Enrique Lores : Sure. Let me start with the print side, and then Marie will talk about PC. On the print side, the minus 3% is the expected decline in the overall market for print between fiscal year '23 and fiscal year '22, and there are different dynamics behind that number. We are expecting the Consumer number to -- the Consumer market to go down year-on-year, the office market to go slightly up and the industrial market to continue to grow like it has been growing during 2022. The net effect of all these three is a minus 3% growth year-on-year. Marie?
Marie Myers : Yes. No. With respect to revenue, I think as I said earlier with Toni's question, we do expect to see down mid-single digits sequentially. And as we mentioned earlier, I think Enrique commented in the prepared remarks, down 10% on units, and this is obviously with an environment where you've got higher channel imagery, there is going to be some ASP pressure. So we do anticipate though, as you get into the second half, that should clear out the inventory that we'll see some of the revenue adjust. But I think the way to think about it is that certainly the first half of PCs is going to be challenged. But obviously, we will be doing our best to offset all of this with an improvement in our mix. And I think we've demonstrated that over the last couple of quarters.
Aaron Rakers : Yes, that's very helpful. And then I guess the follow-up was on the channel inventory discussion. I guess, do you see that channel inventory is the assumption right now that channel inventory normalizes as we get towards the mid part of calendar '23. Any context of how you would currently characterize your own channel inventory in that?
Marie Myers : Sure. If we're talking just Personal Systems, absolutely. We expect that the inventory will remain elevated through the first half, but then normalize in the second half. And then as I think Enrique said earlier, Print is in really good shape, both supplies and hardware.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.
Erik Woodring : I have two as well. Maybe Enrique I start with you. This is your third consecutive kind of three-year cost cutting or transformational plan, I should say, HP's third consecutive at more than kind of $1 billion of gross cost savings, each plan. So I guess if you take a step back and you think about the last maybe almost a decade in that context. Why have the prior plans, I guess, not been enough? Or what are you doing with this specific plan that you haven't necessarily already done, given even last summer, you talked about portfolio SKU rationalization and digital transformation. So just maybe if you could help us understand that. And then
Enrique Lores : Sure. Thank you, Erik. I would say there are two things. First is the world is in a very different position now than when it was three years ago, but also the company is in a very different position. In fact, a significant part of the savings that we are going to be able to achieve now are really driven by the investments that we have made during the last 3 years that really are enabling a significant part of it. For example, when we talk about continuing to work on the digital transformation, we can do it now because of all the investments that we have made during the last three years. Additionally to that, when we look at the return on this investment, it really brings -- has very good results. We are going to be investing $1 billion, and we will get, as Mario was saying, $1.4 billion of run rate savings at the end of '25. So really very solid return. And on top of that, this will also help us to continue to invest in our growth businesses. We think that it is important that as we go through a challenging marketing conditions during the next quarter, we continue to invest in the future businesses of the company, and this transformation is going to enable us to do that going forward.
Erik Woodring : Okay. And then maybe Marie, this one would be for you. Net debt is up a little $4 billion to $5 billion year-over-year. Obviously, Poly had an impact on that. Your gross leverage is creeping towards the higher end of your 1.5x to 2x range -- target range. And so would you be willing to go over 2x temporarily? I mean the math says, you could technically get over 2x over the next 12 months. So are you willing to let leverage get over 2x? And/or why not try to work down some of that just given the more uncertain macro backdrop, rising interest rates, et cetera?
Marie Myers : Yes. No worries. No, we're very much committed to the strategy. I think we've articulated of staying inside our range. So absolutely, we'll continue to execute against our strategy.
Enrique Lores : We think that the world is, as we have said, very volatile and having a strong balance sheet is really important. So this is why we will stay below 2, keeping investment-grade rating is critical for many of our big deals with large corporations. So this is one of the big reasons why we want to stay there. And if everything we will deliver, we are not planning to go beyond the range.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. 
Ruplu Bhattacharya : It's Ruplu filling in for Wamsi today. I have two questions. Enrique, one on PCs and one on print. In the prepared remarks, with respect to Personal Systems, you said that you're not happy with the share performance. It looks like HP lost some share, both sequentially and year-on-year. But I'm sure you've already done in this quarter what other companies are doing, which is reducing price. And with the inventory -- channel inventory remaining high for half of fiscal '23, can you talk about your strategy in Personal Systems. How do you think you can gain share? And what are some of the things that -- you talked about execution. So what are some of the things you can do better to gain share in this year?
Enrique Lores : Sure. As we have explained in the past, our strategy and our goal is profitable growth is not to gain share for the sake of gaining share. And therefore, we are very judicious and very careful as we look at deals in different geographies, different segments to make sure that the deals make financial sense for us. This quarter, we saw very aggressive pricing in many countries in the world, especially in the Consumer segment, especially EMEA. And in many cases, we decided not to participate. But we also know that to maintain a strong leadership position in this market, we need to regain share. And this is -- and we think that the cost reduction activities that we have been working on for some time are going to be part of the Future Ready plan, are going to help us to be more competitive and help us to win share during 2023, which is our goal. And that's really the key -- this will be the key driver of the share growth that we expect to have.
Ruplu Bhattacharya : Okay. Can I ask a follow-up on the Print segment? As people are going back to work, how do you see the relative growth rate of your home subscription business in spending versus the commercial Managed Print Services business are either one -- is one more profitable than the other? And then just as you look at print margins throughout the year, you guided for the full year to remain at the high end of the range. But should we think that the first half going to second half, your Print margins normalize somewhat towards within that range. So can you just give us your thoughts on the relative margins of those two subscription businesses? And how do you see the growth rates for them as well as the margin progression this year?
Enrique Lores : Sure. From a margin perspective, similar to what happens on the transactional side, the home, Instant Ink program is more profitable than the Managed Print Service program. That’s driven by the fact that we own almost all the technology stack. From a growth perspective, though, they are not related. We have a lot of opportunity to grow the consumer subscription business and to grow as well the Managed Print Service business, especially as we start seeing some slow but some recovery on the office side.
Marie Myers : And just on the margins, as I said in our prepared remarks, we do expect to be at the high end of the range. But in terms of just how to think about it half-on-half, just in the first half, we do expect a little more softness in Consumer due to some of the favorable pricing. So we'll see that probably in the first half, some normalization.
Operator: Your final question today comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.
Krish Sankar : I have two of them. First one, either for Marie or Enrique, on your cost reduction plan. With the portfolio optimization, how should we think about the TAM opportunity for HP in FY '25, given that I understand you want to do profitable growth. But do you think with the portfolio optimization and the headcount reduction, you're prioritizing one over the other? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores : Yes. So our portfolio optimization have many different elements. Let me highlight a couple of them. First, we are going to maintain, and in some cases, increase our investment in the growth businesses. As I said before, we expect to get double-digit growth in 2023. And going forward, they will continue to become a more relevant part of the company.  On the other side, we also know we have opportunities to optimize some of the businesses in the core side. For example, during 2021 and '22 because of the component shortages, we have to duplicate many SKUs. We had to duplicate investments in boards, in many different parts to compensate for component shortages. This is clearly now an opportunity to simplify, to rationalize and to reduce investment and cost in the cost side. And there are many other things, but these are two good examples of the things you will see us doing.
Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Super helpful, Enrique. And then a quick follow-up, actually, a two-part follow-up. On the 10% PC units down, is that for FY '23 or is it for calendar '23? And can you just help us understand what your calendar '22 baseline is?  And then the second part of the question is, I think, Marie, you mentioned how second half of FY '23 should get better as inventory digest for PCs. I'm just kind of curious, is that really a function of inventory digestion and you expect demand to improve? Or is that -- because it seems like most companies expect a second half 2023 recovery, but with an uncertain demand environment, what is the confident level on that improvement?
Enrique Lores : Sure. So let me start with a minus 10%. The minus 10% is what we expect the unit decline to be during our fiscal year that goes from November '22 to November '23. We are using that number because we think it's more relevant to understand the guide that we provided today. Marie?
Marie Myers : Yes. And just on the second half, just bear in mind that not only the channel inventory will be in better shape, but we also will see the impact of the Future Ready Transformation program. So we'll expect to see those gross run rate structural savings that I mentioned about $560 million kick in, in the back half as well. So that's another driver along with -- we should see supply chain improved, particularly in print and high-end PCs. And I'd just add that at the high end of the guide, the upside is really coming from a better macro, but we're not counting on it. So that's what could drive us to the high end of the range.
Enrique Lores : Thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. But you can see that we are taking the actions under our control to manage the situation and to improve the situation. Clearly, we know that we need to both continue to reduce our cost structure, but also to invest for the future of the company because I don't think anybody can predict when the rebound of the economy will happen. But what we want to make sure is that we have a stronger HP when this happened, so we can take advantage of that. So really thank you, everybody, for joining. And Happy Thanksgiving for those of you in the U.S. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q3  (2022-08-30 09:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2022 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Orit, and thanks to everyone who is joining the call today. As part of our earnings today, we will cover three important themes. First, we will talk about the unexpected and very abrupt shift in the macroeconomic environment and how this is challenging our overall business in the short term. Second, we will enumerate the decisive actions we are taking in response to this macroeconomic challenge, including continued progress in our structural cost reduction programs while we continue prioritizing our investments in growth areas. Third, we will convey that our confidence in the medium- and longer-term prospects of our markets and growth drivers remains intact. We are firmly committed to our strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term and disciplined capital return to shareholders. First, regarding the macroeconomic environment, like many companies, we are managing through some challenging market conditions with a focus on what we can control. Inflation increased in many parts of the world, and this led to lower consumer spending for our product categories. And demand in Europe worsened against the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war. Although we highlighted pockets of consumer softness during our Q2 call, the environment deteriorated more rapidly late in the third quarter. The strength of our commercial business, particularly in the enterprise, helped us to partially offset declines in consumer demand. Still, the fact that we remain supply constrained did not allow us to fully rebalance. As a result, our net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter. That's down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency year-over-year. Despite this, we were still able to deliver non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 in line with our previously provided outlook. This reflects our very disciplined cost management and pricing strategy as well as our continued ability to shift more of our portfolio to higher-growth, higher-value segments. And while we cannot control how the economic situation evolves in the coming months, there are some very clear actions we can take to mitigate the impact of near-term headwinds and drive continued progress against our long-term growth strategy. And we are taking a very measured approach with a focus on five clear priorities. First, we are optimizing our performance by staying disciplined in our pricing and increasing our focus on pockets of profitable growth, such as premium, peripherals, services and solutions. Second, given volatility is becoming the norm, we are focused on continuously improving the way we respond to it. We are taking decisive actions to address issues that have surfaced due to the abrupt changes we have seen in the industry. And we view this as an opportunity to further improve our ability to adapt to quick transitions in the market in the future. Third, we are doubling down on our growth portfolio while protecting our core business. Collectively, our key growth businesses once again grew double digits in Q3. And we remain on track to exceed our $10 billion revenue target for the full year. We expect our key growth businesses will continue to be a critical part of our growth strategy. Fourth, we are taking actions to reduce our variable spend and further reduce our structural cost by accelerating our digital transformation. We have already met or exceeded many of our objectives in our current transformation plan. And we're in the process of finalizing the foundation for a new multiyear transformation program that we plan to share with you during our Q4 call. And finally, we are maintaining our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders, and we expect to exceed our commitment to return $16 billion to shareholders as part of our value creation plan. These are the right areas of focus regardless of the macro environment. In times like this, they become even more important, and the actions we are taking will enable us to continue building a stronger HP. Let me now spend a few minutes discussing our Q3 business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue declined 3%, primarily driven by softening consumer demand for our categories and more price competition. In constant currency, PS revenue was flat in the quarter. We delivered operating profit margin of 6.9%. This is at the high end of our target range, driven by disciplined pricing and our mix shift to high-value segments and robust cost management. Within commercial, our Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18% with commercial premium and workstations up double digits. And commercial was more than 2/3 of our PS revenue mix in Q3. We are taking actions to optimize consumer performance, and we are focusing on pockets of growth across our portfolio, such as premium and peripheral, which grew double digits this quarter. We saw overall higher channel inventory levels in the quarter, and we expect pricing will become more aggressive in Q4 to address this. While this environment creates some near-term market uncertainty, our long-term view of the PC market and its adjacencies has not changed. And we have confidence in the trajectory of Personal Systems over time. One source of our confidence is our acquisition of Poly, which we closed yesterday. We are thrilled to welcome the Poly team to HP. Poly accelerates our expansion and scale in two key growth businesses, peripheral and workforce solutions. Poly devices and software, combined with HP's leadership across compute, device management and security creates a comprehensive portfolio of work solutions. We continue to receive very positive feedback from resellers, partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. We expect the transaction will be accretive to non-GAAP EPS and in fiscal year '23. With the Poly deal completed, I am pleased to share that Dave Shull, Poly's former CEO, will be joining HP to lead a newly created workforce services and solutions organization. This is a big step forward for our business that will allow us to drive a more integrated and expansive commercial services growth agenda across Personal Systems and Print. Dave is a terrific executive with extensive global experience, and he will be a great addition to our leadership team. Let me now turn to our Print business. Like PS, consumer softness and supply constraints weighed on our results. Specifically, Print revenue declined 6% or 5% in constant currency, with supply revenue declining 9%. We delivered operating profit margin of 19.9%, which is well above our target range and reflects our disciplined pricing and cost management in a tough market as well as commercial hardware supply constraints. We also made progress against our plans to rebalance system profitability and accelerate in key growth areas. HP+ and Big Tank printers continue to become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing more than 50% of printer shipments in the quarter. And our strong focus on Big Tank in emerging markets allowed us to gain share. We delivered another quarter of double-digit revenue and cumulative subscriber growth in our consumer subscription business. This model is proving to be resilient, and its value proposition is even more attractive to consumers in this environment. Industrial graphics impressions also grew year-over-year, and we built a strong funnel with recovery in all segments. And we delivered double-digit revenue growth in as customers increase their deployment of our thermoplastic solutions. Across both Personal Systems and Print, we continue to drive an aggressive innovation agenda. Last week, we kicked off a global roadshow with our top channel partners. And I will tell you what I told them. We have built our strongest portfolio ever. We have introduced more than 100 new products and solutions over the past 18 months. Much of this innovation is being driven by the rise of the hybrid office. Our devices are what's enabling people to connect, create and collaborate across multiple locations and do it securely. Last week, we introduced our HP Instant Ink for small business and our new LaserJet Pro with HP+. This is an intuitive printing system that's tailor-made to meet the unique needs of small businesses by enabling greater productivity, effortless device management and advanced security. And in Personal Systems, we just unveiled our next-gen Dragonfly Folio, a beautiful PC that has been thoughtfully crafted for hybrid work. Enhanced by our HP Presence video conferencing solution, the Dragonfly's advanced camera capabilities, automatic voice leveling and background noise filtering technologies and digital temp create a superb remote work experience. The Dragonfly is also made using ocean-bound plastic and other recycled materials, which supports our overall commitment to sustainable impact. We continue to advance our efforts in this area. We announced last week a significant expansion of our HP Amplify Impact program, which mobilizes and rewards our channel partners as they make progress on their own sustainability and diversity goals. This work is differentiating our brand, motivating our people and strengthening our communities. Looking ahead, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging. Consumer softness is likely to continue in the near term. We also see some companies taking a more measured approach to their spending and new orders showing signs of softening demand in commercial categories. And although we have made significant progress on supply chain, some shortages remain. Given that we do not currently foresee an economic rebound in the short term, we believe the prudent thing to do is to adjust our Q4 outlook, which Marie will discuss in her remarks. But like all economic downturns, we also believe that the current situation is temporary. And just as market conditions deteriorated quickly, they could also rebound quickly. We have consistently proven our ability to manage the Company through up and down markets. We are prepared for multiple scenarios and ready to act as needed. Most importantly, the fundamentals from which our long-term strategy is built have not changed. Hybrid work is here to stay. Gaming will continue to grow in popularity. The rise of digital services and subscriptions is unlocking new business models. And industrial markets are being disrupted by new technologies. These are long-term secular trends. Each of them plays to HP's strength. And we are confident in our long-term growth targets even as we take the actions necessary to mitigate near-term headwinds. To give you additional insight into our performance and outlook, I'm going to pass it over to Marie.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Enrique mentioned, our Q3 results were impacted by macroeconomic challenges, including a significant slowdown in consumer demand in our categories: inflation, currency and geopolitical challenges. We took swift actions across the levers within our control to help address these headwinds, focusing on rigorous financial management in both our costs and our investments across our businesses. In addition, we are executing on our strategy and returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Disciplined financial management, particularly OpEx and cost management, is core to our DNA at HP, and we are confident in our ability to navigate adeptly in up and down market conditions. Furthermore, we continue to realize structural cost savings from our transformation program and see additional opportunities to drive significant cost reductions ahead of us. Despite these recent challenges, we remain confident in both our end markets and strategy to drive the long-term value creation. With that, let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $14.7 billion in the quarter, down 4% nominally and 2% in constant currency. Approximately 2 points or half of the decline was due to the change in estimated sales and marketing incentives benefit in our prior year results. Gross margin was 19.8% in the quarter, down 2.4 points year-on-year, driven by the change in estimated incentives benefit in the prior year and currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion or 10.3% of revenue, down 20% year-on-year. In Q3, we installed further rigor in our cost management. We reduced our OpEx spend by over $370 million year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter by prioritizing our variable spend in R&D and marketing aligned with our growth categories. Lower variable compensation given the more challenging business environment was also a key driver. At the same time, we are making prudent and targeted investments where we anticipate significant opportunity to drive growth, including our key growth areas which I will touch upon in a few moments. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, down 8%, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $104 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $1.04 with a diluted share count of approximately 1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $40 million, primarily related to non-operating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and Russia exit charges. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.08. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.1 billion, down 3% and flat in constant currency. Total units were down 25% as a result of a decline in chrome demand as well as the rapid deterioration of demand late in the quarter, particularly in our consumer business. In addition, we continue to see ongoing supply chain constraints as expected in some pockets of PS. In spite of those challenges, there were several bright solid demand in our higher-value categories across commercial and consumer, consistent with our strategy. Commercial revenue constituted over 2/3 of our Personal Systems revenue in Q3, and our commercials Windows-based revenue grew approximately 18%, with units up 6%. Mobile workstation revenue was up approximately 60%. Consumer premium revenue was up 10%. The long-term secular tailwinds we continue to see in Personal Systems, including hybrid work, give us confidence in our long-term outlook. And regarding hybrid work, an area of focus, I want to give a warm welcome to our Poly team. We anticipate significant opportunity ahead from both a strategic and financial perspective, with clear opportunities to capitalize on both secular tailwinds and synergies to help drive long-term revenue and non-GAAP operating profit and EPS growth. I will cover the financial impact of Poly shortly. Let's drill into the details. Commercial revenue was up 7% year-on-year and up 11% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 20% year-on-year and down 18% in constant currency. FX was clearly a key factor in our results this quarter. As an example, currency was an approximate 5-point headwind to our Personal Systems business in EMEA this quarter. By product category, revenue was down 10% for notebooks, up 13% for desktops and up 38% for workstations. We also continued to perform well in many of our key growth areas, including peripherals and DAS, which was up strong double digits. Personal Systems delivered $695 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%, flat sequentially as we continue to execute despite the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Operating margin declined 1.5 points year-on-year primarily due to currency and higher costs particularly in consumer, partially offset by lower OpEx, including lower R&D and variable compensation and improved commercial product mix. In Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the breadth of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q3, total Print revenue was $4.6 billion, down 6% nominally and down 5% in constant currency, driven by lower supplies revenue and lower print hardware units. This was partially offset by higher home and office hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and Instant Ink services. Total hardware units declined 3%, driven largely by lower-than-expected IC component availability and logistics constraints. While we have qualified additional suppliers and our Board redesigns are on track for product inclusion later this year, we still expect Print hardware constraints to extend into FY '23. By customer segment, commercial revenue declined 3% and down 1% in constant currency on unit declines of 15%. Consumer revenue was up 1% and 3% in constant currency with units down 1%. However, we saw some softening in home hardware demand sequentially, particularly on low-end units, impacting ASPs driven by the headwinds I described earlier. In Q3, commercial recovery continued to be impacted by the slow return to the office. In contrast, we did see solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D. In graphics, our flexible packaging business had another solid quarter and impressions have more than doubled versus pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM over time based on our current outlook. Supplies revenue of $2.8 billion declined 9% in constant currency. The decline was driven primarily by a significant reduction in consumer demand, driven by the challenging environment and continued normalization in home printing, partially offset by the gradual recovery in industrial print. The estimated impact of our decision to stop and permanently wind down our Russia business was approximately 1 point headwind to our supplies revenue year-on-year. Instant Ink services delivered another quarter of double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue, continuing to highlight the success of this business model even in a tougher macro. Print operating profit was $911 million, up 6%, yielding an operating margin of 19.9%. Operating margin increased 2.3 points, driven by rate improvement in hardware and OpEx management particularly lower variable compensation, partially offset by unfavorable mix. Now let's move to our transformation efforts, where we had another strong quarter of progress and are on track to exceed our $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by fiscal year end. During Q3, we delivered on numerous fronts, driving cost reductions to help drive long-term value creation. In Q3, we took several actions to drive structural cost reductions across both our manufacturing and real estate footprint. We executed two significant actions intended to optimize our factory footprint, driving both efficiency and increased global resiliency across our ink and laser hardware and supplies manufacturing. In addition, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint with site exits or reductions. Year-to-date, we have now executed 23 site optimizations, including eight site exits, and our overall plan has now reached 90 site optimizations since the start of our transformation. Our efforts have established a strong foundation that we fully intend to build upon going forward. As Enrique mentioned, we are currently finalizing our next phase of digital transformation focused on further cost and efficiency opportunities and plan to provide an update during our Q4 earnings call. Now let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days in the quarter, a sequential improvement of three days. Free cash flow and the sequential improvement in the cash conversion days came in below our expectations, driven primarily by the larger-than-expected sequential decrease in Personal Systems volume, delays in supply availability and unfavorable manufacturing linearity. And while we saw a meaningful improvement in our days of inventory in Personal Systems driven primarily by a decrease in commodities, these benefits were more than offset by higher days of Print inventory largely from assurance of supply and increased lead times. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect to see further improvement to our cash conversion cycle. Driving our outlook are our expectations for additional operational improvements, including further reductions to inventory levels, and we also expect some improvement in Personal Systems volume sequentially in Q4. Strong capital returns continue to be a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q3, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $255 million in cash dividends. Since the start of our value plan, we have returned over $15.6 billion to shareholders and remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by fiscal year end while also maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating. In Q4, we expect to continue to be active in our shares. Looking forward to Q4 and our fiscal year end, we continue to navigate the challenging macro and demand environment, including inflation, logistics constraints and pricing dynamics. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q4 and overall financial outlook. Given the changing demand environment driven by the headwinds I've described, we are modeling several scenarios based on a range of assumptions. For FY '22, we now see a wider range of outcomes. And as a result, we are lowering our overall outlook for FY '22. We expect to rigorously manage our overall cost structure and OpEx spend while continuing to prioritize investments where we see opportunities for growth. We expect currency to be approximately 3 percentage points, year-over-year headwind in Q4 and about 1.5 percentage points for FY '22, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. For Personal Systems, we expect many of the trends we saw in Q3 to continue, including softer demand in both consumer and commercial. We anticipate these factors will put some sequential pressure on overall pricing. We expect Personal Systems unit mix to continue to shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial premium and peripherals. With regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, we expect availability and most of our key components to improve with pockets of semiconductors to remain constrained into FY '23. We expect Personal Systems margins to be in the lower end of our 5% to 7% target range in Q4. And regarding Q4 Personal Systems revenue, we expect to be up slightly sequentially. Regarding Poly and our results, they will only reflect the last two months of the quarter, and we expect Poly to be accretive to non-GAAP EPS in FY '23. In Print, we expect further softening in demand in consumer similar to what we saw in the latter part of Q3, favorable pricing in higher-end consumer and commercial units and further normalization and mix as we expect commercial to gradually improve over time. With regard to Print supply chain, we expect, similar to Q3, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain hardware revenue in some areas. We expect these conditions to continue into FY '23, but with some incremental improvement in Q4. We now expect Print margins for Q4 specifically to once again be above the high end of our range, given continued hardware constraints and disciplined cost management. And finally, regarding supplies revenue, we are holding to our long-term outlook of a low- to mid-single-digit annual decline in constant currency. In the near term, over the next few quarters, we expect to see a decline of roughly low double digits, given the challenging environment. And as a result, we expect to be above our long-term range for FY '22. With regard to the impact of Poly on our financials in the fourth quarter and for FY '22, we expect a non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and approximately $0.05 headwind from Poly, including debt-related expenses and other deal-related costs. And for our GAAP diluted net earnings per share, we expect an incremental approximately $0.27 GAAP-only charge related to the Poly acquisition charges. And regarding free cash flow, we expected approximately $300 million cash flow headwind related to Poly acquisition and integration costs. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.94. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.79 to $0.89. Fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.86. For HP with Poly, we expect fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.54. We expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.17. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.02 to $4.12. And FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.78 to $3.88. For HP with Poly, we expect FY '22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.46 to $3.56. For FY '22, we now expect free cash flow for HP without Poly to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. For HP with Poly, we now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion. We continue to make progress against our priorities as we navigate through a very volatile fiscal 2022. And we are taking decisive actions with the levers within our control. Looking forward, we plan to provide guidance for FY '23 as part of our Q4 earnings call. Typically, we would provide guidance as part of our Annual Analyst Day or Security Analyst Meeting event. Moving forward, we plan to have these Analyst Day events biannually or as we have key updates to our strategy. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver long-term value creation and we look forward to sharing our progress with you. I'll stop here so we can take your questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Woodring: I guess maybe one for you, Enrique, and then one for you, Marie. Just on the pricing side, Enrique, maybe can you just give us a little more detail on the pricing actions you're taking and really in respect to kind of balancing or the challenge of balancing kind of softening demand with U.S. dollar strength and what that means for international sales. And if you could just specify again across Personal Systems and Print, that would be super. And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Erik. So I think that overall this quarter and similar to what we have done in the previous quarter, the team has done a very nice job managing pricing. If we look at year-on-year compares, we continue to see benefit of pricing, which is really driven by this. What we're starting to see is some erosion quarter-on-quarter, driven by both the increase in competitiveness that we see but also by the fact that, especially in PC, we see a high channel inventory. So, we expect that the pricing situation is going to become more aggressive, especially as we enter in Q4. From a currency perspective, traditionally, we have been very effective managing currency and pricing it. Again, depends also on what the competitive situation is and what the channel inventory is. So we may not be able to fully price it, but traditionally, this has been one of the key things that we have done over time.
Erik Woodring: Super. And then maybe, Marie, just a quick clarification question regarding Poly. Is the low single-digit sequential increase in fiscal 4Q revenue that you're talking about, is that overall revenue? And does that include the two months of Poly? And do we think about including that in Personal Systems for now? Are you thinking about re-segmenting? Just any color that you could provide there would be super helpful.
Marie Myers: Sure, Erik. So maybe I'll just start out by clarifying Poly. So for now, Poly will be in our Personal Systems external reporting going forward. And in terms of Poly, just a point of clarification, the guide actually just comprehends the last two months of Poly. So going forward, we do expect Poly to be accretive to our non-GAAP EPS. And in terms of the $0.05 headwind, there's a combination of both macro headwinds in there and plus debt-related expenses and integration costs. But net-net, Erik, it's roughly in line with our expectations. And just a point to follow up on Enrique's comments on currency, we do actually see a 3-point headwind in Q4 as well.
Enrique Lores: Let me share kind of the excitement that we have about the announcement we made yesterday. We think that the acquisition of Poly positions us very strongly as a leader in hybrid work. We see tremendous opportunity to add value, to innovate and to differentiate ourselves. So, we're really eager to start working with the Poly/HP team to start bringing new solutions to market and really expand that business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi: I'm wondering if you can just comment on the state of your backlog in the Personal Systems group. I think going into the quarter, you had anticipated not being able to reduce backlog because it was elevated. And I'm wondering whether backlog changed over the course of the quarter and whether you expect backlog to be at normal levels by changed over the course of I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Toni. I'll take that one. So backlog reduced during the quarter. As we had talked before, majority of the backlog was on the commercial side. And given the supply chain improvements that we had that we were expecting, we were able to clear some of it. We are entering Q4 still with more elevated backlog than normal, but it's lower than what we had at the beginning of the quarter.
Toni Sacconaghi: And do you expect to be at normal levels at the end of the fourth quarter? And maybe I'll ask my second question with -- at this point as well. Supplies was down 9%. That feels extremely abrupt, change from kind of the minus 3% level that you were at before. Was there any meaningful level of supplies channel inventory change? And I think you said you anticipated supplies being down double digits for the next few quarters. How do we know that there's not something structural akin to what we saw a couple of years ago happening with supplies? And why shouldn't we be worried about a pronounced negative mix shift, given supplies are higher margin than hardware, that once hardware goes back to kind of normalized pricing levels, printing margins could actually be below your trend?
Enrique Lores: Sure. So let me answer first the question on backlog. Our current plan is that we should be able to clear that during Q4, of course, depends on both how demand and supply able, but this is a plan that we have at this stage. And really, thinking about the question on supply because I -- this is really something that I wanted to clarify. The situation that we see today is radically different from what we saw in 2019. The slowdown that we have seen is driven by a reduction in demand especially in consumer, which is driven by the macroeconomic situation, very similar to what we are seeing in consumer PCs. If I look at the business fundamentals like share, they are behaving as expected. And even if channel inventory is slightly high, again driven by the slowdown we have seen in demand, overall channel inventory dollars are down year-on-year. So therefore, we see this as temporary. It's similar to other economic slowdowns that we have seen in the past and the speed of decline has been similar. But long term, we continue to project that supplies will decline in low to mid-single digits. And based on how we have designed the strategy of the Company, we don't need supplies to grow to meet our profit goals. And maybe one silver lining that I would like to share is something that we have seen through this quarter and that has confirmed the importance of the strategy is that subscription models are significantly more resilient than the traditional model, which really reinforces the need to continue to shift the business towards that model.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Shannon Cross: I was wondering sort of a follow-up to that. Can you talk a bit about the subscription business in maybe more detail? I'm just wondering percent of revenue or growth you've seen. Also, anything you can talk about with Print+ in terms of regaining share from the aftermarket? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. And Shannon, it's great to hear your voice again. So talking about Instant Ink, it continues to grow double digit, both revenue and net new subscribers so all this is doing really well. And really, this is driven by the fact that the value proposition to consumers is better than the traditional model. Cost of printing is lower. It is more convenient because they get consumables at home. And on top of that, it's more sustainable, which is really becoming, every time, more important. We continue to see growth in that space, and you are going to continue to shift the business in that direction. And as we have discussed in the past, we continue to see this as a platform to sell additional subscription programs. And as we shared a few months ago, we have example, the pilot of paper subscription in the U.S., and we are seeing good traction and good progress. So very, very good progress there. In terms of HP+, penetration continues to grow. We announced a new system on the laser side this quarter that had very strong reception. And as we have shared in the script, when we look at the combination of HP+ plus Big Ink and Big Toner, the combination of both is more than 50%, 5-0, of our hardware shipment this quarter. So this talks about the progress that we continue to make in that space; and this is really important, as we have said before, to rebalance profitability between hardware and supplies.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then you're basically about 16% -- I'm sorry, I'm echoing, one second. You're basically at about $16 billion for your cash return to shareholders. I'm curious as to how you're thinking about it, given the potential pressure on free cash flow, given the PC business slowdown. What we should think about in terms of your commitment to share repurchase and I mean, obviously, dividend growth over the coming year or two?
Enrique Lores: Sure. So for the rest of the year, we have shared that we are going to be exceeding the plan that we explained about three years ago to returning $16 billion of capital, so we will be above that plan. In terms of going forward, we don't foresee any changes in our capital allocation strategy. We are going to continue to execute the model that we have been sharing or the framework that we have been sharing during the last year. First of all, we think that for us, it's important to stay investment-grade credit rating. For us to be there, we need to be in a leverage ratio between 1.5 and 2, which is where we are now. And once we are in that range, our plan is to continue to return 100% of free cash flow to investors, either in dividend or in share buyback unless an M&A opportunity with a better return shows up. This is what we have been doing during the last quarter, and this continues to be the plan going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Sidney Ho: Last quarter, you had expected strength in the commercial PC for the rest of fiscal '22. Obviously, things have changed. It seems like third quarter commercial revenue did decline but better than consumer. When did you start seeing signs of demand weakness? Any color on how the quarter progress would be great? And do you have a view when you will start seeing some stabilization in that market? Then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure, thank you. So let me explain what we have seen on the commercial side, which is a little bit more complex than on the consumer side. But I think the influencing factors are the same. I mean, really how the macro situation has evolved and the implications of -- especially of inflation and the -- and companies in general becoming more cautious as they manage that investment. So what we are seeing is that from one side, companies continue to open significant deals because they see the need to improve the experience of their employees as they come to the office. Feedback that we get constantly from our customers is that the employees have now better systems to work from home than to work in the office, so they need to invest in the equipment in the office to convince them to come back to the office. And this is really creating a lot of opportunities and the funnel of opportunities that we see is very significant, significantly above what we need to make our sales targets. But at the same time, what we are seeing is once we win those deals, the conversion of those deals into orders has slowed down, which really reflects the fact that enterprises are being more cautious in how they manage their budgets for any new employees that are hired. And this is having an impact. This had an impact in Q3 of orders in the commercial space. Additionally to this, we also saw, at the end of the quarter, a reduction in sell-out, especially in the more transactional commercial categories, those that are closer to the consumer business. And this is what we are projecting is going to continue into Q4. And this was one of the elements that Marie commented that we are using in our guide because we have seen the slowdown in the commercial category.
Sidney Ho: Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is I want to get an update on your growth area initiatives. You kind of talked about the various businesses there. But you already had $5.6 billion of revenue in the first half of fiscal '22, so reaching $10 billion target doesn't seem to be a stretch. But can you talk about what you expect half over half in the second half of the fiscal year? Especially interested in your comments on gaming, given what we've been hearing about the weakness there, but also how does the full year target change with the inclusion of Poly?
Enrique Lores: Okay. So let me start from the end. When we talk about being above $10 billion, we are not including the additional revenue coming from Poly. We were not planning to close the deal in Q4 and the target was without them. So what we have seen for the category is continue of the overall categories' double-digit growth. And I -- let me refresh what these categories are because the consumer subscriptions, is workforce solutions. It is gaming. It is industrial print. It is industrial print and 3D and is peripheral. So all these categories overall are growing double digit. Of course, some of them are growing slower than others. In this quarter, we saw slower performance of gaming than what we had seen in the past, which was a combination of demand and some supply constraints that we were expecting, but we expect it to recover in Q4. So overall, very strong performance of the growth businesses that is really critical for us because this is -- they will continue to contribute to the overall growth of the Company even in a more relevant way going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Wamsi Mohan: Enrique, I was wondering if you might be willing to share some thoughts on the PC industry outlook overall for calendar '22? I think industry analysts are forecasting roughly 300 million. We heard one of your large competitors talk about a number that's lower. Our own work is showing something even lower than that. And any early thoughts into calendar '23, particularly as we stand here because there's a lot of concern about things reverting to sort of pre-COVID levels, given the dynamics that happened during COVID. And I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So, our current projection is similar to what you were describing. We see the market somewhere in between 290 million to 300 million units. This is what we are using for our plan. This is in June. We continue to see more growth from the premium categories. So from a revenue perspective, the market is proportionally bigger from that perspective. This is still significantly higher than what we -- than where we were pre COVID. And we think that the fundamentals of the business have not changed from the perspective that PCs are way more relevant now than they were three years ago. If you think about hybrid work, for example, which is where we think the majority of the companies are going to be working, if you think how majority of the companies are going to be working. If you think about telehealth, if you think about how students are using PCs today, all these are drivers of growth for PC. We see that the slowdown we are going through in consumer and potentially in commercial is driven by macro, is not driven by preferences for PCs or whether PCs are more useful or not. We continue to believe they are critical. And so, we remain optimistic about the future of PCs even if we think we are going to go through this temporary headwind driven by the macro situation.
Wamsi Mohan: Any thoughts on '23 there? And as a follow-up, can you talk about the state of the channel in terms of inventory? You clearly noted a more aggressive pricing environment. How worried should investors be about any potential write-downs that you might have to take? And do you expect the PC print profit mix to revert back to the 75%-25% as we look over the next few years?
Enrique Lores: So in terms of '23, at this stage, since we think that the major impact is macro, it's really hard to predict what is going to be the evolution on the macro side. And this is why we highlighted that we -- given that macro we cannot control, we are taking all the necessary actions in the Company to manage it through the next quarter because we think the difficult macro situation is going to continue. In terms of guide for fiscal year '23, we will be providing it at the end of -- during our Q4 call, and then this is the plan to share kind of how do we see the different businesses performing. And then in terms of channel, and these were like three follow-ups in the follow-up, we see, as I mentioned, high inventory in the channel. We are going to be managing it down through the different quarters, and we have this built into the guide that Marie shared with all of you.
Marie Myers: And what just said, so just a point of clarification on the inventory. So it's certainly on the PS side of the house that in Print hardware, actually, we're in good shape, given the current supply chain position. And also, just to add a comment to Enrique's comments about the PS profit mix and how to think about the rates, et cetera, I mean, we do expect, however, for PS to stay in those long-term ranges. So if you think about the acquisition of -- we just did here of Poly, I think that's a good example of how we see these growth businesses that have higher gross margins really playing into the mix going forward as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee: I guess if I can start with the PS segment. You've talked today about primarily the sort of consumer weakness that you're seeing, but you still expect the mix to sort of move towards the higher end there in terms of the high-end consumer, premium consumer remaining strong. I'm just wondering, what are you seeing in terms of price elasticity from consumers? Why shouldn't we sort of be a bit more concerned that maybe the next step is for consumers to start to trade down a bit and sort of the mixing to start to move down a bit? If you can share your thoughts around that and then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Yes. Let me share our view on that. What we are seeing in consumer is a shift towards more premium category because we think that the traditional buyer of the premium category is less impacted by the macro situation that we see. As inflation has grown, as energy prices have increased in many parts of the world, as food prices have increased, families with lower income, families with lower budgets have a bigger impact. And they usually or traditionally buy lower price PCs versus families with higher impact. And we think this is really one of the key drivers of the change of mix that we are seeing.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And a quick follow-up for Marie here. Marie, I'm just looking at the cash flow, updated cash flow guidance and the change in the cash flow seems a bit more pronounced than the change in the earnings outlook, particularly as if I walk through sort of the EPS changes on the share count. It just looks like the cash flow is coming down a lot more. If you can just walk me through the big sort of buckets in terms of the cash flow guidance change.
Marie Myers: Yes. No, we expect our cash flow is largely in line with our net earnings. Obviously, there's some differences quarter-to-quarter on working capital. But just in terms of how to think about cash flow and the guide and what we see as some of the drivers for Q4, firstly, I'd say, look, we've got plans to improve our working capital sequentially. And we're seeing that just in terms of the lower inventory levels. You would have seen that in Q3. We expect operationally to take additional actions going into Q4. I'd say we also, in this last quarter in Q3, we did have some timing impacts around other assets and higher accounts receivable from our contract manufacturers, which caused that AR to be collected in early Q4. This was caused by component receipts and delays to us. So therefore, those month three shipments to our CMs were late. Now we do also continue to expect to see some sequential improvement in PS volumes. As you know, PS is a negative cash conversion cycle so that will be a tailwind. So based on these factors, I'm confident in our free cash flow outlook of 3.5 to 4 for HP for the year.
Operator: Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Enrique, in your comments, you talked about sort of ASP declines becoming a bit stronger as you move through the quarter. And it also sounds like the commercial order slowing or sort of protracting is just on the front end. And so I guess the question is, should we anticipate the fundamentals become a bit more challenging post the [indiscernible] over quarter, if even just in the near term. And then I have a quick follow-up as well.
Enrique Lores: So we are not guiding next year. And we expect that channel inventory will be corrected or will be partially corrected at least during Q4. But as we entered in Q4, we expect this more aggressive pricing dynamics. When we look at the channel inventory of the industry, this is not an HP particular situation, channel inventories are high. And therefore, we expect to see competition be more aggressive on pricing. This is -- we are not going to be the drivers of that. We will only respond if we see the need to manage our sell-out. But we expect to see prices more -- pricing more aggressive as we enter in Q4.
Marie Myers: And another, just to add in the -- I'm just going to add that our chrome shipments fall off, so in terms of the compares, so that was a tailwind obviously for Q3, which won't be repeated in Q4.
Ananda Baruah: Helpful. And then a quick follow-up is the transformation plan that you're going to be talking to us about 90 days, would we be -- I'm just trying to get a sense of how incremental it is. And I guess the way I'll ask the question is, would we be hearing of you guys -- in 90 days, would you be describing to us some actions that you'd be taking or some plan if you weren't seeing the incremental macro impact currently?
Enrique Lores: Yes. I think what, in any case, no matter what the macro is, we need to continue to improve the efficiency of the Company. And the investments that we have done during the last years in IT and in digital systems will allow us to continue to do going forward. So what you will see from us is this plan that will show what are the investments that we are going to be making, what are the returns that we expect to see over time, but a big part of it is be driven by digital, leveraging from the work that has been done during the last years.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Enrique and Marie, when you mentioned about pricing and margins to kind of -- I'm sorry, margins to come down a little bit lower, I remember pre COVID, it was 3.5% to 5.5% operating margins for PS, and I think you took it from 5% to 7%. Are you kind of saying now we should kind of start to model in getting back to the 3.5% to 5.5% range? Or are you talking about kind of the lower end of the 5% to 7% range? I'm just kind of wondering about have we structurally moved higher or is it actually with more supply, going to go back to the 3.5% to 5.5% range?
Marie Myers: Jim, it's Marie. So we absolutely remain committed to our long-term ranges for PS that we gave at our Security Analyst Meeting. I think the point of clarification is just what we're expecting to see in Q4, where we do expect to be at the lower end of the range based on a lot of what you've heard on the call today. Plus also remember that Q4 is typically our consumer holiday season where you'll see obviously a slightly different mix from a pricing perspective. So overall, Jim, we're not changing our ranges and we're staying on track for our long-term range.
Enrique Lores: And just a reminder, Jim, what we said is we expected to see within the 5% to 7% range. We were already expecting margins for PC to go down as we shared that range. But we also were expecting the new businesses, peripherals and services, to grow in relevance to growing mix to compensate for the decline. These were the model that we had a year ago, continues to be the plan. We just need to see how this manages now as we face this new and unexpected economic headwind. Okay. So I think we are at the end of the time. Thank you all for joining us today and for spending the last hour with us. I would like to make a few comments. Clearly, during the quarter, even if we faced significant economic challenges, we delivered solid EPS growth of 4%, and we continue to return capital to shareholders, in this case, was $1.3 billion. We are taking clear actions to mitigate the near-term macro headwinds that we are facing while we continue to drive progress and execute on our long-term growth strategy. Because as we always say, this, as every other, is an opportunity to further strengthen the Company and to continue to build a stronger HP. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q2  (2022-05-31 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2022 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Josh and I’ll be your conference moderator for today’s call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session toward the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Orit Keinan-Nahon: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP’s second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP’s Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is a webcast, and a replay will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the earnings release and accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations webpage at investor.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP’s SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP’s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2022 and HP’s other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we’ve included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today’s earning release for those reconciliations. With that, I’d now like to turn the call over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thanks, Orit, and thank you to everyone joining our call today. We are now halfway for our 2022 fiscal year, and I am proud of the results our teams have delivered as we continue building a stronger HP. But before I talk about our performance, I want to acknowledge the tragic events of the past few weeks. Last Tuesday, 19 children and two of their teachers were senselessly killed at a Texas elementary school. About a week earlier, 10 people were killed in a racially motivated attack in Buffalo. These horrific events and others like them are deeply disturbing and our hearts are with the communities who are bearing unimaginable loss right now. At the same time, we're also thinking about the people of Ukraine. More than three months into the war with Russia, the devastation and suffering across Ukraine is difficult to comprehend. So too is the situation facing the six million Ukrainian refugees. We continue to mobilize resources to support them. The HP Foundation has provided additional funding to support humanitarian relief across Central Europe. And we are donating a significant number of PCs to help refugees and their families, consistent with our global efforts to promote digital equity and education. Times like this are a painful reminder of how much work is still needed to create a more just future. And I believe it's incumbent upon companies to lead with purpose. These values have long been core to HP brand, and they will continue to guide us. Let me now turn to our results. When we held our Investor Day last October, I discussed our plans to continue our push to advance our leadership in our core markets, while creating a more growth-oriented portfolio by expanding its adjacencies and creating new businesses. I also highlighted the long-term secular trends we see propelling us forward, especially the rise of hybrid work and the exciting opportunities it creates across our broad portfolio. Our second quarter results show strong momentum in each of these areas. In the face of a volatile and dynamic macro environment, we executed well and grew revenue and non-GAAP EPS while returning capital to our shareholders. We are delivering on our commitment and our business is well positioned for sustainable long-term growth. For the quarter, revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $16.5 billion as we continue to see strong demand for HP technology and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew 16% year-over-year to $1.08. That's at the high end of our previously provided outlook. We generated $0.4 billion of free cash flow, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We remain committed to building a more growth-oriented portfolio. Our key growth businesses, which includes gaming, peripherals, Instant Ink, Workforce Solutions and Industrial Graphics and 3D collectively grew double-digits and delivered total revenue of $5.6 billion in the first half of fiscal 2022 and we are well on track to deliver on our $10 billion full year revenue target that we announced last October. We feel very good about these results. We mitigated the impact of higher commodity costs by implementing effective pricing strategies in both Print and Personal Systems while maintaining strong demand. And as we navigate the macro environment, we are making consistent progress on our strategic priorities and bringing strong innovation to market. This is reflected in our business unit performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 9% to $11.5 billion. This was our highest Q2 revenue ever, reflecting the durability of PC demand. We also delivered operating profit margin of 6.9% at the high-end of our target range. We are managing our PS portfolio with great discipline focused on driving profitable revenue growth more than units. Our continued mix shift towards commercial and premium combined with our pricing strategy allowed us to more than offset fewer unit shipments in the quarter. Increased spending on hybrid work solutions is driving strong commercial PC demand. Commercial revenue grew 18% driven by double-digit growth in Windows-based notebooks, desktops and workstations. And commercial was trending up to 65% of our peer revenue mix in the quarter. In Consumer, while the market has seen some signs of softening demand, it still exceeded pre-pandemic levels. There are pockets of growth in areas like premium and gaming that we are most focused on. And we are driving continued growth in peripherals, which grew more than 40% this quarter. Our supply chain actions also continue to have a positive impact. We reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter. While the backlog remains elevated, particularly in commercial, we believe the actions we are taking will drive continued improvement. And as we prioritize operational execution, we are equally focused on strengthening our portfolio. During the quarter, we entered into an agreement to acquire Poly. Once completed, we expect this transaction will strengthen our position in hybrid work solutions and accelerate our growth in peripheral and workforce solutions. Since the announcement was made, we have received very positive feedback from reseller partners and commercial customers about the opportunity ahead. Our integration planning efforts are well underway. And we are working closely with the Poly team to prepare for a smooth transition upon deal close. We look forward to welcoming the Poly team into HP later this year. Turning to Print, we continue to operate in a components and logistics constrained environment, and performance was also impacted by the macro events this quarter. As a result, Print revenue declined 7% in the quarter, and our order backlog remained elevated in Q2. We expect supply chain dynamics to improve but continued shortages, especially in application-specific integrated circuit will impact print for the remainder of the year. We are actively working with our partners to mitigate the risks by executing on dual sourcing whenever possible and redesigning safety boards and components in our printers. We are also managing prices with great discipline, and we delivered another quarter of solid profitability. Our Print operating profit margin was 19.3%, our second consecutive quarter above our target range. Print consumer demand remained solid despite some softening in Europe. And we made important progress on two strategic objectives rebalancing system profitability and growing our subscription business. We have seen strong acceleration with HP plan and increased adoption in developed markets since launching last spring. In addition, we see strong growth on our profit upfront units, including our big tank model, especially in emerging markets. Big Tank revenue and units grew double digits year-over-year. We plan to continue expanding the Big Tank portfolio with new product launches of high-end platforms in the rest of our markets. Overall, HD+ and Big Tank printers have become a larger portion of our portfolio mix, representing 48% of printer shipments in the quarter. In consumer subscriptions, Instant Ink delivered another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue and cumulative subscribers. In commercial print, the Office segment continued to be impacted by supply availability as well as uncertainty around the timing of offices reopening. This was partially offset by our industrial graphics and 3D business growth. In Industrial Graphics, we delivered solid revenue growth and build a strong funnel continuing the positive trajectory we have seen in recent quarters. We had significant new installations of our latest Indigo digital presence. And I am particularly proud of the team's work for our customer, Hershey, as we created customized packaging to support their International Women's month campaign. We also delivered double-digit revenue growth in 3D printing. This quarter we announced a partnership with Legor Group, a leader in metals science and production for the luxury jewelry and fashion accessories market. This is an important milestone as we prepare to make metal yet more broadly available later this year. The progress we made in our first half of 2022 gives us confidence to raise our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook. And as we enter the second half, we will remain focused on disciplined execution in today's challenging and volatile macro environment. From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong commercial demand with some softening of the consumer businesses. From a supply perspective, we see two quarters of constraints. First is the industry-wide component shortages that we expect will continue through fiscal 2022; second, are the COVID-related disruptions in China, which we expect will primarily impact fiscal Q3. We will also see an impact from the Russia-Ukraine war. Last February, we suspended shipments to Russia and Belarus across our portfolio and post our marketing and advertising activities. Considering the COVID environment and long-term outlook for Russia, we have decided to stop our Russia activity and have become the process of fully winding down our operations. Business there accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2021. Marie will talk more about the financial aspects of our Russia plans. We remain committed to taking structural costs out of the business, and we are on track to meet our transformation cost targets. These actions combined with top line growth and effective working capital management give us confidence in achieving our free cash flow target. And we remain committed to our share repurchase plan of at least $4 billion in fiscal year 2022. The final point I'd like to make is that we are delivering on our financial commitments, while making progress against our sustainable impact strategy. Later this week, we will release our annual Sustainable Impact Report, outlining progress against climate action, human rights and digital equity goals. Let me give you a few examples. From 2019 to 2021, we achieved a 9% absolute reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions across HP's value chain. I am proud that we continue to decrease absolute emissions, while our net revenue increased by 8% during the same period. We have reduced single-use plastic packaging by 44% compared to 2018. And we have enabled better learning outcomes for over 74 million people globally since 2015 by providing curriculum, training and technology. I am inspired by the progress we are making toward becoming the world’s most sustainable and just technology company. Not only are these the right things to do, they are also differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business. To sum up, this quarter caps off a strong first half of 2022. We are building a more growth-oriented portfolio, while also operating with great discipline and agility in the face of macro challenges. The environment will remain dynamic in the second half. We are not immune to these challenges, but our strong performance and momentum through the first two quarters gives us confidence to increase our full year non-GAAP EPS outlook. We are equally confident in our free cash flow outlook for the year, and we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and continuing to return capital to shareholders, while investing in the business to build a stronger HP. I will stop here and let Marie provide a closer look into our financial and outlook.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It's great to connect with you again. As Enrique highlighted, we have continued to build on our progress here in Q2, executing on our strategy, delivering solid results, returning significant capital to shareholders and investing both organically and inorganically to drive long-term value creation. Overall demand remained solid, driven by the strong secular tailwinds we see propelling our businesses forward, and we continue to execute on our objectives despite ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges and new macro impacts from the recent round of COVID-related lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war. Overall, I am pleased with how our teams are meeting these challenges head on and remain confident in our execution, as we navigate this evolving macro environment. Let's take a closer look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $16.5 billion in the quarter, up 4% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 1%, EMEA increased 7% and APJ increased 10%. Gross margin was 20.2% in the quarter, down 1.5 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by proportionally higher Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities, partially offset by favorable pricing net of currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.4% of revenue, down 5%. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily driven by lower R&D due to last years ramp-up in investments and lower variable compensation, including sales commission. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.4 billion, and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $74 million for the quarter. At the key segment level, operating profit grew 6%. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.15 or 16% to $1.08 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $152 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits, as a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.94. Now let's turn to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems revenue was $11.5 billion, up 9% and up 11% in constant currency. Total units were down 17%, driven by ongoing supply chain challenges, lower per unit and the overall macro environment. Despite this, we grew revenue, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, our mix shift towards higher-value commercial categories like mainstream premium and mobile workstation and favorable pricing. Furthermore, to highlight some of the secular tailwinds we have seen in Personal Systems versus pre-pandemic our commercial notebook mix, excluding Chrome, now represents over 60% of our commercial unit mix, up 15 points versus Q2 2019. And in gaming, revenue has grown by over 140% versus Q2 2019. These are significant structural changes in our business. Drilling into the details, Commercial revenue was up 18% year-on-year and consumer revenue was down 6% year-on-year. By product category, revenue was up 3% for notebooks, 28% for desktops and 21% for workstations. We also continue to see strong performance across our key growth areas; including peripherals, gaming and workforce solutions with even more opportunities to drive growth ahead of us. Personal Systems delivered almost $800 million of operating profit with operating margins of 6.9%. Our Personal Systems business has grown operating profit dollars in 17 of the last 18 quarters. This consistent performance is indicative of our strong portfolio, the strong secular tailwinds we continue to see and our ability to deliver results in very different environments. Operating margin improved 0.2 points, primarily due to product mix, favorable pricing and lower OpEx including lower R&D spend due to last years investments ramp-up, partially offset by higher commodity costs in currency. Sequentially, operating margin declined 0.9 points, driven by higher OpEx due to R&D investment, more competitive pricing in several segments of consumer, partially offset by lower commodity and logistics costs. In print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the current environment. In Q2, total print revenue was $5 billion, down 7% and down 6% in constant currency, driven by lower print hardware units and lower supplies revenue. This was partially offset by higher hardware ASPs and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 23%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend at least through 2022. By customer segment, Commercial revenue declined 4% on a decrease of 17% in units and Consumer revenue was down 12% with units down 24%. Home Print demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by available supply. In Q2, the commercial recovery, particularly in the office segment, continued to be impacted by the slower-than-expected return to the office. We did see, however, solid growth in industrial graphics and 3D as Enrique mentioned. We continue to expect a gradual and uneven recovery in Commercial over time, with the overall office market returning to approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic TAM, as we have discussed previously. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 6% in constant currency year-on-year. We continue to expect for FY 2022 and over the long-term, Supplies will decline in the mid- to low single-digit range, consistent with the outlook provided at our Analyst Day. In Q2, the decline was driven primarily by continued normalization in home printing as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in both office and industrial print. Supplies revenue was also impacted by the China lockdowns and the Russia-Ukraine war. Adjusting for these impacts, supplies revenue was down approximately 4% in constant currency. As part of our contractual business, our Instant Ink services continued its momentum, once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth and revenue, while monthly churn continues to remain low at approximately 1%. Operating profit was approximately $1 billion, up $7 billion and operating margin was strong at 19.3%. Operating margin increased 1.4 points, driven by favorable mix and pricing, combined with lower OpEx as a result of lower variable compensation, including sales commissions, partially offset by lower volumes. Now, let's move to our transformation efforts where we have made strong progress and are on track to deliver $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions by year-end. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. For our sales teams and partners, we have accelerated the selling cycle by transforming the way we configure price and quote HP Solutions for our customers worldwide. Utilizing advanced analytical pricing capabilities with a cloud-based platform, we have enabled the delivery of competitive quotes for HP Solutions in a quarter of the time, delivering a faster and more efficient customer sales experience. Lastly, we continue to optimize our real estate footprint, including 15 real estate actions in the first half of 2022. We are rebuilding and modernizing our key locations, focusing on collaboration hybrid work for our employees. A great example of this is our accelerated actions in Korea to both consolidate our sites and open a new state-of-the-art office and R&D facility, bringing together most of our employees in Korea. Now, let's move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations and free cash flow was $0.5 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 26 days in the quarter, a sequential decline of seven days. So free cash flow and the sequential decline in cash conversion days were driven primarily by the decrease in Personal Systems volume and back-end loaded revenue linearity, driven by supply chain delays. Looking ahead to the second half of 2022, we expect to improve our cash conversion cycle by fiscal year-end. Driving our outlook is our expectations for Personal Systems volumes to recover in Q4, which I will provide more color on in a moment. And other operational improvements in our cash conversion cycle, including reduced inventory. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our free cash flow guidance of at least $4.5 billion for 2022. Strong capital returns remain a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q2, we returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders. This included approximately $1 billion in share repurchases and $262 million in cash dividends, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target by year-end. Looking forward to Q3 and the rest of FY 2022, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, inflation, pricing dynamics and the evolving macro environment, while continuing to deliver on our commitments. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q3 and overall financial outlook. We are once again raising our full year non-GAAP outlook for FY 2022 as we navigate through a challenging macro environment. We expect currency to be about a 2% year-over-year headwind in both Q3 and for FY 2022, reflecting the recent strength of the US dollar. With regard to the financial impact of the Russia-Ukraine war and the recent lockdowns in China, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that conditions remain fluid and highly uncertain, with impacts to our top and bottom line results. Regarding Russia, as Enrique mentioned, we have made the decision to stop our activity there and have begun the process of fully winding down our operations. At FY 2021, Russia accounted for approximately $1 billion in revenue. In China, we expect to see a reopening and easing of restrictions from the recent lockdowns beginning in June. For Personal Systems, we continue to see solid demand and pricing for our PCs in commercial with some softening of demand in consumer, driven in part by the macro factors I mentioned earlier, including currency. We expect year-over-year Personal Systems revenue growth through the second half of 2022 with a continued shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. With regard to our Personal Systems supply chain, while we expect to see a gradual improvement in the supply environment, we did experience a supplier-specific disruption late in Q2. That we expect will resolve by the end of Q3, resulting in a sequential decline in Personal Systems revenue in Q3 and a rebound in Q4, more in keeping with typical seasonality. We expect PS margins to remain near the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q3. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022. With regard to print supply chain, we expect similar to Q2, composed shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these conditions to continue at least through 2022, but with some improvement into the latter part of the year. We expect group margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY 2022. For Q3 specifically, given continued hard work constraints, we expect print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.08. And third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.91 to $0.96, which includes an incremental GAAP-only charge of approximately $0.04 related to the wind down of operations in Russia. We expect FY 2022 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.24 to $4.38. And FY 2022, GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.93. For FY 2022, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. We have made excellent progress against our priorities in the first half of fiscal 2022. And I am confident in our ability to continue to deliver on our second half outlook while investing the long-term sustainable growth. I'll stop here so we can take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will be from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong results and execution in a tough environment. My first question is for Enrique, and then I have a follow-up for Marie. Enrique, on the PC business, it makes sense, commercial is strong. But it looks like desktop did much better than notebooks, both in terms of revenue and units. Can you just help us understand what's happening in commercial between desktop and notebook? And any view on PC TAM, unit TAM for this year? Your competitors spoke about 330 million units, kind of curious what your view is. And then I have a quick follow-up for Marie on inventory. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you. Let me start with desktops and actually same happened with workstations. The growth this quarter is really helped from an easy compare last year. If you remember last year, not many companies were investing in equipment for the office. This drove the sales of desktops and workstations down. And now we are seeing the opposite effect as some of this investment is coming back. I think on the overall PC market, the important thing to have in mind is the strength of the demand on the commercial side. We are seeing this across the board, across all geographies, and this is especially true on high configurations given the new use models that PCs are going to have. And this is why even if for the year, going now to the second part of your question, we expect the overall PC market in terms of units to decline slightly. This is very similar to what other analysts and other companies have shared. From a revenue perspective, we see growth really driven by mix as commercial will become bigger, premium categories within commercial will be bigger. And also as premium consumer and gaming will become a more relevant part of the market.
Krish Sankar: Got it, Enrique. Follow-up for Marie on inventory. Last quarter, you said you're not planning to decrease inventory, and it's kind of elevated in terms of inventory days. Can you give us some color on how much of it is finished goods or raw materials and components? How much of it is actually buildup of materials versus cost inflation? Any kind of color on inventory would be very helpful. Thank you very much
Marie Myers: Sure, and good afternoon, Christian, and thanks for your question. So from a sequential perspective, our inventory actually declined, and that was due to in-transit offset by higher commodity costs due to supply constraints. Now in terms of both print and PS, a couple of different dynamics. So let me give you some color. So -- on the Print side, it's really driven by the assurance of supply, given the ongoing supply constraints that we're seeing on the print side and also just the longer lead and transit times. And then in PS, what's going on there is really the shift in motor transport. So -- as you might recall, I think we made this comment in our last call that we stopped using the train that we have used extensively from China to Europe, and we shifted a lot more of PS onto the ocean we've seen that shift from air to ocean. So that's what you're seeing. And then obviously, sea shipments are really for economic value and really drive much better pass-through, a lot better cost for us. So that's hopefully the perspective on inventory for you.
Enrique Lores: We have said in the past, our medium-term plan is to continue to reduce own inventory. We think we have an opportunity there. And with the component situation getting better, we really think that this is going to be our plan during the next quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on the good execution in the quarter. Two questions, one and one follow-up. First, I'm just curious, Enrique and Maria, if you could kind of dive a little bit deeper into the commercial backlog in the PC segment. What's your expectations of working that backlog down? Is your guidance assuming that you continue to have an elevated backlog? Any kind of commentary on how we should think about the trajectory of that backlog through the back half of this fiscal year.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So thank you. So as we said in the prepared remarks, commercial backlog, commercial PC backlog and especially commercial continues to be elevated. Our plan is to reduce that during the coming quarters, and we will continue to improve the situation from a supply chain perspective. And by the end of the year or early next year, should be -- we should be done with that.
Aaron Rakers: Yes Okay. That's helpful. And then the follow-up question is just looking at the pricing trends you're seeing within PSG. Could you help us appreciate how much of it is being mix driven versus your ability to pass through increased pricing from components and logistics? I'm just curious if you can help us understand the effects of pricing.
Marie Myers: Yes. No, I'd say, first of all, we definitely benefited from favorable pricing. And I think we've made those comments over the last couple of quarters. And really, it's due to that supply and demand imbalance that we've been experiencing. And I'd say particularly on the PS side, we've been able to actually pass-through a lot of that inflationary pricing straight through into our products. Now, I would just add, if the supply and demand starts to come back into closer alignment, we'll start to see some of that pricing normalize. But right now, in terms of just the current outlook, we really expect pricing to remain strong in the second half of the year.
Enrique Lores: And in terms of your comment about mix, mix has also a significant impact on pricing. And really, when we -- you need to think about mix, you need to think about the new use models for PCs. PCs are more-and-more used as communication tools, which means customers need more memory, better cameras, better audio. And this is really driving demand towards the richer categories and the more premium products and is really having a significant impact on the overall price -- on pricing.
Marie Myers: Yeah. I should add. Just on the mix comment actually, this quarter, around 65% of our PS portfolio is commercial, which obviously, as you know, has higher ASPs. So it's a combination of both, the mix and the rate, which is really driving that favorability in pricing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on a good quarter. Mine as well I guess I have two as well. The first one is, just on the Print side, and I think your operating margin performance there was really impressive in the April quarter. So, maybe you could just talk about, what is enabling this really strong 19% plus operating margin performance in April, despite the supply [Indiscernible] that you had? And then, as you think about the back half, it doesn't seem like mix is getting any different versus what you have in April. So, why would margins dip down based on what you said, on the Print side?
Enrique Lores: Yeah. So the performance of the Print business this quarter was really driven by supply. We continue to see demand significantly above supply. And in supply, we are impacted mostly by component availability. And therefore, our focus was on really profit optimization through pricing, through allocation of units. And this is why profitability this quarter was so strong. As we shared before, we expect the supply situation to improve through the end of the year. And as we -- this will happen we also expect that pricing will be normalized, as Marie just explained.
Marie Myers: Yeah. Maybe I'll just add some comments then on Q3 on the print rate and what we expect to happen. As we've said, we expect for the full year that would be at the high-end of that range. And in fact actually what we're expecting in Q3 it actually would be slightly above that. And really what that's driven by is a combination of the supply constraints that Enrique spoke about, some of the mix that we're starting to see as the office reopens. And then, given that backdrop, we're still seeing the impact of that favorable pricing, I just spoke about a moment ago, so we'll expect some of that to come through. And obviously, we're doing all of that, while we're offsetting currency headwinds as well. So overall, we would expect the rate for Print to certainly in the year be at the high-end of that long-term range.
Amit Daryanani: Understood. And then, if I could just ask you around the non-GAAP adjustments that are being made for the fiscal 2022 guide. I understand you're raising the non-GAAP numbers, but the GAAP numbers that are coming down. So I think the adjustments are $0.45 this time, 90 days ago, that was $0.31. Maybe I don't understand this enough, but could you just talk about what is resulting or what are the incremental adjustments that are being made? Is it restructuring? Is it Russia? And if you could just break that down, that would be helpful.
Marie Myers: Sure, happy to do so. So, we actually revised our FY 2022 GAAP guidance. And we actually have $0.11 just to clarify at the midpoint. So let me walk you through these really four key items that are driving it, which you captured a couple in your comments. So first of all, with the acquisition-related charges, related to Poly. As you know, we announced that just a little while ago, so that wasn't included in our prior GAAP guidance. Secondly, there are charges with Russia, which we actually -- I spoke about I think in my prepared remarks. And then we also have the timing acceleration of some real estate actions related to our transformation. And then finally, we've got some onetime related tax adjustments as well. So that's basically the construct for the revised GAAP guide.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. I have two as well. I just want to understand the backlog dynamics that happened in the quarter and what you're expecting going forward. So, I think you said you drew down backlog in PCs was book-to-bill and revenues positive in the quarter? Can you give us some sense of how much backlog drawdown there was in PCs? And was there any backlog drawdown in printing? And when we think about the remainder of the year, if there's a supplier disruption in PCs, why would you expect to be able to continue to draw down backlog in Q3? And I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So, as I commented before, Toni, we saw a reduction of backlog Q2 -- Q1 to Q2, visibly driven by the ability to ship some of the units at the -- and increase some of the volumes in some specific areas. As we look out through the end of the year, we expect the supply situation to improve, and therefore, we expect to continue to reduce backlog in the rest of the year. In the case of print, we continue to operate also with a high level of backlog. The reduction there was smaller. And we expect that we will be able to start reducing that more significantly in the Q4 timeframe, which is where we have visibility of some of the actions we have taken in supply chain to take more impact.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Thank you. But I'm still not quite clear why, if you have a supplier constraint and you're expecting lower revenues in Q3 from PCs, why you think you'll draw down backlog? And can I also just get you to clarify typically, seasonally, Printing is down Q2 to Q3. I think you're saying PCs will be down Q2 to Q3. Is that what we should expect? And again, if we -- if you're drawing down backlog, that feels a lot lower. Typically, you're up 4% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So again, I'm just trying to square the circle with your anticipated backlog drawdowns and the dynamics of having weaker than seasonal PC revenues in Q3? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So, the comment about growing backlog is more a second half quarter – a second half comment. Specifically, in Q3 we have identified a very specific problem with one of our PC component supplier that is, having some special issues on yield in one other factory. This is going to be impacting our shipments in Q3 for PC. We have line of sight for this to be recovered in Q4. And this is why from a seasonality perspective, revenue in Personal Systems in PC in Q3 will be below Q2. And again, the backlog coming in a second half comment, not a quarter-over-quarter comment. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Erik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you for the quarter -- excuse me, thank you for the question. Congrats on the quarter. If we take a step back, it's been a pretty unique time in the market, kind of the best PC growth in the decade plus short supply, which has allowed you to hold pricing. And then, at the same time, you've been able to work through a multiyear cost-cutting kind of transformation program, and it's clearly showing up in your margin profile, right, pre-kind of COVID period operating margins were around 7% to 7.5%. Right now, they're running around 9% consistently. So, just curious kind of -- is there a way that you can break down the margin uplift between kind of mix and kind of the permanency of the changes that you've made versus temporary factors like pricing that you expect to potentially normalize in the back half of the year and into next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Probably the best way to answer, Erik, is to go back to the guidance we provided in our Investor Day in October, where we share, what is our perspective for both businesses. In the case of Personal Systems, we expect margins to be between 5% and 7% going forward. We raised that in October from what we had before to reflect, especially the impact of the cost activities that we have put in place, and also the focus that we had in higher margin categories. And I like to remind you that several of our growth areas like gaming, peripheral and services in the case of PC will help us to sustain these higher margins. In the case of print, our margins -- our projection is that margins will stay in the 16% to 18% range. And again, our long-term strategy is really focused on those categories where we think we can drive both growth and sustainable margins. While at the same time, we expect that some of the pricing benefits we have experienced during the last two years will fade over time.
Erik Woodring: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Enrique. And then maybe a question on Print. Go back to SAM 2019, you laid out this business model pivot for the printing business to collect more profits upfront from the sale of printing hardware, while at the same time introducing programs like HP+ to make supplies stickier in certain situations. So, we're now more than two years away from that announcement. Can you just kind of give us an update on where we are on this pivot? How much is left to do, kind of what inning we're in? And then, really how a normalization and kind of supply and demand and pricing dynamics could change or alter your ability to kind of capture some of these higher hardware prices that you've been able to do over the last, call it, two years and change. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you. We are very pleased with the program that we are doing in the pivot of the business model. We shared today that today, in Q2, around 48% of the units are either what we call profit upfront, so customers get a printer and the ink or toner when they get the unit or HP+ unit. So this gives you an idea of the progress that we have made in the last two years, and we expect this percentage to continue to increase as the adoption for HP plants will continue to grow. Another important element of our strategy is the growth of our subscription model. And also, we shared today that in Q2 that business both from subscribers and from a revenue perspective, we grew double digit. So this also shows the momentum that we have in that part of the company.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you. I have some pretty easy specific questions, one for Enrique and one for Marie. Enrique, I believe it was a year ago, you highlighted the strength in Chromebook's from HP. Now will we -- can you help us kind of quantify how much exposure you have to PC because now the world, of course, is opposite of the view of strength for Chromebook's. Just want to see the risk there? And then for Marie, is the reason why we're not increasing free cash flow is that as a function of those four items that you mentioned on the adjustments of the Russia, the closing costs, non-GAAP tax adjustments and things like that? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. Thank you, Jim. So the exposure -- the size of the overall Chromebook business is relatively small in our Personal Systems business. It lends 10% from a revenue perspective and much smaller from an operating profit or margin perspective. So the exposure that we have is relatively small. Shipments of Chromebook this quarter were also small. So this shows that we can really perform in a very strong way of Personal Systems even in there, we have very small Chromebook market. What we have seen during this year, and we started to see it a few quarters ago, and we have talked about this before is a significant slowdown of the Chromebook business in the US in the education segment, we are starting to see some signs of recovery, but the market has continued to be significantly below where it was a year ago.
Marie Myers: Jim, good morning. Just on your comments on free cash flow, just to clarify. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect to generate at least $4.5 billion in free cash flow this year. So we remain very much on track. And with respect to the items that I explained on the GAAP guide in terms of their impact on cash flow, the impacts that we had in the quarter were really much more related to PS volumes in the back-end loaded revenue linearity. As you heard Enrique say earlier, we expect that to course correct in Q4. So at this point, we expect our cash flow to remain on track for our guide.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Ananda Baruah: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon guys. Congrats on the results and strong execution in an increasingly challenging environment. Two, if I could, have you guys seen any impact to any of your commercial business for macro? And are you getting any feedback yet if you've not seen any impact yet, are you getting any feedback yet from customers about what they're thinking? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Ananda. So the answer is not yet. We haven't -- we continue to see strong demand on the commercial side. We have a strong funnel. So we don't see any signals of weakening of the demand on the commercial side. And this is one of the key drivers of the guide that we have provided for the rest of the year.
Ananda Baruah: Enrique, that's really helpful. And then, Enrique, just moving over to the PC business quickly. How much -- I believe that 90 days ago, sort of, 90 days ago, 180 days ago, you guys are thinking that the market, PC market would be up flat to slightly up for the year. So now sounds like slightly down for the year. Is that accurate by recollection? And if it is, is the change -- how much is supply chain related coming out of China with the lockdown? And how much of it is demand related? And then the second part to that is you gave us your view on the market. How are you expecting HP to perform unit-wise this year as well? Thanks. And that’s it for me.
Enrique Lores: Yeah. So two things. One is, from a unit perspective, we expect this year to see a small decline from where the market was in 2021, but to stay at a very elevated level compared to 2019. In terms of units, we expect the market to be in the 320 million, 330 million units in line with what many of the analysts and other companies have published. From a revenue perspective, though, we expect to see growth. We expect the market to grow in the 3% to 4%, really driven by many of the things we have been discussing today, mix between consumer and commercial and a mixed shift towards more premium units in both segments. And that's really what is driving the growth that we expect to see in Personal Systems through the rest of the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Your line is open.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you. I have two quick questions, one for Enrique and then a quick follow-up for Marie. So Enrique, you -- both you and your competitors have noted that you're focused on higher-end PCs, including commercial, gaming and high-end consumer as a reason for sustainable growth and better ASPs and mix going forward. But I guess the question I have is the supply chains have started the typical buying pattern and the pricing backdrop how do we know that there is not risk to incremental buyers of PCs coming online when supply normalizes targeting more low-end devices, lower spec PCs give that there might have been some people lining up early in the queue for more richer configurations? And then I have a follow-up for Marie on margins.
Enrique Lores: Well, I think the demand of both is fairly independent. We -- because of -- as I mentioned before, because of US model in commercial consumer customers need higher and better configurations because of a growth in gaming we see growth in that category, which in general has also higher average selling prices and this is driving the demand of this category. We continue to have a very strong glowing portfolio and if we see more demand on that side, we will be happy to serve it, but at this point, we really see demand on the more premium categories both in commercial and in consumer.
David Vogt: Great. And then a quick follow up from Marie. Marie, thanks for all the color on the margin. Just to follow-up on margin. So you're well above your 16% to 18% range, not only this quarter but in the prior quarter, and then the guide for the third quarter. But if I just sort of analyze the full year guidance, are you intimating that by Q4 of this fiscal year, print margins return back towards the lower end of your long-term range? I'm doing the math correctly and if so is that sort of the way to think about the profitability of that segment going forward that this is sort of a onetime above the range period and that 16% to 18% is more likely the stable environment that we're going to be operating in for the foreseeable future?
Marie Myers: Yes. No, David. Good afternoon. So I think the way to think about it for the full year is really that we expect to be at the high-end. As I mentioned a bit earlier, we expect it to be above for Q3 due to the supply chain constraints. But overall, just to kind of give you a little extra context here, we've seen that favorable pricing impact, and we believe the durability around that is there, plus you've seen us very successfully managed through the headwinds in the business, whether that was currency, with commodities, et cetera. And then Enrique talked today about the growth businesses and how we're driving that in terms of just the flow-through factor for a longer-term perspective. So that's the right way to think about our margin construct going forward. It's a combination of all of those factors coming together. But for the year, I really want you to leave with the thought that we're going to be at the high end of 2016 to 2018.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Marie, and thank you, everybody, for your questions today and for joining the call. I think the first six months of fiscal year 2022 show that our business continues to perform well and that we are entering the second half from a position of strength. I want to especially highlight the performance that we have had in our growth businesses. As I said at the beginning of the call, they represented $5.6 billion of business, well on track to deliver on the $10 billion goal that we shared with all of you in October. At the same time, we really show this gives us strong confidence as we enter in the second half. This is why we decided to raise our EPS guide for the year to reflect that confidence and we are really well positioned to deliver sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow. So really, thank you for joining today and looking forward to continue to speak to all of you soon. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2022 Q1  (2022-02-28 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2022 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Betsy, and I’ll be your conference moderator for today’s call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Orit Keinan-Nahon, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Enrique Lores: Thanks, Orit, and thank you all for joining today’s call. Before I discuss the quarter, I want to briefly address the unfolding situation in Ukraine. The well-being of our people, their families and our customers and partners is our top concern. We are doing everything we can to keep them safe. We want nothing more than to see peace and stability restored to the region. We have an experienced cross-functional team in place focused on business continuity. The environment is very fluid and we are preparing for a range of scenarios. And in the meantime, in compliance with administration’s recently approved sanctions, we have suspended shipments to Russia. The difficult situation in Ukraine is the latest in a series of global challenges we have faced. Time and again, our team has shown remarkable agility and determination, and I have great confidence in their ability to manage these situations. When we were last together at the end of 2021, I talked about our strategy to modernize our core, expand into valuable adjacencies and build a more growth-oriented portfolio. And our first quarter results show the progress we are making against this plan. We continue to see very strong demand, driven in large part by the secular tailwinds associated with hybrid. The way people work and live have fundamentally changed, and we see this trend continuing across our segments long past the pandemic. This creates incredible opportunities for innovation and growth. Companies are reconfiguring office space to be more collaborative, and this is requiring a refresh in their IT strategies, services and security offerings. Consumers are investing to improve their home office setups as hybrid work becomes the norm. And when they are not working, people are looking for more immersive entertainment experience with improved video, audio and battery performance. Underlying all these is a growing desire from both consumers and commercial customers to buy from companies with well-developed ESG goals. Each of these trends play to our strength and they drove our Q1 results. We grew revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow, continuing our track record of meeting or exceeding our commitments. Let me walk through the details. For the quarter, revenue grew 9% to $17 billion. This is our highest-ever quarterly revenue since separation, driven by demand for our products and services. Non-GAAP EPS grew more than twice as fast as revenue, up 20% to $1.10, and we generated $1.4 billion of free cash flow while returning 127% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our results were particularly strong in the key growth areas that I outlined last year. Collectively, these businesses grew double digits this quarter. This includes more than 20% growth in gaming, more than 40% growth in peripheral and 20% growth for our industrial graphics and 3D portfolio. We are bullish in our opportunities in this area, and we expect them to become a larger part of our overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We delivered while continuing to navigate a complex environment of industry-wide component shortages and logistical constraints. Despite steady progress against our plans to strengthen our operational processes, it will take time before the gap between supply and demand fully dissipates. We are securing more parts for products, sourcing from alternate part suppliers and allocating available parts to optimize our product mix. This is an area of relentless focus for our team. Let me now talk about the progress we see across each of our business units. In Personal Systems, it was a record quarter with our highest revenue and operating profit since separation. Revenue grew 15% to more than $12 billion. We delivered OP rate above the high end of our target range, and our disciplined execution and pricing strategy enabled us to manage cost and component headwinds. A big contributor to our success is the improved mix we are driving. Our leadership in the commercial PC market is a significant competitive advantage as more and more offices reopen. This is where we saw the most demand and highest profitability. Within commercial, we saw strong growth in Windows-based notebooks and mobile workstations, where our share expanded this quarter. In consumer, we continue to experience demand shift into high-value categories like premium and gaming. We also reduced our backlog quarter-over-quarter and our supply chain actions are generating positive results. And as we prioritize operational execution, we continue to innovate at the heart of hybrid. Last month, we had our biggest Consumer Electronics Show ever, launching nearly 50 new innovations that are changing the way people collaborate, create and play. This included a major expansion of our portfolio of HP Presence-enabled devices as we strengthen our position in the large and growing video conferencing market. We also launched our latest gaming solutions and peripherals, including a new HyperX wireless headset that can last 300 hours on a single charge. Turning to Print, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain challenges. As a result of component shortages and logistics exceptions, revenue declined 4% in the quarter and our elevated order backlog increased sequentially. We now expect these dynamics to impact Print throughout March of fiscal year 2022. We are driving a very disciplined pricing and allocation strategy across Print, and our operating profit rate of 18.2% was above the high end of our target range. We are also making good progress against our long-term priorities. We continue to modernize core Print and drive HP+ global adoption. HP+ is a big selling point of our new ENVY Inspire lineup, which we successfully launched in the U.S. last year and roll out across Europe in Q1. And we are seeing strong demand for our commercial portfolio as companies plan for office reopenings. We are earning accolades for industry leadership in areas such as hybrid work, security and print sustainability. It was an outstanding quarter for our industrial printing businesses. In industrial graphics, we generated another quarter of double-digit revenue growth and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This illustrates the positive recovery trend from prior quarter. And we delivered significant year-over-year revenue growth in 3D printing. More than 120 million Multi Jet Fusion parts have been printed, and we are accelerating our strategy to create high-value end-to-end applications in vertical markets. Along these lines, we completed the acquisition of Choose Packaging. Choose has invented the world’s only commercially available zero-plastic paper bottle, and they are working with many global brands to commercialize their offerings, including large enterprises like Henkel. This acquisition complements our molded fiber solution and positions HP well in the $10 billion fiber-based sustainable packaging industry. There are more than 150 million tons of single-use plastics produced each year, and we intend to disrupt this market with fiber-based 100% plastic-free packaging. In fact, our focus on sustainability is driving innovation across our entire portfolio. In Personal Systems, we now have more than 300 products made using ocean bottle plastic. And in Print, we recently launched the most sustainable toner cartridge we have ever developed. This supports our broader ESG and sustainable impact strategy. The actions we are taking on climate, human rights and digital equity are differentiating our brand and helping to drive our business forward. In fact, our sustainable impact agenda helped us to win more than $3.5 billion in new sales in fiscal 2021. This is a threefold increase over the previous year, reflecting the power of our commitments. Our partners are also doubling down on sustainability. More than 10,000 channel partners across over 40 countries are now able to participate in HP Amplify impact, a first-of-its-kind partner program aligned with our sustainable impact strategy. It is a great example of how we are leveraging our global scale to help address some of society’s biggest challenges while also positioning our business for success. The progress we are making across our strategic priority is driving strong cash flow. And we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust return-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation strategy. We expect to continue to make organic and inorganic investments in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders, and we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year 2022. It was an excellent start to the year. We are delivering on our commitment and creating significant value for our shareholders. We are returning highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow growth as we build a stronger HP. Let me now turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q2 outlook. Marie, over to you.
Marie Myers: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. It’s great to connect with all of you again. I want to start where Enrique left off in terms of our performance in the quarter. It was a very strong start to the year. Demand for our technology, favorable trends such as hybrid and powerful innovation across our portfolio are driving long-term value creation. And you see this reflected in our Q1 results as we delivered across all of our key financial metrics, including growing revenue, operating profit and EPS. Let me give you a closer look at the details. Net revenue was $17 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 8% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 1%, EMEA increased 8% and APJ increased 28%. Demand remains strong, creating sustained tailwinds across our businesses. But as Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints remain a top line headwind for both Personal Systems and Print revenue. These dynamics were particularly impactful to our Print hardware results, which I will talk about in a moment. Gross margin was 19.9% in the quarter, down 1.3 points year-on-year. The decrease was primarily driven by increased Personal Systems mix and higher costs, including commodities and logistics, partially offset by pricing, including currency. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.1% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market, partially offset by lower Personal Systems R&D due to partner funding. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.5 billion, up 1.5% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.18 or 20% to $1.10, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $117 million, primarily related to: restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges and other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.99. Now let’s turn to segment performance. In Q1, Personal Systems revenue was $12.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year. Total units were down 6%, given the expected supply chain challenges, logistics delays and lower chrome mix. Despite this, we still grew revenue double digits, reflecting the strength of Windows demand, favorable pricing and our mix shift towards higher-value categories like mainstream and premium commercial. As an example, commercial PC Windows units were up over 20% year-on-year. Drilling into the details. Consumer revenue was down 1% and commercial was up 26%. By product category, revenue was up 14% for notebooks, 17% for desktops and 40% for workstations. We also continued to drive double-digit growth across peripherals, gaming and device as a service, each of which are part of what Enrique shared as our focus on creating a more growth-oriented portfolio. Personal Systems delivered almost $1 billion of operating profit with operating margins of 7.8%. Our margin improved 0.7 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including currency, product mix, operating expense mix and R&D funding, partially offset by higher commodity costs. In Print, our results reflected our focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigate the supply chain environment. In Q1, total Print revenue was $4.8 billion, down 4%, driven by lower print hardware units and lower supplies revenue. This was partially offset by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in industrial graphics and services. Total hardware units declined 28%, largely due to continued component and logistics constraints, which we now expect to extend into the second half of 2022. By customer segment, consumer revenue was down 23% with units down 31%. Commercial revenue grew 9% with units down 3%. demand remains solid. However, revenue across both home and office was again constrained by the current supply chain and logistics environment. The commercial recovery showed further progress, with hardware revenue growth and double-digit increases in both industrial graphics and large format. We expect to see a gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending through 2022. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, consistent with our outlook that we provided at our Analyst Day. The decline was driven primarily by further normalization in home printing, as expected, partially offset by the gradual recovery in commercial. We saw momentum in our contractual business, with Instant Ink once again delivering double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth in revenue. We also drove Managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with renewal TCV up double-digit. Print operating profit was $879 million, declining $119 million and operating margin was 18.2%. Operating margin decreased 1.6 points, driven primarily by a tough prior year compare and higher costs, including commodity and logistics costs. This was partially offset by pricing, including currency and improved performance in industrial graphics and 3D. Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we move into the third year of our cost savings program, we remain steadfast in our focus on delivering on our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our transformation continues to create new capabilities and long-term value creation. In Print, for example, we are modernizing our digital ecosystem by consolidating our software and firmware platforms. Our new architecture provides a digital ecosystem, allowing us to develop modern capabilities and services offerings to drive differentiated customer experiences via our HP Smart App. In addition, we are leveraging these digital ecosystem enhancements to streamline and scale our big data platform capabilities, allowing us to gain valuable real-time insights about our customers and business operations. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts are enabling these types of strategic growth drivers, and we see many more opportunities to drive business enablement through additional software, services and solutions offerings. Now let me move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow for operations and free cash flow was strong at $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. The cash conversion cycle was minus 33 days in the quarter. This improved eight days sequentially as higher days payable outstanding and lower days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the increase in days of inventory. Significant capital return remains a key part of our capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 127% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchases and $271 million in cash dividends. We expect to aggressively buy back shares of at least $4 billion in FY 2022, and we remain on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital targets. Looking forward to Q2 and the rest of FY 2022, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the overall macro environment. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q2 and overall financial outlook. We are raising our full year outlook for FY 2022 to reflect the strength of our Q1 results and expected strength of our Q2 performance. We expect currency to be about 1% year-over-year headwind for FY 2022. With regard to the financial impact of the unfolding situation in Ukraine, including the current sanctions on Russia, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that the situation remains fluid and highly uncertain. In Q2, we expect a negative impact to our top line and bottom line as a result of the sanctions that have been imposed. In total, net of mitigations, we have factored in a $0.02 to $0.03 EPS headwind to our Q2 guidance. For the second half of 2022, the broad ramifications of the situation in Europe and beyond are uncertain and we are monitoring this closely. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue through fiscal 2022 with a further shift towards higher-value categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. Specifically for Q2, we expect our top line results to be incrementally constrained by a volatile supply chain and logistics environment and also the dynamic macro environment, including the Russia situation, all negatively impacting our top line. In total, we expect a high single-digit decline quarter-on-quarter to Personal Systems revenue. We expect PS margins at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term range, particularly in Q2. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, favorable pricing, disciplined cost management and further normalization and mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022. With regard to Print supply chain, we expect similar to what we saw in Q1, component shortages and logistics delays to constrain revenue. We expect these supply chain constraints to continue into the second half of 2022. We now expect Print margins to be at the high end of our 16% to 18% range for FY 2022. For Q2 specifically, given the continued hardware constraints we are anticipating, we expect Print margin to be above our 16% to 18% range. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.08, and second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.01. We expect FY 2022 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.18 to $4.38, and FY 2022 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.87 to $4.07. For FY 2022, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. We are making excellent progress against our priorities, and I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent, long-term sustainable growth. I’ll stop here, so we can take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my questions. Given the importance of ASP growth in your revenue, can you help us to understand a little bit more about the dynamics behind what’s driving the increases, both in print and PCs? And what I’m thinking is how much of the growth is related to mix, like in PCs going to commercial from consumer and versus sort of how much are the price increases more on a like-for-like basis and they’re kind of positioned to offset inflation? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Marie Myers: Hey Shannon, good afternoon. How are you? I hope you’re doing well. So first of all, I’ll just start out by saying, look, we’ve continued to see the benefit from favorable pricing, as you mentioned, due to the dynamics around supply and demand imbalances. And with respect to how we see it to mix shifts, we’ve seen the impact of mix shifts year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter from consumer to commercial. As you heard in the – in our earnings announcement, we had a very strong performance on our revenue in commercial, particularly in PCs. So in PS and in Print hardware, that mix shift was actually what drove a lot of the strength that you’ve seen in ASPs.
Shannon Cross: Was some of it inflation, though, or…?
Marie Myers: Well, actually, we have been pricing - I think one of the benefits we’ve seen in the quarter is the impact of favorable pricing. So right now, we’ve been able to price through the impacts that we’ve been seeing around supply chain, commodity costs and logistics. So I’d say overall, we’re managing the pricing environment very well.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then the second question is just on free cash flow. Going forward, you had a significant benefit from accounts payable. How should we think about free cash flow dynamics as we look through the year? And how are you thinking about perhaps the ability – I mean, what’s going on now in Europe is sort of throwing this all in the air. But in terms of the ability to maybe manage inventory levels a bit better and bleed through some of the excess component inventory you may have. Thanks.
Marie Myers: Yes, no. Sure Shannon. So first of all I’d start out by saying that, look, we’re really pleased with the free cash flow in the quarter of $1.4 billion. And I’d just, at this point in time, reiterate that we’re still confident in our guide of at least $4.5 billion. And I’d just point out that given the supply chain challenges that you referred to, we are not planning to decrease our inventory as we originally commented. Therefore, we expect, at this point in time, to stay on track to our guide of at least $4.5 billion. In addition, I’d add, just in closing, that typically we don’t adjust out, I think, our free cash flow guide at in the quarter either.
Operator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Hi, good afternoon guys. Hey congrats on the solid execution and the ongoing amendment. I appreciate you guys taking the question. Two if I could. I guess I jumped on a few minutes late, so I apologize if this was already talked to. But what are you guys thinking at this juncture for PC growth for the year? And if you have like a calendar year view also, that would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up as well. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Let me – hi Ananda. I will give you, first, a view of what do we think in the market, and then Marie will give you some comments on the guide. I think market-wise, we continue to see strong demand on the PC side. The market projection for this year is that it will be around $200 billion bigger than what it was before the pandemic. And we don’t expect to see the level of growth that we saw in the past, but we think that the market is going to stay at the level where it is today, which is, again, significantly higher than it was before the pandemic. Now Marie will talk about our guide and what we expect to see in our side.
Marie Myers: Yes, Ananda. Good afternoon. I hope you are doing well. So for the year, we expect PS margins to be at the high end of the range. Now I would comment just to note that in Q1, there were some partner benefits from our Personal Systems partners that were onetime in nature. So if you look at our PS rate in Q1, if you exclude those benefits, we’re still ahead of the Q1 EPS range. But basically, we’d be at the high end. And so if you think about – the way to think about the margins in the rest of the year is really it’s that mix shift that we’re seeing towards commercial, those higher-margin categories are driving the rate. And finally, we’re seeing that the benefit of favorable pricing. And we’re really seeing the ability for us to be able to reprice for some of those commodity challenges that are out there in the market.
Ananda Baruah: That’s helpful. And then just my follow-up is, I know throughout 2021, you guys have been putting in some initiatives to improve your positioning for component allocation. And was just wondering what the state of those are today. And do you think you’ll be successful in procuring, so improving your component allocation share as you go through the year?
Enrique Lores: Let me take that question. So, I think the progress we are making is reflected in the strong results that we had in Personal Systems this quarter. As we said during our Investor Day, our focus was really on getting capacity and getting components for the premium categories for commercial, and the growth in this area reflects the progress we have made. So, we are pleased with the progress. At the same time, we have to acknowledge that the situation continues to be difficult. We expect to continue to be and to operate with high levels of inventory through the – of backlog through the end of the year, but we are making good progress, Ananda.
Operator: The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you. Since you spoke about PCs some, can we talk a little bit about printing? And specifically, can you talk about the supply chain about ink as well as print units in the channel versus equilibrium, a little bit about that? And then maybe my follow-up I’ll ask right now about what type of assumptions or page volumes are you expecting versus, say, pre-COVID levels?
Enrique Lores: So let me talk about the situation first on the hardware and then I will talk about supplies. On – from the hardware perspective, shipments this quarter have been impacted by availability of supply. As we shared both in our Investor Day and during our Q4 earnings call, we have a majority of the factories for printers and of our suppliers in Southeast Asia, and those countries were in full lockdown the majority of the fall until December. And therefore, we are seeing now the impact of that situation. Additionally, in Print, we used several components that are ASICs that have been designed by us, where also we are seeing shortages. So as a consequence of both, we clearly had our sales impacted this quarter, and we expect this to continue through the rest of the year. In the case of supplies, the situation has significantly improved. We don’t have any more limitations in terms of shipment. And the supplies business overall performed in a very positive way, similar to what we shared during our Investor Day, so no big deviation from the plan that we had.
Marie Myers: I’ll just add, on the comments on the channel, I think you brought up, right now for both print hardware and supplies, we’re comfortably within our range, and in some cases, due to those supply constraints that Enrique referred to, we’re actually below in some cases.
Jim Suva: Great. And then the follow-up about assumptions of return to the office versus pre-COVID levels for printing, what’s your thoughts on that?
Enrique Lores: Yes. So let me go, on the office side, again, no different from what we shared a few months ago. We expect that the volume of pages and the overall size for the market will be around 80%, 80, of what it was pre-COVID. We – and we are on our way to get there. Clearly, because of Omicron and the delays in some office reopening, we’re still not there, but we are seeing steady progress. In the case of home, the market is now stronger than what we were predicting before COVID, and we expect it to continue to be for the foreseeable future.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Maybe I could first ask for just better clarification on what is happening with backlog. I think Enrique, in your prepared remarks, you said that PC backlog came down in the quarter, but Marie said that supply was a constraint to PCs in the quarter. So maybe you can be explicit about either how your backlog changed in the quarter for both PCs and print hardware, or you can comment on order growth versus hardware in the quarter. That would be helpful to dimension that backlog question. And then I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So let me take that one. As I said in the prepared remarks, in the case of Personal Systems of PCs, we saw a decline of backlog during the quarter. It was driven by two things: number one is the progress we made on the supply chain side, being able to address the demand that we had in categories like commercial or premium. It was also was driven down because we saw a slowdown in some other categories like, for example, low-end consumer where we have seen a reduction of demand. The combination of both drove a reduction of backlog, but we are still operating with significantly higher backlog than what we normally do. So backlog remains elevated and we expect it to continue to be elevated for – during the next quarters. In the case of Print, the situation is different. Backlog grew quarter-on-quarter because of the two factors I explained before, where the factories are located and also the availability of certain components like ASICs or other type of power chips that we are still experiencing shortages.
Toni Sacconaghi: That’s helpful. I appreciate the color. Could you quantify specifically what happened to PC backlog in the quarter? I think last quarter, you said it was nearly a quarter of backlog, so either provide the number of weeks that it came down or what the relative order growth rate was in dollar terms for PCs relative to your revenue rate, that would be really helpful. And then just so I – just to clarify on guidance for my second question. It looks like normal seasonality is down 4% or 5% sequentially. I think on your last call, you sort of said this is going to be a wacky year in terms of normal seasonality. So, how do we think about what seasonal growth will be in Q2? I think you said PCs would be down high single digits sequentially. How do we think about overall revenue for HP on a sequential basis? And how do we sort of think about seasonality for the year? Are your comments around kind of a more smooth year still sort of how we should expect things or can you add any color on that? So just a follow-up on specificity on PC backlog, please and then Q2 and seasonality for the remainder of the year. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes. So on PC backlog, I will only be a little bit more specific. It is below one quarter, which is where we were, but continues to be very elevated. Maybe the other color I will provide is similar to what I shared a week last – a quarter ago, we are seeing it more concentrated now in some areas of the portfolio like commercial and premium home. This is where the backlog is elevated. And Marie will take the question on guide.
Marie Myers: Hey, Toni good afternoon. So in terms of just addressing your question around seasonality, very much in line with what we said at the Analyst Day that normal seasonality, I’ll just start out there, doesn’t apply for FY 2022. Obviously, now as you think about Q2 and beyond, we’ve had a very strong start to the year. And as a result of that, with the performance that we’ve had a year in Q1, we expect now a much more balanced first half versus second half. And so we’re no longer expecting our revenue to be more linear across the quarters as we have historically seen. And then just to sort of reiterate the point that you made around Personal Systems revenue, as we said earlier, due to the record revenue, the Russian situation and the continuing supply challenges that you’ve heard Enrique talk about, we do expect Q2 PS revenue to decline high single digits sequentially. I hope that helps.
Operator: The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I have two as well. I guess, first on the supply side, very specifically within Print, I think it was down 2%, 3% year-over-year in Jan quarter. I’m wondering how should we think about supplies in April quarter and even beyond because you compare start to get very difficult in that business. So, I’d love to understand how you’re going to see that supplies business stack up for the next couple of quarters, because I don’t think you have a whole lot of supply chain issues in that piece of the business.
Enrique Lores: So, I think on the – in supplies, what the performance is for this quarter is in line to the guide that we provided at some in during the Investor Day, where decline that we said we expected supplies to decline low to mid-single digits. And when we look at the rest of the year, we expect that this will continue and be aligned to that projection, Amit. Again, as I said before, supplies performed as we were expecting. Very small deviations, slight reductions or usage in the office side as offices were closed were probably below expectations, but share and price compensated for that. So overall, in line to what we were expecting.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow up, either Enrique and Marie, but when I think about the full year guide that’s been raised right now, you’re sort of implying 12%, 14% EPS growth, I think, for fiscal 2022. Could you just talk about how do I think about the delta or how much of that is going to come from buybacks versus operating profit dollar expansion, operating profit dollar growth? Because in Q1, at least, your shares on reduction was 15%. So if that momentum sustained, you could conceivably achieve your full year guide, even if your operating profit dollars don’t have any growth. So maybe just talk about how that math works for you for the year.
Marie Myers: Yes, sure. Good afternoon. It’s Marie here. So look, I think at our guide at Analyst Day, we commented that the operating profit flow-through was really a full fiscal year view. So, I’d just say that we’re confident that we will see the total of Print and PS operating profit dollars, that they will increase year-on-year for the full year 2022, though I would just point out, it’s probably going to vary quarter-by-quarter.
Enrique Lores: And I think it’s important to remember, Amit, that how strong last year was because we are saying we are going to be growing EPS and also profit after a very, very strong year. So that’s we always important to remember, given the compare that we had in 2021.
Operator: The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Marie, you noted this quarter-on-quarter decline on high single-digits to PS revenues. I was wondering if you could frame it a little differently sequentially. How should we be thinking about units versus ASPs? And correct me if I’m wrong here, but from your comments, it sounded like the size of the partner benefits to margins was roughly $100 million, which was onetime. Can you give us some color on that? And I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Yes. So just a couple of comments to help you then on the sequential on PS. So as I mentioned, we do see that single-digit sequential decline on PS revenue driven primarily, as I mentioned, around both the ongoing supply chain challenges and the Russia-Ukraine situation, which we also, I think, commented in my prepared remarks. So that’s what’s guiding the revenue. Then on the op margin, as I mentioned earlier, there were some partner benefits from our Personal Systems partners. They’re onetime in nature. Now if you basically sort of exclude those in Q1, that you would get back to basically the PS margin range being at the high end of the range, which is where we anticipate we will – what the results will look like the Q2.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, Marie. And Enrique, if I could. If we look at sort of a broader picture of what is happening with units, we’re starting to see a decline on a year-on-year basis. And it aligns fully with your comments on the comps being extremely tough from last year. Why should investors not be concerned that this deceleration in units is a leading indicator of an eventual compression of ASPs in Print, but also on the PC side? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Well, in the – thank you. In the case of Print, really shipments this quarter are really totally determined by availability of supply. So, I really wouldn’t read anything on declines of volumes because this is really totally driven by how many printers we and the rest of the market has been able to produce because it’s not – has not been an HP situation, it has heavily been an industry situation. In the case of Personal Systems, our view and the rest of the industry is that the size of the market this year will be in the 340 million to 350 million units. This is what it was a few months ago and continues to be. We also said that we expect the demand to shift towards commercial. This is what we have seen this quarter. And actually, if you look at our numbers, we grow significantly in both Windows-based PCs and commercial PCs, in many cases, above 20%. So it’s happening what we told the market it was going to happen. And when we look now at the funnel not only in backlog but at the funnel of opportunities we have for the second half in – for the rest of the year in commercial continues to be very strong.
Operator: The next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Erik Woodring: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. I think, I want to just follow up on that question and really just ask about the sustainability of PC ASPs. And I ask because I imagine your ability to leverage pricing gets more difficult as we move later into the year and supply improves plus you obviously face more difficult pricing comps. And so maybe just to dig down a little bit more. So, how should we think about maybe PC pricing versus units in the second half of this year? Any color that you can share there? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Yes. I think the evolution of pricing is really going to be determined by the difference between supply and demand. As I mentioned before, there are areas where the demand-supply, there is more balance between demand and supply like low-end consumer. And therefore, there, we expect to see more price competition. There are other areas like premium, like commercial, where really still demand is above supply, where we expect to continue to maintain the ability to price that we have had until now. And all these factors are built into the guide that we provided. I think it’s also important to highlight that within the Personal Systems side, we continue to see very high growth opportunities in the growth area that we have identified on both gaming, peripheral, workplace solutions are really growing in a very strong way, which also gives confidence in our ability to continue to grow in a sustainable way.
Erik Woodring: Awesome, I appreciate that. And then maybe just as my follow-up, you guys have committed to doing $5 billion of buybacks this year. But if I look back over the last quarters, you’ve done more than $1.5 billion of buybacks on average each quarter. So maybe why shouldn’t we think about buybacks and the rest of this fiscal year being – or for the total of this fiscal year being closer to $5 billion or $6 billion? And if they – if $4 billion is a target, would that imply or should we be thinking about buybacks slowing down into the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Well, I have to clarify because you mentioned $5 billion. Our goal and what we have said is that we will buy at least $4 billion of shares, and this continues to be our plan. So this is what I would build in your model. Yes, we bought more this quarter but our goal is to complete their value plan as we declared it three years ago and $4 billion is the minimum we need to do.
Operator: The next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you guys and thanks for taking the question. So my first question is, can you give us some more clarity on sort of the price increases that you pushed through on the printing side? I think earlier this year, kind of what the market reaction has been and the likelihood of that sticking as supply comes online as we move through the rest of this year. And I’ll just give you my second question as well, is when you think about backlog, I think you mentioned it’s primarily commercial and high-end consumer. Can you just kind of give us an update on where Chromebook sits in that backlog and how we should think about potentially Chromebook becoming a bigger part of the backlog as we move into, let’s say, the fall and next year’s holiday season and kind of the prospects for Chromebook becoming a bigger part of the business in the second half of the year? Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Let me take those questions. In the case of Print, I think we should differentiate hardware versus supply. In the case of hardware, the current shipments are so limited by supply that it had to read any implication on pricing because really what has been driving the number of units we have shipped is the number of units we have been able to produce. We are shipping everything we build. In the case of supplies where we also drive price increases, I think what is important to highlight is that for both ink and toner, despite the price increases, we were able to grow share, which I think is a very important metric that shows that the – from a volume perspective, we haven’t seen any negative impact on driven by the price increase.
Marie Myers: To Enrique’s point, our full year guide actually contemplates also those price increases as well.
Enrique Lores: And then your question on Chromebooks, let me – as I did a quarter ago, let me remind that Chromebook is a relatively small part of our business. We already said a quarter ago that the backlog for Chromebooks has been basically totally reduced. We are expecting demand for Chromebooks to start growing as we had seen in previous years, in the Q2, Q3 time frame. But at this point, we have enough availability of components on that side that we – and we don’t expect backlog to grow in that space.
David Vogt: And just quickly, that’s embedded in your PSG margin sort of a growth in the Chromebook business as we move through the year as well?
Enrique Lores: Yes. All of it is built into the guide and into the margin projections that we have, of course.
Operator: The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Hi, thanks for taking my question. If I can just start on Print first. In the commercial segment, Enrique, you mentioned the ongoing recovery in the office print business as well as the market share increases. Was really curious because I think even when we talk to one of your smaller competitors in the commercial print market, they talk about share increases. So if you can dive into that a bit more, what’s driving the share increase, particularly as you remain supply constrained, what drives longer-term share increases for HP in the commercial print business? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes, sure. My comment on share increases was specifically on supply, which as we heard a couple of years ago, is a big part of our strategy on supply. And what we have been doing during the last two years is to execute on the toner side, on the commercial printers, the same strategy that we had implemented on home printers for ink for previous years. And this is a combination of marketing efforts, it’s a combination of technology that we built in the printer, it’s the combination of improving the quality of supplies. And as a result of all of that, we are driving – we have been able to reverse a trend that we had in the past of losing share in toner. And as we have been sharing during the last quarters now, we are growing share of toner again. So that’s the – this is what I meant. In the case of hardware, there were also some improvements from a share perspective. But again, this is just driven by availability of supply. When we have supply, there is demand, and we’re able to ship more.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it, got it. And for my follow-up, I think this might be more for Marie, but the PS margins, I think, for the quarter, you mentioned you’ll be – once we exclude the partner benefits, you’ll be at the high end of the range that you specified, 5% to 7%. But how do we think about the higher cost of components or supply in that number? I’m just trying to think about, does that moderate as you go through the year or you take some supply actions? Is that going to drive that higher component cost to process for longer? How should I think about it? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yes. So with respect to our margin ranges for the rest of the year, we basically calibrated our ability to be able to reprice for commodities. So, I think we’ve done an excellent job of actually managing our pricing and really being able to deal with the volatility that we’re seeing across commodities, logistics and then repricing that through the market. So our PS margin, we expect it to be at the high end of the range for the remainder of the year, and it reflects that.
Enrique Lores: And I think this was our last question, so let me say thank you all for joining the call. As I said at the beginning of the call, we are really pleased with our start of the year. Clearly, the strategy that we have to modernize our core, expand into adjacencies and creating new businesses is growing, and this is reflected in the results that we posted today. And this, of course, gives us great confidence in our ability to grow revenue, operating profit, EPS and free cash flow in a sustained way. And today, before we leave, I want to invite all of you to join me in wishing Marie a very happy birthday because I am sure there is nothing better to do in her birthday than spending it with us in an earnings call. Marie, happy birthday.
Marie Myers: Thank you, Enrique.
Enrique Lores: And thank you, everybody, for joining.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q4  (2021-11-23 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 HP Inc., Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gary and I will be your conference moderator for today’s call. At this time all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.

Enrique Lores: Thanks, Orit. And thank you all for joining today's call. At our Securities Analyst Meeting last month, we shared our plans to continue building a stronger HP, one that delivers sustained revenue, operating profit, EPS, and free cash flow growth. This quarter results reflect our continued momentum against these plans, and they give us great confidence in our future. Let me talk through the details. In Q4 revenue grew 9% to $16.7 billion, non-GAAP EPS grew 52% to $0.94. And we generated more than $900 million of free cash flow while returning $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Our Q4 results are a great finish to an exceptional year. For the full year, we grew revenue 12% to $63.5 billion and generated $1.7 billion of incremental non-GAAP operating profit. Non-GAAP EPS grew 66%. This means that we exceeded our value creation plan target for non-GAAP operating profit and EPS a full year ahead of plan and we return a record $7.2 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth opportunities across the business. Our Q4 and full year performance shows our company on a strong foot and hitting its stride. Long-term secular trends such as hybrid play for our competitive thing. Our leadership across our markets and the innovation agenda we are diving are enabling us to turn these trends into tailwinds. We are making organic and inorganic investments to drive profitable growth. We are accelerating our transformation, building new digital capabilities, while also reducing structural costs and driving efficiencies. The progress we are making against our priorities is creating a more growth-oriented portfolio. At our Analyst Day, I shared that we expect our five key growth areas to grow double-digit and generate over $10 billion in revenue in fiscal '22. These businesses collectively grew 12% this quarter. This includes more than 30% growth for our Instant Ink business, as well as more than 20% growth for our industrial graphics portfolio. We see our key growth areas becoming a bigger part of overall revenue and profit mix moving forward. We are driving this growth even as we continue to navigate a complex and dynamic operational environment that includes robust demand and persistent supply constraints. The actions we have been taking to mitigate industry wide headwinds are paying off. There is no quick fix. But we are strengthening our operational execution and making continued progress quarter-by-quarter. And I just want to say how proud I am of the way our teams are stepping up. It has not been easy. But the challenges we have faced have not deterred from driving our business forward. And the fact that we delivered double-digit revenue and profit growth for the year gives us confidence that we enter 2022. Let me now talk about the strength we see across each of our business units. In personnel systems, there continues to be very strong demand. PS revenue and operating profit, each grew double-digit in Q4. And our disciplined execution and pricing strategy allowed us to effectively manage costs and components headwinds. A big part of our success is the improved mix we are driving given our leadership in the commercial PC market. As more offices reopen, we lead our shift toward Windows based commercial products where we saw their strongest demand and highest profitability. We continue to see a significantly elevated order backlog. As I shared last month, we expect component shortages, particularly in ICs to persist into at least the first half of '22. The operational actions we outlined in our Q3 call are generating positive results. We continue to increase our direct engagement with tier two and tier three suppliers. We have expanded long-term agreements to secure capacity. And our digital transformation initiatives are enabling greater real-time visibility to optimize our speed, agility and mix. This work remains a daily priority and we expect our trajectory to continue to improve. We're also creating important innovation that we design for all things hybrid. This includes a new lineup of Windows 11 devices that enable premium computing experiences for work and home. We are also expanding into valuable adjacencies. Last quarter, we introduced HP Presence, the world's most advanced video conferencing system. This is a large opportunity that will continue to grow as our digital and physical worlds converge. Seven out of 10 companies are already investing in technologies that improve hybrid work experience for their employees. HP Presence combined our hardware, software, imaging and peripheral capabilities to create a more immersive experience so that distributed teams can truly feel they are in the same room even if they are not. You will see us continuing to innovate and expand our presence in the growing hybrid collaboration space. We also delivered another quarter of double-digit device as a service revenue growth. This included the launch of new digital services to help commercial customers simplify the complexity of hybrid IT environments. And following the close of our Teradici acquisition, we learned a lineup of new Z by HP, Teradici and Nvidia Omniverse subscription offers to enable high performance remote collaboration. Turning to print, we grew revenue 1% in the quarter. This was primarily driven by our disciplined pricing strategy, as well as our continued growth in services and subscriptions, which offset expected volume declines driven by limited supply. Like others in the industry, we continue to operate in a supply constrained environment driven by COVID-related disruptions and broader logistics issues. Against this backdrop, demand for our prints hardware and supplies remained strong. The fact is, we had more hardware orders that we could fulfill in the quarter. And we said last month, we expect this to impact print growth in fiscal year '22. But this is not stopping us from advancing our strategic priorities. We continue to grow our HP plus portfolio globally, including a rollout to our Envy 7000 series that is designed for families working, learning and creating new memories from home. Importantly, it is built with sustainability in mind and made from over 45% recycled plastic content. We will also grow in our digital services to enable high-risk office printing. A great example is this quarter's launch of HP Managed Print Flex, a new cloud first MPS subscription plan for hybrid work environment. In Q4, we drove double-digit growth of MPS revenue and total contract value. And they support our Workforce Solutions momentum. We are increasingly integrating our offerings across print and personal systems to meet new customer needs and unlock new growth opportunities. Our recently launched HP Work from Home Service is a great example of how we are leveraging our diverse portfolio to win in the hybrid office. As I mentioned earlier, we are also driving industrial graphics and 3D printing growth. In industrial graphics, we drove double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and have built a healthy backlog of industrial presence. This continues the positive recovery trends from prior quarters. We also continue to see a mix shift towards more productive industrial presence with significant growth in labels and packaging. And in 3D, our focus on high value end-to-end application is paving the way for entirely new growth businesses. Our molded fiber, footwear and products initiatives are on track. Our progress against our strategic priorities is also driving strong cash flow. And we continue to be disciplined stewards of capital. We have a robust return-based approach that we are applying to every aspect of our capital allocation. We will continue to invest in areas where we see growth opportunities while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. We believe our shares remains undervalued and we are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $4 billion in fiscal year ‘22. We also expect M&A will continue to play an important role. Specifically, we plan to pursue deals that accelerate our strategies and drive profitable growth. And we are making ongoing progress against our sustainable impact agenda. ESG is a driver of long-term value creation for all stakeholders. And we continue to pursue an ambitious agenda. The latest example is our expanded partnership with World Wildlife Fund. We are working to restore, protect and improve the management of nearly 1 million acres of forest landscapes. This supports our focus on making every page printed forest positive. To sum up, our portfolio is innovative and resilient. Our strategy is driving sustained revenues, operating profits, EPS, and free cash flow growth. We are returning, highly attractive levels of capital to shareholders. And we are confident in the fiscal year '22 guidance that we shared at our Analyst Day. We are entering the New Year from a position of great strength. And I look forward to continuing to share our progress. Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal Q1 outlook. Marie, over to you.
Marie Myers: Thanks, Enrique. And hello, everyone. It's good to be back together. And it was great to connect with so many of you following your Analyst Day. I want to start by building on something Enrique said a moment ago. Q4 was a strong finish to a very strong year. It builds on our proven track record of meeting or exceeding the goals we set. And it underscores our confidence in our FY '22 and long-term financial outlook. Let me begin by providing some additional color on our results, starting with the full year. Revenue was $63.5 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating profit was $5.8 billion, up 42%. We grew non-GAAP EPS even faster, up 66% to $3.79. This continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation. Our $4.2 billion of free cash flow was consistent with our full year guidance and adjusting for the net Oracle litigation proceeds and we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders. That’s a 172% of free cash flow. What’s especially important to note is how well balanced our performance is. We are growing our top and bottom-line. We are returning capital to shareholders and investing in the business. We are accelerating new growth businesses and driving efficiencies. This reflects the company geared towards both short and long-term value creation as we enter a new period of growth for HP. This is supported by our Q4 numbers. Net revenue was $16.7 billion in the quarter, up 9% nominally and 7% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency: Americas declined 4%, EMEA increased 15% and APJ increased 18%. As Enrique mentioned, supply chain constraints continue to impact both Print and Personal Systems revenue and this was particularly impactful to our print hardware results this quarter. That said, demand remain strong as hybrid work creates sustained tailwinds. Gross margin was 19.6% in the quarter, up 2 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing including currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion or 11.5% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.3 billion, up 28% and non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased $0.32, up 52% to $0.94 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes Oracle litigation gains, defined benefit plan settlement gains, non-operating retirement related credits, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $2.71. Now, let’s turn to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems revenue was $11.8 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Total units were down 9% given the expected supply chain challenges and lower chrome mix. The fact we still grew revenue double digits in this environment reflected the strength of demand and positive impact of our big shift towards mainstream and premium commercial. Drilling into the details, consumer revenue was down 3% and commercial was up 25%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for notebooks, 11% for desktops and 39% for workstations. We also continue to drive double-digit growth across peripherals and services. Personal Systems delivered $764 billion in operating profit with operating margins of 6.5%. Our margin improved 1.4 points, primarily due to continued favorable pricing, product mix and currency, partially offset by higher cost including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go-to-market. In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio as we navigated the supply chain environment. Q4 total print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 1%, driven by favorable pricing in hardware and growth in services, partially offset by a decline in supplies. Total hardware units declined 26% due to consumer replenishment last year in Q4 and increased manufacturing and component constraints. We expect these print hardware constraints to extend at least into the first half of 2022. By customer segment, consumer revenue was down 6%, with units down 28%. Commercial revenue grew 19%, with units down 12%. Consumer demand remained solid. However, revenue across both home and office was constrained by the current supply and factory environment. The commercial recovery should further progress with a double-digit hardware revenue growth with triple-digit increases in Industrial printing hardware. We expect to see a continued gradual and uneven recovery in commercial extending into FY ’22. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, declining 2% year-on-year, driven primarily by prior year channel inventory replenishment. We also saw steady normalization of ink and toner mix, partially offset by favorable pricing. We saw continued momentum in our contractual business. As we discussed at our Analyst Day, this is a key part of our broader services strategy. Instant ink delivered double-digit increases in both cumulative subscriber growth in revenue. We also drove growth in managed print services revenue and total contract value with strength in both renewals and new TCV bookings. Print operating profit increased $117 million to [$813 million] [ph] and operating margins were 17%. Operating margin grew 2.2 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing and improved performance in industrial including graphics 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix at higher cost including commodity costs and investments in innovation and go-to-market. Now let me turn to our transformation efforts. As we completed the second year of our cost savings program, we have now delivered more than 80% of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan and we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities. Transformation is not only about cost savings, but about also creating new capabilities and long-term value creation. One example. I’d like to highlight is our ongoing digital transformation. By leveraging our new digital platforms, we are enhancing our capabilities and transforming the way we operate to deliver new solutions to our customers. With this capability, we recently launched Wolf Pro Security, a new subscription service that enables customers to digitally manage their software on an annual subscription basis. The structural cost savings with our transformation efforts are enabling us to invest in these types of strategic growth drivers and we see many more opportunities like this to drive business enablement through additional software services and solutions offerings. Let me now move to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion and free cash flow was $0.9 billion after the additional adjustment for the net Oracle litigation proceeds of $1.8 billion. The cash conversion cycle was minus 25 days in the quarter. This deteriorated 4 days sequentially as lower days payable outstanding and higher days sales outstanding was only partially offset by the decrease in days of inventory. For the quarter, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders, which represented 210% of free cash flow. This included $1.75 billion in share repurchases and $219 million in cash dividends. For FY ’21, we returned a record $7.2 billion to shareholders or a 170% of free cash flow. Looking ahead to FY ’22, we expect to continue aggressively buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $4 billion. Our share repurchase program, combined with our recently increased annual dividend of a $1 per share, has us on track to exceed our $16 billion return of capital target set in our value creation plan. Looking forward to Q1 and FY ’22, we continue to navigate supply availability, logistics constraints, pricing dynamics and the pace of the economic recovery. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our Q1 and overall fiscal 2022 financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial, as well as favorable pricing. We expect solid PS revenue growth to continue into fiscal ’22 with the shift to higher growth categories, including commercial, premium and peripherals. We expect PS margins to be toward the high-end of our 5% to 7% long-term range. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer, a continued normalization in mix as commercial gradually improves through 2022 and disciplined cost management. We expect Print margins to be towards the high end, about 16% to 18% long-term range. For Personal Systems, we expect the component shortages, as well as manufacturing port and transit disruptions will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic in many parts of the world. In Print, we expect similar, but more acute challenges, particularly with regard to factory disruptions and component shortages. We expect these challenges across PS and Print to persist at least through the first half of 2022. Furthermore, normal sequential seasonality doesn’t apply for FY ’22 and we expect our revenue performance to be more linear by quarter, particularly driven by PS. In addition, we expect a slight headwind year-on-year, approximately $20 million per quarter from corporate Investments and other. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook; we expect growth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.99 to $1.05 and first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.92 to $0.98. We expect full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $4.07 to $4.27 and FY ’22 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.86 to $4.06. For FY ’22, we expect free cash flow to be at least $4.5 billion. Overall, I feel very good about our performance and our outlook. I am confident in our ability to deliver consistent long-term sustainable growth and we look forward to taking your questions. So let me hand it back to the operator.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my first question really is on the personal systems side, a very impressive, I think, reversal on the growth profile versus last quarter ago. It looks like it's heavily driven by ASP's. If my math is right, maybe ASPs are up close to 20%. So I'd love to understand, when I look at the ASP uplift, how much of that is just mix because you perhaps had less Chromebooks versus just apples-to-apples price increases? And then how should we think about the durability of that ASP increase as you go forward into the next fiscal year?
Enrique Lores: Hi, Amit, thank you for the question. Let me start and then Marie will provide more detail. So first of all, as you said, we are very pleased with the performance of the PC business this quarter. It is really a consequence of the strong demand that we continue to see, both across consumer, but especially in commercial and the way we have been managing both mix and pricing as you were saying. We have been very effectively managing both, driving the component that we have toward the categories where we saw the highest value for the company, which in general the commercial categories and the high end of the consumer side. And this has really been driving the performance that you saw. And now Marie will comment on pricing.
Marie Myers: Sure. Good afternoon, Amit. So, first of all, just to give you some context around ASP's, they're actually up 24% year-on-year and 17% Q-on-Q and what's driving that is really a combination of favorable pricing including some currency, but as you said there's that favorable mix into higher commercial, as well as even a mix shift inside commercial to both premium and mainstream. So we've got less low-end and that favorable mix shift within consumer. In terms of year-on-year, consumers up 11%, driven predominantly by pricing and commercial is up 31.7%, which is a combination of both mix and pricing. And as we've said earlier and I think in our Security Analyst Meeting, we do expect to see some of that favorable mix shift to continue into the following year as well.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. And if I could just follow up, Enrique, I think everyone is sort of used to thinking as supply revenues go down, print margins will be under pressure. And certainly, I think what you're seeing right now, what you're guiding for more important in fiscal '22 would say even if supply start to decline margins should hold up in that 17% to 18% kind of range. So I'd love to get -- kind of get your perspective, what are the two or three big things, vectors that investors should think about that is enabling print margins to expand even as supplies revenues might be a little bit more down next year?
Enrique Lores: Thank you. And this is really consistent to what we -- the strategy that we started to execute two years ago, when we are driving the change of profitability from supplies more into hardware. And as we shared during Analyst Meeting, we have been making very good progress driving that strategy. We have increased the mix of products that includes supplies when customers buy them, what we call profit up from products. We have also increased the percentage of end-to-end systems, what we call now HP+. And we have also been driving a transition toward subscription and service-oriented businesses. That is also contributing very positively from a profitability perspective. So what you see happening is what we said two years ago we were going to drive. We have been making good progress and this makes us confident in the guide that we provided for fiscal year '22 in our Analyst Day and about the guidance we have provided today for Q1.
Marie Myers: Also just to keep in mind that I'm sure you know this that we're lapping some tough compares. So what we're really focused on is driving incremental OP dollars over time and driving more OP dollars outside of supply and it's exactly what Enrique said to really shifting the business model.
Operator: The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Congrats on the strong results. Yes, just two if I could. Enrique, any new anecdotal you guys clearly continue to sound as net positive on demand as you did five weeks ago at the Analyst Day. But any new context over the last five weeks with regards to what you're seeing, customer conversations, conversion, anything like that you picked up over the last five weeks would be super helpful? And then I have a quick follow-up.
Enrique Lores: What we have seen is, I'm sorry to disappoint you is very consistent to what we discussed in our Analyst Day. We continue to see strong demand, especially from commercial customers and we share their office -- as companies are reopening offices, getting employees back to work, they're investing to improve their experiences and therefore they improve investing in PCs and invest in notebooks and desktops. We also are seeing strong consumer demand as the holiday season comes. We are seeing demand behaving as per plan, so no deviations from what we discussed a few weeks ago.
Marie Myers: We had a great quarter with backlog too. So our backlog still remains elevated.
Ananda Baruah: Yes. Thanks Marie for that. And then, I guess the follow-up is on the commercial side, any distinction to make what you're seeing between two enterprises small medium business, small medium business has been a good chunk of your business for a while. And so any distinction to make there between the center of demand between those two? Thanks.
Enrique Lores: I wouldn't make any big distinction. We see growth across the board, both for large enterprises and for SMBs. We have a very strong business in both areas and we see demand in the two customer segments, so no major deviations from that. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could maybe just provide a little more detail on your backlog. I think last quarter you said that your backlog in PCs was about 13 weeks. Can you provide an update on that? And you mentioned that print, hardware was probably the most supply constrained. So, perhaps if you can dimension the backlog and how much it may have changed in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please.
Enrique Lores: So in terms of PC backlog, it remains at a very elevated level, Toni, very similar to where we were a quarter ago. So, no major changes. It continues to be similar to what you saw despite a quite a strong business that we have created this quarter. And then, in terms of print, you are correct, print hardware is where we have seen the major supply chain limitations, largely because of the factory lockdowns in many Southeast Asia countries, which is what we shared during the last week. So no news here. And part of this also elevated but is lower than what we have on PCs.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just to follow-up, you talked about the strength in pricing. Prices were up 17% sequentially in PCs, yet your operating margins in PCs were the lowest they were all year. I know there were some incremental supply chain costs, but that kind of price leverage, why did you not see greater operating profit leverage? And then, somewhat related to that, I think you basically said we should sort of ignore traditional seasonality and kind of think of flattish growth throughout the year, but if you're actually going to make any progress in drawing down your backlog and demand remain strong, your seasonality actually should be above normal seasonality because demand is continuing at the same rate, but you're getting a tailwind from backlog ultimately if you're able to draw that down. So maybe you could just help provide some color on both of those things, potential inconsistencies and set me straight? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Yes. No worries, Toni, and good afternoon. So when I talk first about seasonality and I'd say that first out that we've seen that strength in the quarter in PS and we do expect that to continue into '22. So as a result, we do expect revenue linearity in the year to be more linear across the quarters and that's more so, Toni, than what we've seen in the last few years. So as sequential revenue growth in '22 is therefore going to be more consistent quarter-to-quarter. And I'll just reiterate like I did it I think at the San Meeting that we don't expect normal seasonality. And then, with respect to the PS operating margins in the quarter. The rate was actually down slightly quarter-on-quarter and that was just really due to you might recall the material change in estimate that we had back in Q3. And also you saw just the strength of the business that we actually had. So we did take the opportunity to make some one-time investments that we don't expect that they are probably going to repeat in in '22.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. Enrique, could you talk a bit about your peripherals initiative, and how -- what we should look for in terms of proof points, and what you've done internally to try to improve that business so that it can contribute in fiscal 2022? And then I've a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Shannon. So as we said in our Analyst Day, peripherals is one of the five growth areas of the company, and we think that really is going to be contributing to the sustained growth that we expect to see in Personal Systems. We have done a lot of changes internally to manage the business better. We -- in the past, if you remember, we were calling it attach, and when you call our business attach, you don't put a best engineer, you don't put a investment that the business requires and you don't have the organizational focus, and we have changed all that. We have a dedicated organization to peripherals. We have put some of the strongest leaders in the company to drive that initiative. We are increasing internal investment. We are moving some of our best engineers to the Group, and we have also invested in organic in acquisitions as the acquisition we did with HyperX to reinforce our position in some specific area, like in the case of HyperX in peripherals for gaming. What you will see us doing in the future is to continue to invest in this space. We think we have a great opportunity to continue to grow going forward and we will be providing regular updates of the progress that we are going to see in that category going forward. And just to close, this quarter we have double-digit growth in this category. So we are really pleased with the growth in peripherals.
Shannon Cross: Okay. Thank you. And then I was wondering if you could give us an update on 3D printing, what kind of contribution you're seeing? I know you're not going to give a specific numbers, but where that's -- how that's going coming out of the pandemic and where you're seeing strong demand? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. So let me cover 3D printing from two angles. First is after the pandemic, we are seeing very strong growth in what I would call the traditional 3D printing, basically selling printer, selling supplies and selling services around those, very strong growth we have seen really a pickup of demand. But also, we shared during our Investor Day that we have complemented that part of the business with the investment in three specific end-to-end, we call it applications or businesses where we think we have the opportunity of capturing more value, because we are not just selling the printers, we are designing the parts, and in some cases, we are also selling the parts to the consumers or to the end-users. And we shared in our Investor Day that we were working on molded fiber and sustainable packaging and on orthotics and on footwear, three areas where of businesses in the $8 billion to $12 billion, where we can really drive a strong disruption because we think 3D printing is really going to help us to grow and to transform those industries. So great progress, we are on track, this is what we discussed a few weeks ago. And during 2022, we will continue to provide updates on where we see this business going.
Operator: The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. There is a pretty wide dispersion in revenue growth across the regions this quarter with Americas down 4% and double-digit positive growth in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. What explains that dispersion, some of it is year-on-year comps, but that's not nearly all of it? Are prices passing through in different rates across the regions? Is there differences in how the distribution channels are rebuilding inventory coming out of the downturn, just any context around the pretty wide dispersion in geographic growth? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Yes, I think the dispersion is really driven by what -- how we've been prioritizing and where we have seen growth. If you think about a year ago, we saw very strong growth on the consumer business in North America. And as we have shared, we are now driving our business more towards higher premium categories mostly in commercial, and therefore, this has implications on the year-on-year comparison. This is really what is driving that delta, Katy.
Katy Huberty: Okay. And then as a follow-up maybe for Marie, inventory was a use of cash over the past year, it did come down in the fourth quarter. Should we assume that your balance sheet inventory gradually normalizes as you move through fiscal '22?
Marie Myers: Yes, no, we expect basically for our inventory levels to remain somewhat elevated while we're through this supply chain constrained environment. However, we do expect to moderate our components depending on the supply and the demand that we see around the components. But certainly as we look forward into the first half of '22, we still expect to see those levels somewhat elevated.
Enrique Lores: What you saw Katy is like, what we -- if we're seeing -- if we look at components where availability has improved with the need to maintain those levels of inventory and there we -- therefore we are correcting that. But as Marie was saying, since we expect to continue to be in a supply constrained environment at least through the first half, inventory will stay at high levels.
Operator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Angela Chan: Hi. This is Angela Chan on for Samik Chatterjee. Just had one question, wanted to dig in a little into the margin here. I think someone mentioned earlier that you had 17% price increase in PCs, and so just thinking about moving forward assuming you have for a favorable pricing into fiscal year '22 and that the supply situation at least starts to, seems to be stabilizing or may be easing a bit, should we expect to see margin for to remain at that elevated level even beyond your first quarter guidance?
Marie Myers: Yes, no, sure, and good afternoon. So we are very much on track towards the high end of our long-term SAM range which we gave at our Analyst Day for PS. So we continue to see that strong demand for our PCs, particularly in commercial and we expect to see that favorable pricing as well, and that's how we think about our guide for Q1. I would just add, I think I mentioned to Toni that we were down slightly Q-on-Q and that was really driven by the material change in estimate we had last quarter. But going forward, we absolutely expect our PS margins to continue to be at the high end of our long-term range.
Enrique Lores: And just a brief reminder, we increased our long-term range a few weeks ago. So what we are saying is we are going to stay at the high end of the new ranges that we just provided.
Angela Chan: Great. Thank you.
Operator: The next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Sidney Ho: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I got two questions. First one is you mentioned your backlog is staying at elevated level, now that you have another quarter of serving this dynamics, can you talk about how you monitor to make sure that orders are real, and how confident are you that once supply constraints start to ease you don't see a sharp decline in -- sharp increase in cancellation rate or decline in this backlog? And I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Yes, thank you. So, as we have shared in the past, this is really something that we pay a lot of attention to, and we constantly monitor all the orders that we get, the quality of the orders and what cancellations are happening. And as we have shared before, the percentage of cancellations is very, very slow -- is very, very small. So we have not seen any cancellations. Also as we look at the competition of the backlog, the majority of the backlog now is coming from commercial customers, given that this is where we continue to see the stronger demand. Usually, there is an end user or in many cases, it is an end-user associated with our backlog, so it means the probabilities of double booking or cancellations even lower. But we rest assured, this is something we monitor constantly and we don't see any cancellations. Now, of course, our goal is to over time to reduce the amount of backlog that we have because -- and we expect that, that supply will get normalized during the next quarter, we will be reducing the amount of backlog that we have.
Sidney Ho: Great. That's helpful. Maybe my follow-up question is on the free cash flow for fiscal '22 of more than $4.5 billion, how should we think about the profile of that going to look like as we go through the year, typically you see the lowest free cash flow in fiscal second quarter and highest in fiscal third quarter, but this year could be different, but any other factors we should be thinking about? And kind of related to that, how may that change the amount of share buyback as we go through the year? Thanks.
Marie Myers: Yes, so maybe I'll hit up cash flow and then we'll go to the buyback. So, first of all, we guide cash flow on an annual basis. And as we mentioned at SAM, we're confident in our guide of at least $4.5 billion. A couple of things to bear in mind, obviously cash flows driven by revenue and operating profit growth, and then secondly, I think we did comment that we did expect to see some favorable working capital as we start to see those inventory levels potentially moderate in the second half. So that's how we're thinking about, we've built that all into our guide basically in terms of free cash flow. With respect to our buybacks, we remain committed to repurchase at least 4 billion of our shares, and as you probably recently saw at our Analyst reports, Analyst meeting as well, we're expecting to pay out a dividend of $1 per share. So I think really a meaningful plan there with respect to our buybacks starting to return of capital to our shareholders.
Operator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I just have one question, it's more of a financial philosophical question. And trying to think through your long-term financial framework that sort of underpins the high single-digit EPS growth that you laid out at SAM, and if I just take sort of your framework at face value as operating profit grows and your dividend grows along with up profit and/or earnings, what are sort of the parameters that you're using to think about the buyback in terms of how much you want to use, because as the stock appreciates, and let's say the multiple expansion you no longer quote-unquote undervalued or maybe even less value, I would imagine that you might ratchet down or maybe pull back on the buyback, and that seems to be a pretty important part of the longer-term EPS growth that you've laid out at the SAM. So just want to get a bit of an understanding how you're thinking about it over the longer-term? Thanks.
Marie Myers: Yes, maybe I'll just start out by commenting firstly that our FY22 guidance is a combination of both operational flow-through and the results of share buyback. Now addressing your question specifically about how we're sitting, thinking about your philosophical question around the buybacks, look I would just say that we're absolutely committed to the capital allocation strategy that we've outlined at SAM, and those ingredients, nothing has changed there and a big part of that is our return of capital to shareholders. So we're on track to continue to buy back shares at elevated levels of at least 4 billion. And in fact, I think we're going to surpass what we said we do back at our value plan of at least $16 billion. So that's how we're thinking about it, and our commitment really hasn't changed.
Enrique Lores: And maybe to complement a little what Marie was saying. What we have committed is that we will be returning, and I'm talking about the long-term, 100% of free cash flow unless other better opportunities arise, and we have also committed to increase our leverage ratio to two points, and we will be doing this over time. So both will be sources of cash that we will be using to return capital to shareholders or potentially to M&A, if we -- if M&A would bring better returns.
David Vogt: Great. Maybe just as a quick follow-up, Enrique. So does that imply that the dividend effectively a sort of -- a sort of marching in lockstep with sort of earnings growth and then the flexible use of cash flow between M&A will be -- the cash flow will be between M&A and buybacks over the longer-term?
Enrique Lores: I believe, while we believe that the shares are undervalued, and this is clearly the situation today, so this is what you should expect us to do, thinking at least while we see that delta.
Operator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Hi. Yes, thank you. In your prepared commentary, Enrique, you mentioned that M&A -- you also called out M&A as an important lever, and I was curious, just given the strong cash flow, free cash flow that you would be generating plus the payment from Oracle, you have a sizable warchest for M&A. So any sizing parameters, anything that you can share with us, and what you're looking, should we expect similar to what you've done here in the recent past or something larger?
Enrique Lores: Yes, so let me kind of remind what we have been discussing during the last weeks. First is, we have shared that M&A is an important part of our plan. Second, we have identified five key growth areas for the company, where we think M&A could help us to grow profitably at a faster way and that we are scanning opportunities to do that. At the same time, we have also said that we are going to be very rigorous stewards of capital that any opportunity we would take versus the strategy, versus the operational ability that we need to have to deliver on the financial goals, and then, of course, we need to have attractive returns, whether to return the buyback shares, which is a fairly high threshold given that we believe that shares are undervalued. In terms of specific side, I don't think we have any -- we haven't made any commitment on -- commitments on that space. They really need to deliver strong financial results and based -- and that be aligned with their strategies. But we are not going to do anything different because of the Oracle cash that we got. We are going to continue to manage capital with the framework that we have been discussing until now and with the same rigor.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks, Enrique. If I could follow up, a few people have asked about the ASP and the sustainability, and clearly you talk about strong demand backlog and this ASP strength to sustain in fiscal '22. But if I could ask it maybe a little differently, how much of this ASP increase would you attribute to the tightness in the market, which is driving favorable pricing versus potentially as supply improves over the course of the next few quarters, do you still anticipate the mix can drive these sort of elevated levels of ASP growth? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Yes, I think the key thing really is what is going to be the gross margin that we will be delivering or the operating profit margin. And as Marie was saying, we increased our guidance a few weeks ago and we expect to continue to be at the high end of the range through 2022. What we think will happen is eventually the price favorability will reduce as volumes will increase, but as volumes will increase, we will also see additional business. So one will compensate the other. So we will stay within the high end of the range through 2022.
Marie Myers: And I'd just add, we are still in that, it's a bit like the laws of economics while you're in a supply constrained environment, favorable pricing really persist, but in addition, demand is strong. So together, that really contributes to what we've seen in terms of this favorable pricing dynamic, which we do expect will continue through '22, but we do expect some normalization as the year goes on as well.
Operator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Jake Arbon: Hi, this is Jake on for Aaron. Congrats on the great quarter. Just really quick, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the graphics market and then kind of just how you're thinking about that business heading into 2022?
Enrique Lores: Yes. So we are seeing a strong recovery of the overall industrial graphics business, mostly driven for the -- by the more industrial side driven by label and packaging. We have seen nice growth in Q4 and we expect to see very nice growth in 2022. So really good progress and really a contributor of growth for the company in 2022.
Jake Arbon: And just as kind of a follow-up on to that. Is that a market you guys would be targeting for M&A with just how fragmented it is, is that something you're focused on?
Enrique Lores: Well, we have a very strong portfolio in that category that is a combination of both internal development of M&A that we have done over the years. We have done several acquisitions in that space, both in printing technologies and also in software, and we have identified this as one of the key five growth areas of the company. And as I said, M&A is part of our plan, we expect to continue to do that in 2022. And as we also shared, we have room to do that, while at the same time, we return aggressive capital to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends. And as I said before, over time, we will be increasing our ratio to 1.5 to 2, which will be also another source of capital.
Jake Arbon: Great. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: And I think it's now time to wrap up. So let me close the call by saying that we really feel strong about the quarter that we have, it's a great proof point of the ability that we have to deliver value to our shareholders and shows the strong momentum that we have entered in fiscal year '22. And this is why we provided the guide that we provided for Q1 that shows the things that we see in our business. So, thank you everybody for the call today. And we wish all of you a great Thanksgiving with your families. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-27 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon. And welcome to the HP Inc. Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Howe: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.

Enrique Lores: Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. I hope that you and your families are safe and well. It's an important time for us to connect. The hybrid world taking shape is expanding our addressable market and creating new opportunities to drive profitable growth. We have already started to capitalize on this and have a long runway ahead. This is evident in our Q3 performance. We delivered another quarter of top and bottom-line growth with EPS growing substantially faster than revenue. This reflects continued progress against our strategic priorities and strong and sustained demand for our products and services. In Q3, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, an increase of 7%. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 71% to $1.2 billion. Non - GAAP EPS increased to $1 compared to $0.49 in Q3 last year. And we generated $1 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.7 billion to shareholders. Before I take you through the highlights, I want to first share three key points of context as you think about our performance and outlook. First, as I mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services. The hybrid world is accelerating trends in our segments and our leadership across commercial and consumer categories positioned as well, even as demand continues to outpace supply. The second point is that we continue to ship as much products as we can while navigating a complex operational environment. We are managing through component shortages, COVID-related factory lockdowns in Southeast Asia, and congested ports, and transportation disruptions. Even under these conditions, we delivered solid financial results. And third, we are performing while transforming our business models and service offerings to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities. We have continued to make progress, reducing our fixed cost structure, evolving our business model, and creating new growth businesses. And we are expanding our time in key segments to drive additional top and bottom-line growth. In Personal Systems, we will be driven by our focus on peripherals and new computing models. In Printing, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings. I will talk about all of these in more detail by looking at the progress we're making across our portfolio. In Personal Systems, demand for our products continued to be strong with our backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. PC penetration rates are growing across our markets, as devices become increasingly essential in today's hybrid world. While we delivered strong operating profit, PS revenue was less than we expected primarily because of our supply chain constraint. We expect industry-wide supply shortages, particularly in ICs, to continue into 2022. Given these, we have identified the necessary improvements we need to make and at accelerating that execution to drive stronger top-line performance. We expect that it will take more than one quarter to show results. As we ramp supply, our PS portfolio is extremely well-positioned for the hybrid world, and we see significant opportunities for market expansion. And our leading share in commercial PCs position us well as more businesses reopen. In the commercial market, we launched a new all-in-one and expanded our ZBook portfolio of high-performance PCs for Creative Professionals. This includes the ZBook Studio G8, the world's most powerful mobile workstation of its size. And our new civil power brings ZBook performance to students, SMB, and the public sector. In Q3, we also launched a new Pavilion line-up that brings premium computing experiences into the mainstream with a series of new displays that are purpose-built for home-office and entertainment setup. And we continued to drive momentum outside of our core hardware businesses. This quarter, we completed our acquisition of HyperX, giving us a leading position in gaming peripherals and a platform from which to accelerate our peripheral leadership more broadly. We also continue to advance our device as a service business, which grew 32% in the quarter. And we are investing to meet emerging customer needs in the commercial space. This is highlighted by our recent agreement to acquire Teradici Corporation. Teradici Software is widely used by leading organizations around the world to deliver superior remote computing solutions. We expect this deal will accelerate new computer models and services tailored for hybrid work environment. In Printing, revenue was up 24% driven by recovery in commercial and strength in consumer. As in Personal Systems, the rise of all things hybrid plays to our strengths and is creating new opportunities for print innovation and growth. Specifically, we are expanding our services and subscription offerings, each of which delivered double-digit growth this quarter. We continued to sell HP+ and Instant Ink across North America and Europe, including the addition of HP+ on the Envy and DeskJet product family. We have seen positive response to HP+ to date. And HP's Instant Ink hit a major milestone by surpassing 10 million subscribers. Our subscription services are providing a simple and seamless experience for today's hybrid workers, paving the way for new offerings in the future. We also continued to evolve our hardware portfolio with success in our award-winning HP LaserJet 400 and 500 Series. HP continues to be recognized as a Best Managed Print vendor, helping SMB solution providers thrive in a competitive market where quality and security are essential. The strength of our position in the commercial market is significant as more people return to the office. In our industrial businesses, we drove very strong hardware revenue growth in the quarter. Importantly, our number of pages printed is at or above 2019 levels. We once again saw double-digit growth in print impressions and square meters, as well as strength in key categories like labels and packaging. And in 3D, we remain focused on driving high-value end-to-end applications in strategic vertical markets. This quarter, we launched the new Arize Orthotic Solution. It leverages HP 3D printing and cloud-based software to help the millions of patients who suffer from foot pain. It is a great example of the opportunity we see to develop industries with highly personalized solutions. Our combination of innovation and execution enables us to continue making progress across our business and portfolio. And we remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investments. In Q3, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders and have returned $6.8 billion over the past 12 months. We believe our shares remain undervalued and are committed to aggressive repurchase levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. As part of our value creation strategy, we also remain focused on M&A that can accelerate our growth in strategic areas. HyperX and Teradici are two great examples. We will continue using our rigorous returns-based framework to evaluate and pursue deals that complement our strategy and accelerate new sources of value creation. As we drive our portfolio strategy and transformation agenda, we continue to prioritize making a sustainable impact. This quarter, we released our 20th Annual Sustainable Impact report that highlights the work we are doing in climate action, human rights, and digital equity, and outlined new 2030 goals. Not only is this the right thing to do, it's also driving business success. In 2020, our Sustainable Impact Initiative helped us win more than $1 billion in new sales for the second consecutive year. Aligned with this, we recently issued $1 billion in sustainability bonds. We are allocating these proceeds to ESG related initiatives consistent with our strategy and values. Looking ahead to Q4, our backlog remains significantly elevated. We expect robust demand to continue, and we are taking decisive steps to address operational headwinds. Our portfolio is strong and resilient, and we remain on track to significantly exceed the full-year EPS target we set in February. And today, we are raising our Q4 outlook. And more importantly, we plan to build on this performance and expect to grow full-year EPS in fiscal year '22. Longer-term, the hybrid world plays to our strength and creates attractive opportunities across our categories. We are well-positioned to drive sustained performance but we innovate, improve, and continue to reinvent for our customers, partners, and shareholders. I look forward to our upcoming October analyst meeting to discuss our strategy and our plans to drive continued business success. Let me now turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you.
Marie Myers: Thanks, Enrique. Looking at our third-quarter financial results, we delivered another solid quarter of revenue growth with Operating Profit and EPS growing substantially faster. We are continuing our transformation journey while generating strong free cash flow, returning significant capital to shareholders, and investing for long-term value creation. Looking at the details of Q3, net revenue was $15.3 billion, up 7% nominally and 4% in constant currency. Regionally in constant currency, America has increased 12%, EMEA increased 1%, and APJ declined 6%. Supply chain constraints affected both Print and Personal Systems revenue. And this was particularly impactful in EMEA and APJ in Personal Systems. Across Personal Systems and Print, we continued to see strong demand for our products and solutions, capitalizing on opportunities we see as the hybrid world takes shape. The gross margin was 22.2% up 5.5 points year on year. The increase was primarily driven by continued favorable pricing, including lower promotions, as well as a reduction to previously estimated sales and marketing [Indiscernible] incentives, as well as currency partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.9 billion, or 12.4% of revenue. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased investments in go-to-market and innovation, as well as higher variable compensation due to the very strong performance this fiscal year as compared to 2020. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $78 million for the quarter. Non - GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased from $0.51 to $1, including $0.25 related to the reduction in previously estimated incentives of which $0.12 were reinvested during the quarter, primarily at accelerating R&D, incremental marketing, and our hybrid work strategy. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude net expense totaling $90 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangibles, acquisition-related charges, debt extinguishment costs, other tax adjustments, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.92. Before I get into the details of the segments, let me briefly address the reduction in previously estimated sales and marketing program incentives. Consistent with our policies, we review these estimates every quarter. We estimate incentives based on a number of factors like historical experience, customer behavior, and market conditions. The change in estimate is a result of lower-than-expected incentives due to increased supply constraints, shifts in customer behavior, and the evolving impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, it became clear that we had to make an unusually large change in estimate in Q3. Now let me turn to segment performance. In Q3, Personal Systems revenue was $10.4 billion flat year-over-year as supply chain challenges continued to constrain our growth. Demand for our products remains strong with backlog increasing again sequentially, despite substantially clearing the Chrome backlog. Drilling into the details, Consumer and Commercial revenue was up 3% and down 1% respectively. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, up 1% for desktops, and down 9% for workstations. Total units were flat year-over-year. We also drove double-digit growth in both consumer peripherals and services attach across consumer and commercial. Personal Systems delivered $869 million and operating profit and operating margins of 8.4%. The operating margin improved by 2.9 points primarily due to favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives and currency partially offset by higher costs, including commodity costs, investments in innovation, and go-to-market, and variable compensation. In Print, our results reflected a continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both Consumer and Commercial and had the hardware, supply, and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q3 total Print revenue was $4.9 billion, up 24% driven by strong growth in supply, hardware, and services. Total hardware units declined 4% due to manufacturing and component constraints, primarily in consumer printers. We expect these Q3 constraints to impact Q4 as well. Our customer segment consumer revenue was up 15% with units down 8% and commercial revenue and units were up 46% and 29%, respectively. Consumer demand remained strong. However, revenue, particularly A4 Laser, was constrained by supply and factory disruptions. The commercial recovery continued with a double-digit hardware revenue growth in office, and triple-digit increases in industrial printing hardware. Given what we're seeing with the Delta variant and evolving hybrid models, we still expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion. The 20% year-on-year growth was driven by inventory replenishment, stronger commercial demand, and favorable pricing. Our contractual business is a key element of our Print strategy in both consumer and commercial printing. In consumer, our Instant Ink business model continued to resonate well with customers with strong double-digit revenue and subscriber growth. On the commercial side, we drove growth in managed Print Services revenue and total contract value with particular strength in new TCP bookings. Print operating profit increased $377 million to $857 million, and operating margins were 17.6%. Operating margin grew 5.4 points, driven primarily by favorable pricing, including the reduction in estimated incentives, higher volumes in commercial hardware, including graphics and 3D, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs, including commodity costs, investments and innovation, and go-to-market, and variable compensation. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continue to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. Our hybrid work strategy is one example. It has enabled us to accelerate our location strategy while providing a more flexible workspace. Going forward, we are enabling HP's hybrid work strategy by monetizing our sites to be critical hubs for collaboration and innovation. This will also deliver savings to our real estate portfolio. In addition to our progress on our location strategy, we're making progress in our digital transformation. We are enhancing and leveraging our digital capabilities to transform the ways we operate and deliver value to our customers. In the third quarter, we completed the initial deployment of our SAP S/4Hana System, one of the largest ERP implementations. Also, as part of our end-to-end business planning and forecasting efforts, we also went live with our new cloud-based platform, which we believe will improve our forecasting agility as part of our digital transformation. The structural cost savings from those transformation efforts are a key enabler of re-investing in our business for long-term growth and profitability. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation, third-quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $1.1 billion and $1 billion respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 29 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle improved one day as higher days payable outstanding more than offset the increased days of inventory due to growth in inventory across PS and Print, and the one-day increase in days sales outstanding. For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, which represented 178% of free cash flow. This included $1.5 billion in share repurchase and $230 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares at elevated levels of at least $1.5 billion in Q4. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we continue to navigate supply availability and logistics constraints, pricing dynamics, and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. For Personal Systems, we continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in Commercial. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumers, and a mix shift as Commercial continues to improve. For both Personal Systems and Print, we expect that component shortage, as well as some manufacturing port and transit disruptions, will continue to constrain revenue due to the ongoing pandemic and resurgence driven by the Delta variant. Taking these considerations into account, we are increasing our Q4 and FY'21 EPS. We expect fourth-quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90 and fourth quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect full-year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.69 to $3.75. And FY'21 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.56 to $3.62. For FY'21, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Matt Cabral: Yes, thank you very much. I wanted to start off on the PC side. It's a really strong operating margin, especially relative to just how you were talking about that business 90 days ago. It sounds like a lot of that was the reduction in estimated incentives. Curious if there's any way to quantify that impact, and just if there are any other swing factors to call out. And then going forward, just curious for your perspective on the sustainability of margin data above the longer-term range versus the need for some normalization beyond that point.
Marie Myers: Hey, Matt, good afternoon, and thanks for the opportunity. Why don't I heap -- unpack your question? I'll start on the outlook for PS for Q4, and then I'll flip over and give you an update on the change in estimated incentive impact on margin. So, with respect to our PS rate outlook, we have strong confidence in our Q4 operating profit and margin outlook. So far to date, we're really pleased with our PS operating margins to date, and overall, we expect that PS will be well above our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% in Q4. So, think about it in terms of being similar to half-one levels, and we'll talk more about that when we get to Sam. Now to address your question with respect to the change in incentive, in terms of the impact on PS margin with respect to OP quarter-on-quarter, the net impact of the reduction in the previously estimated sales and marketing incentive was approximately about a point and a half. And we're talking about that net of investments. And I'll turn it to Enrique now.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Marie. Let me address your question about sustainability. I think a very important thing to understand about this quarter is the strength of the demand that we are seeing. Demand continues to be significantly stronger than our supply chain capacity, backlog grew quarter-over-quarter, and this is really driven by the trends that we have been describing before. The hybrid world is opening and driving opportunities for us to continue to sell PCs. There is a very strong demand for PC for people working from home, and we expect that to continue. So, as we saw strong demand in Q4 -- in Q3, we expect to see strong demand in Q4 and to continue through 2022.
Matt Cabral: Perfect. And then maybe building on that last answer, Enrique, you mentioned confidence in EPS growth next year. I'm sure we'll hear a lot more at Sam, but just curious if you can give us a preview of the biggest drivers underneath there? And just how dependent it is on that sustainability of demand or your revenue trajectory versus maybe other levers you have to pull?
Enrique Lores: So, we continue to see a lot of opportunities across the Company, both in PC, in Printing, in the new businesses we are creating. And as you said, we will be having our Investor Day in a few weeks from now, and we will be setting all the details about next year at that point.
Operator: Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. Can I just ask one question and that's kind of on the PC side? There's a lot of investor questions about the peaking of the PC cycle and what we're starting to see post the big boost on year-over-year a year ago, big sales. Can you give us some color about your orders, your outlook? It sounds like there is a hand-off going on from consumer to enterprise-strength if I heard you correctly, and therefore probably less strength in Chromebooks. Am I getting that right? And the installed base has been healthily way above 300 million units per year on this run rate. Do you think we're going to stay up there or go down quite a bit? That's the big debate. Thank you so much.
Enrique Lores: Let me try to go one by one. First of all, like I was mentioning before, during the quarter, we continued to see very strong demand for PCs driven by the trends that I described. What we saw was that when we finish the quarter, our backlog order that we had that one customer wanted us to ship was significantly larger than what it was at the beginning of a quarter. And what we saw is very strong demand from both commercial and consumer categories. In both cases, we saw increase of demand. The area you were mentioning where we saw some weakness was on the Chromebook space, because many, and it was mostly in the U.S. because many school districts decided to stop their purchase activities until they had clarity on what type of new funds they were going to be getting from the federal government and the timing of those funds. But now, this has been clarified, we expect that now demand on the education space on Chromebooks will pick up at the end of this quarter or at the beginning of next quarter. But in any case, very strong demand on the PC side, faster growth from the commercial, but very strong growth from the consumer.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I also wanted to just follow up on PCs. With the question being, why do you appear to be facing supply and logistic constraints that are significantly more pronounced than your competitors? Dell just reported PC growth of 27%, yours was 0, Lenovo had very strong growth. HP had been a perennial share gainer, and I think it's lost share in PCs. Three out of the last five quarters, or four out of the last five quarters. Why are these constraints so unique to HP? And then related to that, you express confidence in the backlog, but the Chromebook backlog was enormous, 1 or 2 quarters ago, and it's completely gone. And so, what makes the certainty of your conviction in the sustainability of your backlog in PCs for commercial and consumers different from Chromebook?
Enrique Lores: Hi Tony. Let me also go one by one. On the PC side, what we saw is, we clearly have some areas where we need to improve operationally to be able to optimize our performance given the delta between supply and demand. And there are 3 areas where specifically we need to -- we are working and we need to do some more work. First of all, as you know, we have an outsourced model, where the majority of our production is managed by ODM. This means that those ODMs we were managing until now, the relationship with the providers of the components that we are missing. We have been thinking that signing now direct relationship and direct supply agreements with them, so this is addressing that gap. Second, the important factor is one of the key things of our PC business is the breadth of our portfolio. We lead both in consumer and commercial. But this portfolio has not been designed to optimize for a low-cost component which is what we are missing now. We have been changing that, and as you will -- as we will introduce our new progress going forward, you will see an increase of leverage of components across multiple products, so we can really optimize our digitalization of components. And third, as Marie mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have been working to deploy a new ERP system, that the ERP system is now in place, and now we have the ability to create tools that will help us to optimize the allocation of orders, not only based on business priorities, but also on components availability. And this is something that until now because we were in the middle of the ERP team, we had to do it manually. When I look at all these three areas, explain kind of the improvement that you are going to see on this site and give us confidence on how we will continue to optimize our -- how we manage the current situation. Then the second part of your question around Chromebooks, I think that an important factor to realize is that during the quarter, we closed the backlog because the shipments of Chromebooks were 100% higher than shipments that we made before. When we look at the backlog that is left, we analyze it customer-by-customer, retailer-by-retailer, partner-by-partner, and this gives us very strong confidence on the value and the solidity of that backlog. If we will look at cancellations, with the exception of Chromebook coming from some of the changes in the U.S. school district, we are not seeing cancellations of the backlog, and as we mentioned before, it is more than one full quarter of demands, what we have in backlog.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. Just my final question is, you did say you were going to grow revenues in fiscal '22, you did not say you were going to grow revenues in fiscal '22. Are you confident you will grow revenues in fiscal '22?
Enrique Lores: As I said before, we're going to be having our Investor Day in a few weeks from now, and that will be the right time to have all the conversations about fiscal year '22. Thank you, Toni.
Operator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 as well, I guess. The first one, Enrique, maybe you can talk about the Print business a little bit. It continues to perform really well; I think supplies were up 19%, 20%. I think the struggle that everyone is having though is what does profit normalization look like as supplies growth starts to moderate back to the long-term averages. So, I'd love to understand, do you think there are structural changes in place within supplies, within Print actually, that ensure that even if supply starts to slow down, you can sustain the high-teens margins you've been seeing over the last few quarters.
Enrique Lores: Thank you. So first of all, in terms of the supply’s performance, we are really pleased with the performance that we saw this quarter. Though we need to accept that the 20% growth is also coming because we had an easy comparison to last year. But again, we are pleased with the performance of our supplies. In terms of what do we see happening, basically, the trends that we shared before. As offices are reopening, we are starting to see an increase in growth on the toner side, on the office side, and at the same time, we are starting to see sunlight slow down on the consumer side, which again, was what we were expecting. And in any case, the consumer business today continues to be above the projections that we had for this time before the pandemic started. And this is a structural change that has happened. Additionally, that, we have been able to accelerate the transition of our business model both rebalance in profitability, but also significantly growing our subscription businesses. And this gives us strong confidence about the evolution of the business going forward, but also in terms of protecting our supply shares because more and more customers are part of a subscription program, we will make sure that they continue to use HP supplies.
Marie Myers: To add to Enrique's comments there, right now, our channel is where we want it to be. So, going into Q4, we're not expecting any channel replenishment at this stage either, Amit.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. Thank you very much. And then, Marie, maybe a follow-up with you. On the free cash flow dynamics on your Inventory Day, you talked on that a little bit, a bit of a wide ramped up so much. How do you see that normalizing back into the October quarter? Does it normalize in October? Does it stay elevated, I guess longer-term? And what do you need to see as a Company to take in leverage back up to, I think, two times debt-to-EBITDA that you talked about a year ago or so to exclude the bilateral products?
Marie Myers: Yes. Look, no worries. I mean, and I think I got the first part of your question. I'll address your comments on inventory. And quite rightly, so you said that inventory is elevated this quarter, and that's really due to strategic assurance of supply. Look, we expect that it's frankly going to remain higher than pre-COVID levels. But look, we might see some adjustments quarter-on-quarter as we drive and meet customers' needs. We're in a pretty dynamic environment as we speak here. Now to address the second part of your question on leverage, right now, our gross debt to EBITDA is about 1.17, which is -- it's below our stated goal of getting towards 1.5 to 2. And look, we continue -- we expect to reach that lower end of the range over time, but right now, given our strong earnings and free cash flow performance, it's going to be a couple of quarters. But I might just add that we are really proud of the job that we've done around capital allocation. I think you heard in my prepared remarks that we said we plan to purchase back at least $1.5 billion in shares in the quarter. Enrique, I might just turn it over to you for any closing comments.
Enrique Lores: Well, maybe a couple of comments. I think it's important to remember that we are really -- and we stay very committed to aggressively return capital to our shareholders and our actions during the last quarter reflect that. As we mentioned, we have returned this quarter $1.7 billion to shareholders. which is 178% of free cash flow and since the value plan started, we have bought 20% of our outstanding shares. So, a really strong commitment to that. We, during Q4, are going to be buying at least $1.5 billion, so we are continuing with that. And during The Analyst Day, we will share what our plans for '22 are. But you can expect from our very strong focus on continue buying back and dividends.
Operator: The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Katy Huberty: Yes. Thank you. Marie, can you help us understand what the catalyst was to change the sales and marketing incentives in the quarter because that was a big surprise, and at face value, it almost looks like it was a reaction to operational execution and shortfalls, but maybe that wasn't the case. And specifically, is this an accrual change, or is it an actual change in the level of payments that you were making in the quarter? And should we think about this new level as a new structural level, or will this recover as you come out of COVID? And then I have a follow-up.
Marie Myers: Yes. Good afternoon, Katy. So why don't I explain to you -- just walk you through this change in estimates, then I'll address your question specifically around the accrual and the reserves. So, we typically look at these estimates every quarter. So, we estimate our sales and marketing incentives based on a number of different factors. So, for example, historical experience, expected customer behavior, acceptance rates, and a very important driver is market conditions, which as you know, we've experienced a lot of volatility since the COVID-19 pandemic began. It's also worth noting that some of these programs take several months, from 6 months to 12 months for partners to claim. With the impact of these market dynamics combined with the lower claims that we've seen from our partners, it became clear that we had to make this unusually large change in estimate in Q3. And frankly, we don't expect future changes of this size. But if it changes, we'll make the appropriate disclosures. Now, typically reserves, just to answer your question, you asked me about the reserve, and then I'll address your structural components. Reserves are typically liabilities for estimated future payments. A reserve can occur for a variety of reasons, one of those can actually be a change in estimate. And in terms of structure, as you know, we have in place a transformation plan. We are expecting it to be at 35%, of about $1.2 billion plan. And we're always looking for opportunities to drive efficiency in our pricing, and we've been very effective, actually, in pricing for the current market environment as you see in the results that we've delivered. Certainly, in terms of structure, we're looking for opportunities to continually improve our pricing and our ability to price effectively in this dynamic period.
Katy Huberty: Thank you for that color. And just as a follow-up, historically, revenue increases 5% to 7% sequentially in October. Is normal seasonality a reasonable expectation given that you're coming from the lower base of revenue in 3Q, given some of the execution issues that need to be addressed, or will it take longer to fix, for instance, this shortfall you saw on PCs in international markets and we shouldn't necessarily be assuming normal seasonality? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Let me take that question, Katy. And I think we need to realize that we are in a very different situation than before the pandemic. Usually, our business is demand-driven, and therefore there is some seasonality driven by buying patterns. Today, our business is totally driven by supply. As I said before, orders exceed significantly what we can produce, and therefore, normal seasonality doesn't apply to a year like this. Because what we will be shipping is not what we will be getting orders for, it's going to be what is the maximum amount of product that we can produce every day, every week, every month.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. My first question is just with regard to underlying trends in Print volumes. And if you can talk about what you're seeing, consumer Soho and the office. And maybe if you can talk about -- within regions that are either I guess returning to the office or reversing course, just to get some ideas of what you're seeing with the data that you get. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Shannon. The trends that we are seeing are aligned with the trends that we were expecting to see a quarter ago. We are starting to see recovery in the office side, though I have to say that that recovery is uneven, and if it's impacted by the evolution of the pandemic and certain countries when they are hit, we see offices close again and then we see an impact there. But the trend is positive in terms of office growth. And we see faster growth from the SMB side than on the enterprise side. When I say growth, I mean recovery. On the other side, on the home side, again, as we were expecting, we are starting to see a slowdown as kids are starting to go back to schools in many countries, and the balance of work between home and office is also changing. Again, it is what we were expecting, and in any case, what we see today and the projections that we have now, continue to be above the projections that we have before the pandemic.
Shannon Cross: And as a clarification, can you say you're at 80% or 85% of where you were printing? And then my -- [Indiscernible]. And my second question is with regard to acquisitions, especially if you're going to start to see some revenue pressure next year given some of the strength you've seen in PCs this year, where are you at with regard to acquisitions? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: In terms of deviation versus the number of pages printed, I gave you a question, it's in the office. It goes between minus 15 and minus 25 or minus 20 something between SMB and enterprise. We're still below what we were to -- where we want to be, but this gives you some ranges. And then in terms of acquisitions, M&A continues to be part of our plan. We have a rigorous framework to analyze the opportunities that we see based on returns, based on alignment and strategy, based on our ability to execute, we are constantly evaluating opportunities in our core businesses, in adjacencies to support our new growth strategies. And this quarter, we had two great examples that show how do we approach and how do we think about M&A. We closed the HyperX deal that is really allowing us to accelerate our growth into the peripheral space. And now we have a leading position in peripherals for gaming. And we did also a very exciting opportunity in the services space with the acquisition of Teradici Corporation that will allow us to integrate into our services Remote Compute for highly complex environments, which many of our customers are utilizing today. So, M&A is part of our plan and we are executing on that when we see the right opportunity.
Operator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys, for squeezing me in. So, I just wanted to go back, Enrique, to the backlog. Can you give us a little bit more granularity on sort of the mix? I know you mentioned that the Chromebook -- part of the backlog had come down pretty dramatically. But any more color on what that mix might look like given where the margin strength came in in the quarter, so it's a little bit surprising. And then obviously it sounds like you think Chromebooks are going to come back a little bit into the mix. How do you think about sort of order growth from a Chromebook perspective relative to where the backlog is today? What I mean by that is, so when you think about the October quarter should backlog given the supply constraints tick up again given your commentary, or do you think we're at reasonable equilibrium despite the supply chain -- the supply chain constraints from a demand perspective? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me address some of your points. So first of all, the first important factor is backlog grew during the quarter. So, we ended the quarter with a higher backlog than what we had when the quarter started. The mix of the backlog was different. As I said before, we basically fulfilled all the orders that we had with Chromebooks. But the rest of the commercial business and consumers grew significantly. And today, when we closed the quarter, more than 60% of the backlog was coming from commercial customers, which is where margins are higher and where we -- and this is really an important factor to have in mind. As we look at the future, we expect the Chromebook business to accelerate again at the end of Q3 and at the end of Q4. But I think it's important to have in mind that Chromebook represents around 10% of our total PC business, even slightly below that. So, it's a relatively small business for us. What I really want to highlight is the strength of the Commercial business, which really is driven by companies reopening, offices being reopened, and investments that corporations are doing and SMBs are doing in improving their working experience for their employees.
David Vogt: And then that's helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe just a follow-up from Marie along those lines. I know you mentioned Q4 margins will be more likely to resemble 1.5 margins in the Personal Systems group. Is that the right way to think about it in terms of Commercial margins are above where we are now and Chromebooks, as it comes back into the mix into Q4, are slightly diluted to margins? And that's how we think about that step-down from 3Q into 4Q, and then into 2022, enterprise or commercial is still relatively strong. Should we be expecting margins in PSG to be above your normal historical 3.5% to 5.5% range? Thanks.
Marie Myers: Yeah. So, going into Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we expect PS to be well above our long-term range of 3.5 to 5.5. So just think about it in terms of being similar to the sort of half-one levels and to your comment about Chrome; yes, Chrome margins are usually more diluted to PS now. In terms of '22 and how to think about '22 margins, we're going to talk more about that in terms of the mid and long-term at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. So, I will look forward to seeing you then.
Operator: And our last question today is from Ananda Baruah with Luke Capital. Please go ahead.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Take 2, if I could. Enrique, just to the remarks you made a few moments ago. If back-to-office gets meaningfully delayed as we go through the fall here, how should we think about the impact of the PC and the printing business? And in that, if the demand for back-to-office PCs is put on hold to any extent, do you think that there could be a switch back to -- is there PC demand still at the home that would need to be satiated? And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks so much.
Enrique Lores: I think that the backlog that we have when the quarter starts is so high -- when I say the backlog is close to one full quarter, this gives you the magnitude of the orders that we haven't been able to fulfill. I think in the short term, really, we are very protected from any deviations versus the [Indiscernible] plans. So, I don't think this will have any big impact from that perspective, Ananda. And what we are seeing is, especially on the PC side, we have not seen a big implication of the offices reopening or not, because more corporations realize that they need to invest in improving the experience for their employees and we are seeing very strong demand across the board.
Ananda Baruah: That's really helpful. And then I guess the second one is, the actions that you described, Enrique, with regard to the comments about being under-indexed on the share, and you had talked about the execution al dynamics, outsourced model, components being optimized across SKUs, the ERP system. When do you believe that those actions collectively can start to make an impact that will show up in the P&L? And I'm assuming that also you're suggesting that it will lead to share reversion as well.
Enrique Lores: Well, I think in terms of the actions, we have been working on them for a couple of quarters now, and they will have an impact gradually during the next month. This is really more about how do we optimize our performance within the COVID-contained environment. We shouldn't expect that we are going to be able to double our capacity because there are significant shortages of components, but it will have a gradual improvement in our performance, especially when we look at it competitively. And I'm not sure if I understand your comment about share repurchase. We are fully committed to continuing to repurchase stock. We announced that during Q4, we will be buying at least $1.5 billion of shares, and during the analyst's meeting, we will share what are the plans for 2022. Thank you. And I think that was the last question, so let me close by saying thank you to everybody for participating. As you have seen during the call, we remain very optimistic about the opportunities that the new way of working that the hybrid world is opening for us, and we are making very good progress executing our strategy. We continue to see very strong demand. And in the short term, our results are going to be impacted by component availability. It's not a demand-driven world, it's a supply-driven world. In this world, our ability to drive financial results is very strong. We are confident in the future, and this is why we raised guidance for the year, and for Q4 to reflect the confidence that we have in the business. And as we said, we are looking forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in October. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q2  (2021-05-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Second Quarter 2021 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is [Hailey] and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Howe: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to HP's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of this webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately one year.

For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. With that I'd like to turn it over to Enrique.
Enrique Lores: Thanks Beth. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining the call. I want to start by acknowledging the state of the pandemic, particularly in countries such as India. We are doing everything we can for our employees, customers, and partners during this difficult time. While some parts of the world are beginning to improve and reopen, there is much more work to do. Turning to our results, it was another exceptional quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth in which we delivered well above our guided range. Our performance reflects the relevance of our technology in an increasingly high level, the resilience of our business model, and the operational excellence of our team. In addition to summarizing our results, I also want to highlight secular trends driving sustained demand across our portfolio. HP technology and services are at the heart of hybrid [ph] work. We are accelerating our strategy to drive long-term sustainable growth. This includes continuing to transform the way we operate and deploy our substantial cash flow to maximize value creation. Let me start with the quarter. In Q2, we saw exceptional demand for our products and delivered record revenue of $15.9 billion, an increase of 27% with balanced growth across Print and Personal Systems. Our non-GAAP net earnings increased 56% to $1.2 billion, and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, returning $1.8 billion to shareholders. These results reflect continued strong growth in consumer as well as improvement in our commercial businesses as economic activity increased. In our consumer segment, we delivered 72% growth in Personal Systems and 77% growth in Print. Commercial PC revenue grew 10% and Commercial Print was up 34%, including 45% growth in our Industrial printing businesses. It is important to note that these results are against the backdrop of industry-wide component shortages and supply chain challenges. Currently there is not enough supply to keep up with the robust demand, and the resurgence of COVID in Southeast Asia is creating additional pressures on our supply chain. We expect supply constraints to continue at least through the end of 2021. Although the environment will likely remain dynamic, we are taking actions to navigate through the challenges, enabling us to deliver strong results and increase our outlook for the second half. As we remain focused on delivering in the short-term, we are equally focused on capitalizing on attractive long-term opportunities. It is clear that the world will not simply go back to the way it was prior to COVID. There has been a fundamental shift in the way people work, learn, play, and create, and this shift is here to stay. The future of work and education will be more hybrid. According to recent survey, more than 60% of employees want flexibility in where and how they work. By this future merger [ph], it will open the opportunity to create new products and services for our customers. And as consumers and businesses see greater mobility, convenience, and value, this supports our strategy to accelerate new business model here through more services and subscriptions enabled by the integration of our hardware and software. Underpinning all of this is a growing importance of cybersecurity. 88% of IT decision makers tell us a war with [ph] cyber risk has increased during the pandemic. This presents a huge opportunity for us to expand our security offerings and deliver the most secure and resilient PCs and Printers. With our broad differentiated portfolio, HP is uniquely positioned to capitalize on these secular trends. And I think I've said this is a time for strong companies to get stronger and we are innovating across our portfolio to strengthen and grow our businesses. In Personal Systems, our innovation is driving growth in key segments, including remote work, education, and gaming. The PC continues to be essential in daily life. We are already capitalizing on these trends in a number of ways. Our latest award winning PC’s include features purpose-built for hybrid work, and we are developing new services like HP Provision in Connect that make it easier for IT teams to set up and support devices in employee's homes as well as in the office. In the education market where HP is the number one vendor, PC sales have more than doubled due to remote learning. At the same time, however, the number of PCs per hundred students remains in the single digits. As an industry, we still have a long way to go to close this digital device; and as a company, we have a big opportunity to be part of the solution. The importance of the PC extends far beyond work and school. In many cases, this has become the entertainment center of the home from streaming and content creation to the rise of gaming and eSports. In Q2, revenue growth in gaming outpaced overall consumer PC growth. We are building on this strength to expand into attractive adjacencies, including peripherals. We are on track to close a hyper acquisition in Q3. We do expect to be accretive in year one. In Printers, we are leveraging our leadership across consumer and commercial market to provide innovative solutions needed in today's hybrid world. This includes accelerating the evolution of our business model and subscription services. We recently announced the expansion of HP+ an Instant Ink, which are now in 35 countries across North America and Europe. We believe HP+ will help us to optimize system profitability and provide a better customer experience. Additionally, employers are looking for more distributed printing environment, which plays to HP's strength in [indiscernible]. The new LaserJet Enterprise 400 series is designed to deliver seamless remote management for both hybrid workers and new office configurations [steered] to our collaboration. At the same time, greater workforce mobility is a catalyst for our Print Services portfolio. Within our managed Print Services, we have introduced HP Flexworker Service to incorporate remote workers and branch officers into our company and PS contract. This is allowing companies such as General Motors to have better visibility and manageability across the printer fleet. In our Industrial businesses, new innovation is enabling production to be more agile and more personalized. In industrial graphics, we are seeing improvements in the market and growth in hardware installations among the customer wins this quarter for the installation of a 100 Indigo Press at CCL, our leader in label security and packaging solutions. We also continue to see consistent double-digit growth in Print impressions and square meters. In 3D, we are creating more vertical go-to-market solutions, spanning equipment software and services across industries from industrial tooling to automotive to health and wellness. For example, our molded fiber tooling solution based on customer engagement and adoption, including numerous prepaid purchases and we enable them to achieve significant process and cost efficiencies. In addition, we are partnering with Ford Motor Company to extend the life of already used 3D printed parts by turning them into auto components for the F250 trucks creating a closed [loop on waste]. With our strong and diverse portfolio, we also continue to generate meaningful free cash flow. And we remain focused on deploying our cash to maximize value creation. We have the flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in our businesses, while also exploring disciplined M&A. We will continue to look for opportunities to strengthen our core, expanding to attractive adjacencies and create additional growth engine. As always, we will take a rigorous approach to evaluating M&A, requiring strategic fit, attractive financial returns that exceed those of buying our own stock and a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition. And an important enabler of our strategy is continuing to transform the company to become leaner and more digitally enabled. For HP, there is a continued focus on both reducing structural costs and for investing for the future. To help us accelerate our progress, we announced three new leadership appointments. Didier Deltort is joining HP as a President of Personalization and 3D Printing; Greg Baxter, will be our next Chief Transformation Officer; and Kristen Ludgate is joining HP as our Chief People Officer. Working together with our leadership team, they will strengthen our innovation capabilities and help drive our long-term strategy. And our key part of our strategy is to deliver strong results while staying true to HP's values. Last month, we announced an ambitious set of climate action goals. By 2025, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality, zero waste in HP operations and zero deforestation for HP paper and paper-based packaging. We're also committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 2040. And last week, we announced a new set of diversity and inclusion goals. This includes our pledge to achieve 50-50 gender equality in HP leadership by 2030, making us the first Fortune 100 tech company to make such a commitment. I am proud to say our partners are joining us in these efforts. Today, over 1,400 partners have signed the Amplify Impact to set their own long-term objective to drive a sustainable impact. This is where the size and scale of HP's ecosystem truly shines. Overall, I am very pleased with our performance this quarter and excited for what lies ahead. We continue to drive our relentless focus on execution, while taking decisive actions to capitalize on attractive opportunities to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print, expand into attractive adjacencies, disrupt new market, and transform the way we operate. And I am confident that our strategy will continue to create significant shareholder value. I know I speak for our more than 50,000 employees, when I say we are not content simply maintaining our current position. We have a much bigger ambition. And with that, I will turn the call over to Marie, who will take you through the details of our quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you.
Marie Myers: Thanks, Enrique. HP's second quarter results highlight both our operational strength and the breadth of our portfolio. We are demonstrating our ability to meet customer needs and continuing on our transformation journey all while growing operating profit, generating strong free cash flow and maintaining our robust capital returns, while continuing to make investments in the company for our future. Turning to the details of the second quarter. Q2 net revenue was $15.9 billion, up 27% nominally and 25% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 32%, EMEA increased 19%, and APJ increased 23%. The year-on-year growth rate benefited from the prior-year impact of COVID and supply chain disruptions. Demand continued to outpace supply and we ended the quarter with elevated backlog in both Personal Systems and Printing. At the highest since the split, gross margin was 21.7%, up 1.7 points year-on-year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable pricing, including historically low promotion expense and favorable currency, partially offset by higher costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2 billion or 12.6% of revenue, up 10 basis points year-on-year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by higher variable compensation as a result of the very strong performance this year as compared to Q2 2020, as well as increased investments in innovation and go-to-market. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $64 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 82% to $0.93, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.2 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes net benefits totaling $70 million, primarily related to other tax adjustments and non-operating retirement related credits, partially offset by restructuring and other charges, as well as amortization of intangible assets. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.98. Turning to segment performance. In Q2, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home. Revenue was $10.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Demand for our product remained very strong with backlog increasing again quarter-on-quarter. Drilling into the details, we saw strength across consumer and commercial with revenue up 72% and 10% respectively. By product category, revenue was up 47% for notebooks, down 8% for desktops, and down 7% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 44% with Chromebooks representing 20% of our total Personal Systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. We also saw solid services attach with particular strength in commercial and significant double-digit growth in consumer peripherals. Personal Systems delivered $710 million in operating profit and operating margins of 6.7%. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to favorable pricing, including lower promotion expenses, as well as currency, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher cost, including variable compensation, commodity costs, as well as investments in innovation and go-to-market. In Print, our results reflected continued focus on execution and the strength of our portfolio. We are uniquely positioned as leaders in both consumer and commercial and have the hardware supplies and services to deliver value in a hybrid world. Q2 total print revenue was $5.3 billion, up 28% and total hardware units grew 42% to [$10.6 billion]. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 77% with units up 45% and Commercial revenue and units were up 34% and 22% respectively. In Commercial, the recovery momentum continued with revenue up 13% sequentially, but we continue to expect the recovery to be gradual and uneven at times across segments and geographies. Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, up 17%. The year-on-year growth was primarily driven by favorable pricing, as well as ongoing consumer demand and improving commercial demand. Our contractual business is a key element of our print strategy in both Consumer and Commercial printing. In Consumer our Instant Ink business continue to resonate well with customers with cumulative enrollees growing 7% sequentially to 9.7 million. On the Commercial side, we drove growth in managed print services revenues, a new TCP bookings for the first time since the pandemic took hold and strong renewal TCP bookings again this quarter. Operating profit increased $403 million to $951 million and operating margins were 17.9%. This year-over-year increase was driven by increased volume and favorable pricing across hardware and supplies, including less promotional expense, partially offset by unfavorable mix and higher costs. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings initiatives. In the second year of our program, we continued to look at new cost savings opportunities and remain ahead of our $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued our efforts to optimize our factory footprint to enable a best-in-class supply chain network and enhance supply resiliency, while reducing our cost structure. In addition, we continue to enhance and leverage our digital capabilities to transform ways in which we operate and deliver value to our customers. The structural cost savings from our transformation efforts give us the flexibility to reinvest in our business, the long-term growth and profitability. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Second quarter cash flow from operations and free cash flow were better than expected at $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion respectively. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 28 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was up 2 days as growth in inventory primarily due to strategic buys drove increased days of inventories, partially offset by a reduction in days sales outstanding and higher days payable outstanding. For the quarter, we returned a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders, which represented 137% of free cash flow. This included $1.6 billion in share repurchases and $239 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher return opportunities emerge. Looking forward to the third quarter and the rest of fiscal 2021, we continue to model multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic reopening. In particular, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. From a demand perspective, we expect to continue to see strong demand for our PCs, particularly in consumer. In Print, we expect solid demand in consumer and continued improvement in commercial as offices reopen. While we expect year-on-year revenue growth in FY 2021 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note the growth trends in Q3 will also reflect the tougher year-over-year comparisons, particularly in Personal Systems. We expect supply constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand in PCs and Printers, at least through the end of calendar 2021. We expect gross margin pressure in the second half of the year in both Personal Systems and Print due to increased costs and commodities and logistics as compared to Q2 levels and as we expect to see some more normalization in the market and pricing environment. We expect operating expenses in the second half of the year to be more similar to Q1 run rate. Finally, we continue to closely monitor the current COVID resurgence and its potential impact to our supply chain, particularly in Southeast Asia. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q3 and FY 2021. We expect third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.85 and third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.77 to $0.81. We expect FY 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50 and FY 2021 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.24 to $3.34. For FY 2021, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have a few. The first one I guess was hoping if you could talk a little bit about the Print margins in the April quarter. I'm somewhat surprised they were down on a sequential basis by nearly 200 basis points even though the supply mix I think was fairly stable in July versus April. So, could you maybe just touch on what happened to the Print margins in the April quarter, and how do we think about it in the back half of the year?
Marie Myers: Sure. No. Thanks, Amit and good afternoon. So the decline we saw in the Print operating rate was really driven by several factors. So first of all, some of the unfavorable cost in commodities, factory, and logistics and secondly by investments that we made in OpEx across R&D, marketing to support future growth and higher variable comp. And look, overall I'd just say we have seen strength and resiliency in our Print portfolio, which really positions us well against the competition. And as we look ahead into the future, we do expect our margins to be in the long-term range of 16% to 18%. And let me give you just a few things to think about as you think about the second half. So, obviously, the full year was very strong in the first half. So, we expect to be toward the higher end of the range. And just a couple of other points I would add is, some of the exceptional benefit that we saw in H1, particularly in favorable pricing will start to diminish. And so, we would expect that our mix as well would normalize as the office reopens. We're likely to see higher commodity cost, logistics costs, and that will potentially impact our ability to meet demand. And then finally, there is some seasonal mix headwinds in Q2 as – in supplies as Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for supplies. So, just keep that in mind, as you're thinking about the second half, and I'll just conclude that we're in the business of generating incremental OP dollars.
Enrique Lores: I think a key point for our performance for Print this quarter is that we are really pleased of how the Print business did. Whether if you look at year-on-year comparison, whether you look at growth, it is really aligned to the trends that we described last quarter, the rebalancing that we see happening between home and office, the growth that we are starting to see in some of the commercial and industrial categories. So Print had a very strong quarter and we expect it to continue through the rest of the year.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That is really helpful. And then if I could just follow-up in comparable dynamic really, Enrique I think a big focus for everyone is trying to understand what does steady state EPS look like for HP over time, especially given the strong performance you've had in the first half, and I think your back half guide sort of implies EPS will decline high-single digits 10% plus in Q3 and Q4. I'm curious, I know you touched on Print, but I’m curious what are the other vectors that are driving the slowdown in EPS, especially given the fact you're elevated backlog? And then do you think the $0.75, $0.80 implied EPS in October quarter is a representation of what normal EPS run rate is going to look like for HP?
Enrique Lores: Yes, so first of all, let me talk about the year-on-year comparison how we put things in perspective. EPS for the second half is growing more than 40% from where we were a year ago. So, we're really representing very solid growth. At the same time as you are saying, we continue to see very strong demand across all of our portfolio. We expect this to continue to happen through the second half, but we are going to be limited by supply, given the shortages that we see in the market. And this is a fundamental part of what is driving our guide. As we have done in the past, we are prudent when we guide, we have been in the past and we will continue to be. If we can do better, we will, we could be there better because of better pricing, because we could do better, because of better capacity. So, again prudent guide, we have demonstrated that if we can do better we will do better, and therefore given all the anomalies that we see and this supply constrained, I don't think we should be using the Q4 number to project the business in the future.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. I had a question on inventory, both on your balance sheet and then within the channel. Up about $800 million quarter-over-quarter, I'm curious, how much of that was component buying or maybe some end product just given supply chain hiccups? And then Lenovo said today, I think that they see two to three weeks of channel inventory on PCs usually, I can't remember I think it was six to eight weeks is their normal. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the channel and both on the PC and the printer side? And then I've a follow-up. Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Let me start and I think maybe before Marie shares some of the numbers, let me share some of the strategy that we have behind it. What we shared last quarter, that we were anticipating some of the supply challenges that we are seeing, we decided to operate with higher levels of HOI and this is what you see reflected in the numbers. So, Marie why don't you give some color on whether the increases we see in HOI?
Marie Myers: Yes. No, absolutely, Enrique. So, let me step back and set some context for you Shannon. So obviously, we've seen that strong demand across peers in Print. And as you know, we're also lapping the factory closures and disruptions from those inventory drawdowns last year and obviously that impacted the system all the way through. And then we're obviously trying to continue to navigate the supply chain challenges given the ongoing nature of the pandemic. So, to approve assurance of supply, we are carrying higher levels of owned inventory and as we said, we do this to navigate during this time. So, HOI at this point is likely to stay elevated to support business growth. And that includes strategic buys to answer your question, where, particularly in CPUs. And then going on to the second part of your question around channel inventory, overall CI in PS, Print, hardware and supplies is currently below historical levels. And our backlog is up frankly quarter-on-quarter, and that gives us confidence on the demand that we are seeing Shannon.
Shannon Cross: Okay, great. And then just a question on pricing. I think you noted you expect some normalization in pricing, but what we're hearing is prices are somewhat increasing. So, is this more sort of an average price, so mix impact or what are you seeing, because if there is no supply out there and demand remains strong, I don't see where you might not have some pricing pressure, sorry pricing advantage? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Shannon. I think it's worth to go through the pricing discussion business by business. In the case of Print, we are having price increases across the board and you can see in our numbers an increase in the average price. In the case of PCs, pricing rates are growing or price in each category are going up, but overall price is going down because of mix, because of where we are seeing the higher demand in the market. So, prices are up, but because of mix, you may see the average price going down.
Marie Myers: And Shannon just to add to Enrique's comments, some of the favorable pricing that we saw in the benefit in the first half is starting to abate in the second half as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. I just want to – just trying to square the circle on a couple of things, particularly around your guidance. So, seasonally you're typically up in EPS and you're guiding for EPS to be down about 10% sequentially. Revenue is typically up 3% or 4%. Are you suggesting that revenue is going to be lower than normal seasonal or is this all margin pressure? And the reason I struggle with the margin question is, it sounds like your backlog is even bigger. You should be able to sell whatever you have. You have incremental inventory so that should allow you to arguably meet demand better. So, if you're in a situation where people are chasing demand and the mix doesn't fundamentally change, why do you expect pricing to abate? So, I guess a couple of questions in there. One, do you expect an impact to top line that's different from normal seasonal? Or is it all margin in terms of your way below normal seasonal EPS guidance? And then how do we square that margin pressure with the fact that there is really strong demand, you have better inventory to fulfill that demand and you should be able to continue to take price?
Marie Myers: Hey, Toni, good afternoon. It's Marie. So, let me walk you through how to think about our guide and specifically. I'll give you a sense of what the headwinds and the tailwinds are looking like. So, first of all, with respect to your comments on revenue, we do expect that revenue will be driven more by available supply than demand and there are increasing margin headwinds versus the first half. With all that said, as Enrique said right at the onset of the call, we are guiding for double-digit operating profit and EPS growth in Q3. And frankly, we believe that this is a prudent guide in the context of the current environment. Obviously, if we can do better, we always will. But let me walk you through what we're seeing from the headwinds and tailwinds to give you some of that color. So on the headwinds, we are seeing component costs and logistics costs in both PS and Print, and they will be an incremental headwind both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, and those overall basket of commodities, particularly in panel, ICs and PS and then ICs and resins in Print. And then there are the tailwinds that we've had in the first half around those favorable pricing dynamics. They will start to dissipate as we lap the onset of those historically low promotion expenses. And getting into your comments on tailwinds and how we're thinking about it, demand in both PS and Print continue obviously to be very strong as you mentioned. We're seeing those trends of hybrid work continue, but obviously they are constrained by supply. So, you know, and in addition, just to, kind of wrap up here, as we said, we're going to continue to return capital to shareholders. So, we expect that that [repo of] at least about $1 billion a quarter. So for the full-year, we expect PS margins will be slightly above the high end of our longer-term range of 3.5% to 5.5% and Print for the full-year at the higher end of 16% to 18%. So, at this point, we remain very confident of our guide and if we can do better like I said, we will.
Enrique Lores: And I think Toni, something important to having consideration this year, is that really the business and the market is driven by supply, not by demand. So therefore comparing this year with other years based on seasonality, it will not work, because really the dynamics behind the market are very different. What we continue to see is very strong demand across our portfolio and this is really the key driver is how much supply we can get.
Toni Sacconaghi: If I could just follow-up on the pricing dynamics, so, if I look at consumer print ASPs last quarter were up 30%, this quarter were up 27%. If we went to something like zero pricing, it would basically put your operating margins dramatically down in the IPG group. So, I want to understand what is driving this pricing? So, is this purely an absence of discounting? Is this a – we're not building lower end SKUs with lower margin and we're forcing people to take sort of more richly configured consumer printers that have better margin or is it we're actually raising price because we can, because demand is constrained. But obviously 27% ASP growth this quarter, 30% last quarter is helping your economics enormously. As you suggested, it's going to be less, but I want to understand very specifically what is driving that ASP increase?
Enrique Lores: I think Toni we, in a situation like the one we are facing, we are doing anything we can to optimize our business and therefore we are guiding all the actions that you were mentioning. We of course have reduced significantly our promotional discounts, because of how strong the demand is. We are still in demand toward higher margin products and of course, in the cases where we can, also our prices are going up because as we said before, we are seeing – we are living in an inflationary environment and whenever we can we will – we have increased prices.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I heard you mentioned that PC backlog is up sequentially. Is your Print backlog also up versus the first quarter? And then, can you talk about how the makeup of backlog is changing as you go through the year? Is there any shift from consumer to commercial from Chromebook to other PCs and just mix between hardware and supplies? And then I have a follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Let me take that question. Hi, Katy. So, the answer to the first question is, yes. We are seeing an increase in backlog across both PCs and Printers. And in terms of how do we expect this to evolve, is really aligned to where do we see demand coming during the next quarters. As we mentioned before, we expect through the end of the year, an increase in the demand on the commercial side, both on the PC side and also on the Print side, and this is where – because of that, backlog will be moving into this direction. But still we continue to see strong demand on consumer as I mentioned before.
Katy Huberty: Great, thank you. And then PC margins this quarter were a bit lower than the flat sequential guidance. What were the surprises on costs or mix in the quarter? And then should we expect with cost inflation that PC margins return to that roughly 5% range from a couple of years ago?
Marie Myers: Yes, Katy, it's Marie. Hey, good afternoon. So, let me hit up your margin question. So yes, the margins were strong again at 6.7%, which as you know is above the high end of our long-term range and some of that was obviously driven by that strong pricing discipline that we've spoken about, as well as some benefit from currency, but really it was offset by mix and some of those commodity headwinds. And as we get into the full-year, we do expect that margins to be slightly above the high-end of our range of 3.5% to 5.5% and it's going to be driven by the themes that you're hearing today, particularly around those continued shortages in commodities and that's obviously sort of transforming into higher component costs and then knock on cost and logistics. And then I'd finally just add, we are starting to enter a period where the impact of favorable pricing is going to start to diminish as we start to lap that period in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yes, two if I could. First on the Print side, could you talk a little bit about, you mentioned some of the user numbers for the as-a-service offering both for consumer and commercial. It seems like it's, you know pretty steady growth here. Could you talk a little bit about some of the underlying drivers beyond that, maybe usage or anything else that's potentially showing the strength there other than just the user base? And then second, if – you talked about another quarter of very strong Chromebook, could you just talk a little bit about the impacts there on the model margin ASP? And then also as you expect to see a little bit of normalization to PC growth. Is the expectation that the rapid growth in Chromebook will be something that will pull back or do you think that's something that could start replacing other mid and lower tiers of the of the PC segment? Thank you.
Enrique Lores: Many questions in one question. I will try to go one by one. So, starting from Print, for the dynamics we are seeing are very similar to what we explained a quarter ago and the evolution is what we were expecting. Before to pre-pandemic levels, we continue to see our home business to perform better than what we were projecting. And this is driving the demand that we see both on-premise and also on supplies. And on the office side, we have seen the opposite effect. As many offices are still closed and people are not going back to the office, the overall office business continues to be below where it was before the pandemic. Through the end of the year, we expect the situation to reverse as offices will reopen, we expect our office business to perform better and at the same time more people will be – less people will be working from home, we expect that it will have also an impact, a negative impact on our home business. So, a similar trend to what we expected in [Puerto Rico]. In terms of demand on the Chromebook side, we continue to see very strong demand from education. We have – this is what is driving the growth of Chromebooks and this is what also when we were talking before about the ASPs on the PC side and the mix there, this is what we have in some of the impact in the pricing on the PC side, because Chromebooks overall have lower prices than the rest of the PC portfolio.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on another solid quarter. First question I have a follow-up is, when we look at the results of the commercial business starting to recover, I think you reported 10% growth. I think your peer reported growth around that tonight. So, I'm curious of how you're thinking about the back-to-work, back to office trend on the commercial PC side, any thoughts on kind of the installed base, the age of the installed base, just how you think that demand shapes up through the course of the year?
Enrique Lores: Sure. So again, similar to what we shared a quarter ago, we expect the demand on the commercial side to start to recover and we are starting to see some recovery as you are saying. What we are seeing from our clients is that they are realizing of the need to invest in better equipment for their officers when employees come back and this is really going to be helping both the Print and the PC business as you were mentioning. In terms of dynamics, we continue to see our shift from desktops into notebooks, because even if employees will be going back to their office, we still see the need for companies to offer a hybrid way of working and enabling their employees to work-from-home and therefore, we expect the shift mix from desktops into notebooks to continue. We have talked in the past, overall has a positive impact for the business because of both pricing but also because of the recycle times at PC that notebook has compared to the desktop.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, just on the free cash flow, I think you've stuck with the 4 billion free cash flow or at least 4 billion for this year. You're raising EPS. I'm just trying to maybe understand why free cash flow wouldn't be stronger and trending higher with the EPS?
Marie Myers: Yes, sure. Aaron. Let me go ahead and hit that one up for you. So look, regarding future free cash flow, as you know, this is always driven by our strong net earnings. What we're thinking is that our working capital is going to be a headwind due to some of the decisions we're making to carry more inventory. So look for 2021, we continue to remain confident obviously in our outlook and confident in our guide of at least $4 billion in free cash flow.
Enrique Lores: And I think, let me add one more comment. We are really pleased with the progress we have made in free cash flow in Q1 and Q2. The guide that we have provided is of at least $4 billion for the year and as Marie just mentioned, we are really expecting to be at that level.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Hey, thanks guys for taking the question. Congrats on the strong results. Two quick ones, if I could. Enrique, based on conversations with corporate customers and given the backlog, do you get the sense that this momentum will actually continue into calendar 2022. Would love to get any updated context there? And then I just have a quick follow-up. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Thank you for the question. And we think that the changes that we have seen driven by the pandemic are going to be permanent and are going to continue to have an impact in 2021 and 2022. More and more people will have – will be working in a hybrid way. We think that [marquees] will continue to learn from government from the time from school and this is going to continue to have a positive impact on the overall size of the PC market. And therefore, we expect the size of the market to continue to be significantly larger than what we were expecting before the pandemic. Additionally to that as we just described, we also expect to see strong commercial demand through the end of the year. So, this will also help and put even more – drive even more growth on the PC side.
Ananda Baruah: And just sticking there, just going back to the questions about mix on the PC side, you talked about strengthening Chromebook and how that, you know as having a, sort of software mix impact on ASCs. Would that not reverse as commercial, so it doesn't – continue to open up, should we not expect that to reverse and carry sort of into 2022 the mix?
Enrique Lores: So, in terms of mix, yes, we expect the mix of commercial to go up during the next quarter. And this is why Marie was mentioning before that we expect overall operating profit of Personal Systems to be slightly higher than our guided range through the end of the year.
Ananda Baruah: That's great, thanks so much.
Enrique Lores: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.
Matt Cabral: Yes, thank you. On the Print side, I was wondering if you give us an update on where you stand in trying to refill some of the supplies channel inventory? Just talk about how big of a factor that was in the quarter and how we should think about the contribution from here? And maybe more broadly just an update on your efforts to add visibility as we start thinking about getting below those Tier 1 and Tier 2 distributors that you have out there?
Marie Myers: Yes, no, sure, Matt. So, maybe I'll just start it with a quick comment on where we see the channel right now relative to supplies and I think I mentioned earlier that overall our channel inventory levels for the company are sort of below historic levels. And that includes supplies and obviously we continue to monitor that very carefully, so that we can maintain a healthy and appropriate levels. But this quarter given – if you wind it back a year ago, we had the sort of the onset of the pandemic, so we've had that channel depletion that occurred last year. And so we did see some benefit in the year-on-year compare. And from that impact of the inventory movements, we estimate that to be approximately 3% year-on-year. And as you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So, this is our best estimate based on the data we have including our channels for product across our channel and end user stock.
Matt Cabral: That's helpful. And then I think it was last week that you guys announced the new head of your 3D printing business. Maybe just a broader update on how 3D has been ramping? Where you guys stand with the push and just maybe a bigger picture on when we should start to thinking about some more explicit disclosure, just to think about the impact of that business more going forward?
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me take that one. So first of all, this quarter, we started to see or we have seen the previous one solid growth on the 3D side. Perhaps grew more than 30%, which is a very solid number. And I think these showed some of the potential that this business has in the long-term. As we had announced before, we are complementing our strategy on 3D to also focus on some end-to-end applications where we think we're going to get even more value than just by selling printers or consumables and we were mentioning on our prepared remarks, the work that we are doing a molded fiber as an example. But we really think that more and more, we will have, we will be focusing on applications to capture value in this business and this is why we selected Didier Deltort to lead this business. He comes from the health and wellness industry. So, he comes from an industry that will be disrupted by 3D and we think this will be adding significant value to the definition of our strategy. And then in terms of when we will be more transparent on the 3D business, I think as I've said before, there are two major things. One is, we want the business to have higher scale and second, and probably most important, we need to have a better defined business model. And this is where this combination of selling printers or supplies or going after end-to-end applications is so important. So, while we will have a complete perspective of where this will be going longer-term is when we will be providing more visibility.
Operator: Our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.
Jeff Rand: Hi, this is Jeff Rand on for Sidney. Can you give us an update on the competitive environment in your Personal Systems business and how this has changed through the pandemic and now a tight supply environment?
Enrique Lores: Yes, I think that first of all, as we have discussed before, really the performance of this business now is more driven by supply than by the strength of the portfolio. Now having said that, we are really pleased with the progress we have made from a portfolio perspective. If you look at the innovation that we have introduced this quarter, we won significant awards across both consumer and commercial products. We have one of the broadest portfolios in the market, covering from low-end education products to high-end commercial products and we are in a very solid position to continue to grow share as we did this quarter that shows really the relevance of our portfolio.
Jeff Rand: Great and just my follow-up, how should we think about your operating expenses trending in the near term as cost like business travel start to return?
Enrique Lores: Well, I think if you look at the projections that we have for the second half, we think we will be going back to a similar level to where we were in Q1.
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks.
Enrique Lores: Okay. So, let me close and thank you everybody for having joined us today. I think the strong results of the quarter demonstrate the relevance of HP in this hybrid world and how our technology is going to be helping customers to really perform in a very different environment. We are really pleased with the growth opportunities that we see both in our core markets, in attractive adjacencies and also in the new segments that we are creating. And we are going to continue to innovate across our technology to continue to create and drive differentiation. Thank you for your time today and looking forward to meet in person sometime soon. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q1  (2021-02-25 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the First Quarter 2021 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ailey and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. At this time, all participants will be in listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Howe: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to HP's first quarter 2021 earnings conference call.

Enrique Lores: Thank you, Beth and thank you everyone for joining the call today. I hope you and your families are safe and well. HP had an exceptional start to the year with strong revenue and profit growth in Q1. We are benefiting from the strength of our portfolio and the diversity of our businesses. We continue to evolve our business model to meet changing customer needs, while expanding into adjacencies to grow our addressable market. And we are driving an aggressive transformation agenda by rigorously managing our costs, while investing to drive future growth. Simply put, we are doing what we said we would do and our strategy is working. Our Q1 results are impressive across many dimensions. We delivered strong topline growth with net revenue up 7% to $15.6 billion and balanced growth across personal systems and print. We delivered strong bottom-line growth with $295 million in non-GAAP operating profit dollar flow through and double-digit profit growth in both personal systems and print. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings of $1.2 billion, up 24% with $0.92 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share. This is up $0.27 compared to Q1 of last year. And finally, we delivered $908 million of free cash flow in the quarter. We also remain committed to a significant return of capital. We returned $1.6 billion to shareholders including $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in dividends. Over the last three quarters, we have returned $4.4 billion to shareholders and repurchased approximately 13% of our shares. At the onset of the pandemic, I told our teams that this is a time when strong companies find ways to emerge stronger. And last quarter results show that exactly what we are doing. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets make us more resilient across business cycles. We continue to capitalize on the strong demand for our offering particularly in consumer to drive profitable growth. Yes the impact of the pandemic is ongoing and the pace of the economic recovery remains uneven. We are continuing to manage our business in a disciplined and prudent manner while remaining agile in the face of change. This means capitalizing on opportunities when they arise, while also managing volatility when it occurs. As we balance all of these dynamics, we have stayed focused on executing against our strategy to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print by optimizing our core and expanding into attractive adjacencies, disrupt industries with our technology to create new businesses in areas like 3D, industrial print and microfluidics. And transform the way we work to be more digitally enabled and cost efficient. Our continued progress against these strategic priorities is reflected in the strong revenue and profit growth, free cash flow and capital returns we delivered in Q1 and in the positive momentum in each of our businesses. I will start with Personal Systems which had another strong quarter with revenue of $10.6 billion. We shipped more than 18 million units and generated operating margins of 7.1%. Consumer revenue growth accelerated to 34% with consumer premium up 34%, gaming up 29% and consumer accessories up 22%. And on top of this, Chromebook revenue quadrupled. We exited the quarter with a record backlog as we continue to operate with component supply shortages that are expected to constrain our growth through at least Q3. It's clear we have entered a new era of innovation and growth for PCs. They have become an essential part of how people work learn and play. And we continue to innovate to create new experiences. It's funny to say, but the PC is personal once again. And we are seeing this in the awards we are receiving. At last month Consumer Electronics Show, we introduced new devices and solutions to power hybrid work environment and personal creative studios. And we were recognized with over 70 awards for our latest launches, including our new 5G-enabled products. Looking ahead we expect to see continued PC unit growth through 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth. We are also accelerating in attractive adjacencies such as gaming and peripherals. As with every market in which we play, our goal is to be a leader in this space. This week we announced the acquisition of HyperX, the market leader in gaming headsets. The addition of HyperX expands our presence in the growing peripheral market with a brand that is trusted by gamings around the world. Our existing strength in gaming hardware combined with portfolio spanning gaming headsets microphones and other peripherals will further expand our ecosystem and create another growth engine in Personal Systems. Much like Personal Systems Print is off to a terrific start to the year. This quarter demonstrated the power of print to help people learn, create and perform with 7% revenue growth, 16% unit growth and 32% profit growth. In Q1, our Printing business generated revenue of $5 billion and operating profit of $1 billion. Similar to the Personal Systems business, we remain supply constrained, particularly in consumer printer, hardware and supplies. While the COVID-19 related impacts on our manufacturing and supply chain have diminished, we anticipate these constraints to continue into the third quarter. HP is outperforming its printing peers and remain uniquely well positioned, given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong consumer business is a clear competitive advantage as hybrid work and school becomes the norm. We have seen that people who didn't have home printers went and bought them and people sign up for Instant Ink in record numbers, accelerating and already growing part of our business. In Instant Ink, we added 1 million new subscribers surprising 9 million enrollees in the first quarter. Commercial print improved in Q1 with most product categories showing sequential revenue growth. In Q4, total print market units grew 6%. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market though the price might be an even given the very ink pace of economic recovery. And we expect that the strength in consumer will gradually subside as more schools and offices reopen. We continue to execute on our strategy to modernize print and evolve our print business models. In Q1, we roll out our end-to-end platform strategy called HP Plus that combined convenient Instant Ink and HP’s Markup Services with innovative hardware. It's early days, but we are already seeing positive adoption. In the coming quarters, we will be rolling HP Plus out more broadly across multiple markets and product lines. New value propositions like HP Plus are indicative of the opportunities ahead as we continue to innovate to meet evolving customer needs. This also applies to our contractual businesses such as managed print services. Where we see attractive opportunities to deliver services, designed for the hybrid workforce of the future. One example is our HP Flex worker service. This service can be added to a company existing MPS contract to help remote workers maintain their productivity. This means being able to seamlessly print, scan and copies securely all while working from home. With leadership in both consumer and commercial and a strong track record of innovation HP is positioned to define and lead the future of printing in a post pandemic world. In city printing and industrial graphics, we continue to innovate across the portfolio to position ourselves for future growth. Customers continue to use Multi Jet fusion for production grade output and we are seeing more than 30% growth in the number of 3D printed parts across our customer base. We are also seeing strong early traction in our new molded fiber business that leverages our 3D printing technology to create an end-to-end service for quick customized and environmentally sustainable packaging. In industrial printing we continue to see growth in digital labels and packaging with double-digit growth in impressions and square meters printed. Georgia Pacific one of the world's largest packaging and paper goods providers is deploying their third Inkjet web press to expand their digital printing business. This is a great milestone and validation of our technology. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities in personalization and digital manufacturing. We are doing all this while continuing to transform the company to unlock value and become a leaner more digitally enabled company. Our transformation journey continues to be ahead of plan. We have significantly reduced structural costs and driven productivity savings. At the same time we are enabling enhanced digitization and we are shifting investments to attractive growth areas where we see opportunities for us to continue driving innovation and long-term sustainable growth. We are focused on both reducing structural costs and accelerating investments for the future. Recently, we announced several new appointments to further strengthen HP's innovation capabilities and support its long-term growth strategy. Savi Baveja joined as our Chief Strategy and Incubation Officer and Tolga Kurtoglu had joined HP as Chief Technology Officer. In this role they will drive cutting-edge research and incubate new business opportunities working together with the leadership team. And last week, we named Marie Myers as our Chief Financial Officer. Marie is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership positions at the company, including as our Controller and most recently as our Chief Transformation Officer. Marie and I have worked together for many years and she's a truly outstanding leader. I know you will all enjoy getting to know her better. Overall, I am very pleased with the way we have started the year. We built on our momentum from the end of 2020 and our teams are performing at a very high level. And on top of delivering strong results, we are also staying true to HP's values. Last quarter, HP was recognized by Newsweek as America's most responsible company for the second straight year. And we appear on the Barron's list of 100 most sustainable companies for the third straight year. In December, we were named one of the 10 best managed companies by the Wall Street Journal. This accolade simply means that we continue to ensure that making a sustainable impact remains an integrated part of our business strategy. Let me close by saying Q1 was a strong quarter that increases our confidence about the opportunities ahead. We have a diverse and resilient business model. We are leading in our core Print and Personal Systems market, while taking the steps necessary to create and scale new businesses for the future. And our strong cash flow generation provides us flexibility to return significant capital to shareholders and reinvest in businesses, while also exploring disciplined M&A. We believe this is a time when strong successful companies like HP can get stronger. We are not running our business to achieve incremental improvements. We are driving a much bolder transformation agenda that will expand our portfolio, fuel innovation and unlock attractive new sources of long-term growth and value creation. That is our ambition. With that I will turn the call over to Marie who will take you through the details of the quarter and our fiscal year outlook. Marie, over to you.
Marie Myers: It's great to be with all of you today and I wanted to thank Enrique for his trusted me as his finance partner. I'm excited to take on the CFO role after more than two decades at HP. I'm looking forward to getting to know the investment community as I settle into my new role. It's clear that HP remains focused on executing each quarter, while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near-term, while investing in growth and leading through this dynamic environment. Q1 was a very strong quarter, we grew revenue non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start for the year. And overall, we are very pleased with our results. Now let's look at the details of the first quarter. Q1 net revenue was $15.6 billion up 7% both nominally and in constant currency. Regionally in constant currency, Americas increased 17%, EMEA increased 3% and APJ decreased 5%. Gross margin was 21.2% and up 1.6 points year-on-year. The increase was driven by favorable pricing and commodity costs in Personal Systems and favorable pricing in printing, particularly, in consumer hardware. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up $157 million. The increase in operating expenses was driven by investments to position for future growth and an increase in certain one-time expenses. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $63 million for the quarter, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 42% to $0.92 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.3 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $120 million, primarily related to restructuring and other charges, amortization of intangible assets, other tax adjustments and partially offset by non-operating retirement related credits. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.83. Turning to segment performance. In Q1, peripheral systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.6 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Our top-line remained constrained due to industry-wide component shortages. Drilling into the details, we continue to see differing results by customer segment with consumer revenue up 34% while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, revenue was up 23% for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 36% for workstations. Strong demand for notebooks drove total unit growth of 15% year-over-year with Chromebooks representing 16% of our total personal systems units as the need for technology and education continued to grow. Personal systems delivered a record $758 million in operating profit and operating margins of 7.1% much higher than our outlook. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing, including fewer promotions and favorable commodity cost. In print, our results reflected very strong execution as we continue to benefit from the strength of our portfolio as a leader across both consumer and commercial print. Q1 total print revenue was $5 billion, up 7%. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 55% with units up 18% and commercial revenue was down 11% and flat in units. In total, hardware units were very strong at 11.1 million units, up 16%. Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, up 3%. In the first quarter, ongoing consumer demand combined with favorable pricing and inventory replenishment more than offset lower commercial demand. Sequentially, supplies revenue was flat. Print operating profit was very strong at $1 billion and operating margins were 19.8%. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to favorable pricing including fewer promotions. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings opportunities. In Q1 about 700 people exited the company as we continue to be ahead of plan against our three-year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During the quarter, we continued to execute real estate site optimization activities at six sites that are aligned with our location and mobility strategies. In addition, we have achieved additional efficiency improvements in customer service and support as we continue to shift to digitization and automation. Finally, we continue to be focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure as it provides us the flexibility to reinvest in other areas of our business. Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. First quarter cash flow for operations and free cash flow were solid at $1 billion and $908 million, respectively. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially the cash conversion cycle was flat as growth in inventory primarily driven by strategic buys and finished goods drove increases in days of inventory offset by increases in days payable outstanding. Days sales outstanding also decreased during the quarter. For the quarter we returned a total of $1.6 billion to shareholders which represented 179% of free cash flow. This included $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $250 million in cash dividends. Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters unless higher return opportunities emerge. Looking forward to the second quarter and the rest of fiscal 2021, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. While we expect year-over-year revenue growth in FY 2021 to reflect our continued progress on our strategy, it is also important to note that growth trends in Q2 and Q3 will also reflect the easier year-over-year comparisons due to the unusual COVID related impacts we saw last year. And in the second half of the year, we expect to see a more normalization of the market environment, as more people return to the office and kids returned to, school and as the pricing environment normalizes. Our outlook range is broader than usual given the current market environment. We are modeling multiple scenarios related to supply availability, pricing dynamics and the pace of economic re-opening. Our comments for Q2 are the following. In Personal Systems our backlog remains elevated as demand in consumer and education remains very strong. And we expect industry-wide component constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks which will constrain top line growth. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be slightly higher compared to Q1 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q2 operating margins to be in the range of Q1 margins. In Printing, from a demand perspective we expect to continue to see strong demand for home printing as well as the continued economic pressure in commercial printing. We expect to have to navigate supply constraints and the need to replenish stock so that our ecosystem of partners, are well positioned to satisfy the strong demand that we see in printers and supplies. We expect that our operating margin for Q2 to be at the high end of our long-term range of 16% to 18%. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q2 and FY 2021. We expect second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.90. And second quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.88. We expect FY 2021 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25. And FY 2021 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.98 to $3.08. For FY 2021, we expect our free cash flow to be at least $4 billion. And now, I would like to hand it back to the operator. And open the call for your questions.
Question-and:
Operator: Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. And Marie, I just wanted to congratulate you on the new role. My question I'm going to -- it's a two-part question, so I'll just leave it to one question today. I was wondering, Enrique, can you talk a bit about sustainability and sort of beyond the quarter that you've guided to? And that's one of the big questions I think people have right now. Maybe if you can -- you put it to shortages in PCs lasting until third quarter. So maybe you can talk on the PC side a little bit about what you see long-term for the market? And what might support the PC business sort of in future quarters. And then, if you could turn to printing, if you can talk a bit about what Print Plus means for the long-term model? And how you see that impacting margins as well as discussing a bit, because I think maybe it's underappreciated how the shift to Inkjet is going to help margins long-term since you own the whole Inkjet stack and have to partner with Canon for laser. So if you could maybe address those two parts, that is my -- completes my question. Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Okay. Thank you Shannon and I will try to answer all your points. So let me start with sustainability of the momentum that we see. And I would say that, we are very optimistic about what we -- what are our expectations for the market for the coming quarters. We think that many of the underlying trends that are driving demand today are going to stay. I think the pandemic has made technology clear necessary for people to work to entertain to live. And this is going to continue to drive very strong demand for PCs and for home printers for the foreseeable future, but especially for PC. We also think that as offices will reopen. We are going to see an increase of demand on the PC space because will have to invest on PCs again to make their employees productive. And we are going to continue to see a shift towards notebooks that also helps on the demand side as the renewal cycles are shorter. We also think that the need to -- the hybrid model of working between office and home opens new opportunities for us on the printing side to offer new services create new services by combining both. So overall again, we see that this is creating an opportunity for us not only to leverage new opportunities, but really to continue to drive change and to continue to gain momentum. If I go now to the second part of your question on PCs, we expect to continue to see very strong demand for PCs in the coming quarters. And this strong demand is what is creating the supplies the component shortages that you were mentioning. We have provided strong guidance today both for the quarter and for the year. And this is based of course on the visibility that we have today for components what we think we are going to be able to hit, if we get more components we could do even better. And then your final question on Print. As you know we launched HP Plus during last quarter the reception has been very positive in terms of both adoption of the end-to-end model and also feedback from customers in terms of the value proposition and feedback from partners. So going I would say, we are optimistic about the results we have seen. And as you know we are going to expand into more countries and more categories during the coming months until we complete the rollout in the middle of 2022. You were also asking about the impact on margins. Let me start there and maybe Marie will complement that. Clearly we see a benefit from the mix moving into India later because as you know we end the full end-to-end system. But this quarter we are also seeing a strong benefit from pricing. Especially on hardware that is really helping to increase the profitability on print.
Marie Myers: And yes. Thank you for your Shannon. Yes look we expect our print margins to remain strong throughout FY 2021 and we expect our operating dollars to grow an operating profit rate to be at the higher end of the 16% to 18% range for 2021. And in Q2 we'd expect to be above the range as well.
Operator: And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Katy Huberty: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask a clarification first. You said in your prepared remarks that you see PCs growing through 2021, does that mean that you will see growth in each of the four quarters? Obviously you grew strong in 1Q? Or is that just implying that you will grow for the full year? And then in terms of my question just following up on the print business can you talk about how much channel inventory rebuild contributed to print revenue in the quarter. And Marie you made it clear that you expect Print margins at the upper end of the range, but why would they come down sequentially given that the pricing environment remains quite favorable?
Enrique Lores: Okay. Thank you, Katie. Let me start with a clarification. When I was talking about PC growth to continue, I was referring to market. As I was saying in answer to Shannon, we expect the market to continue to be very strong both this year and in the long term. And then let me offer a data point. If we look at the projection that we have for PC market in 2021, the one we have now and we compare it to the projection that we have for 2021 before the pandemic started the market is 45% bigger. So this talks about the growth that we have seen in PCs and really the -- why we are so optimistic about this business going forward. And now Marie will talk about the margins for print in Q1.
Marie Myers : Actually I was going to move on and just cover your question around channel inventory Katy. So look with respect to that overall channel inventory is below what we believe are healthy appropriate levels for print. And that's really as a result of that strength that we're seeing in consumer. And right now we're also below the range and that's driven by that demand in home. We do expect however some replenishment of stock throughout our partner ecosystem into Q3 and that's going to help to bridge some of that demand from our customers. So overall, we want to make sure that our partner ecosystem is very well positioned to satisfy that demand.
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have two questions as well. First, if I look at your guidance for the full year, it implies an EPS decline at the midpoint down more than 20% in the second half versus the first half. Typically seasonality would point to EPS being up 10% in the second half. So I was wondering if you can comment on that. Are you being conservative? Because it sounds like you're going to be supply-constrained through potentially Q3, or are you believing that this very favorable price environment is going to come off. So are you expecting this deceleration because of conservatism? Are you expecting it because of weaker than normal sequential revenue growth? Or are you expecting it because you expect margins to go down to lower levels in the second half? And then I have a follow-up please.
Marie Myers: Right. Hey, Toni, good afternoon. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, look, frankly Toni we've provided actually a very strong guide for the year. And we're investing for our future. In fact, we expect revenue growth in FY 2021 and EPS to be up 38% to 43% and free cash flow growth as well. So, while to your point this is front-end loaded in the first half, the second half EPS growth is actually 23% to 32% of the 111 that we actually delivered last year. And this actually includes earnings growth as well as the benefit of lower shares. So given the current environment as you could imagine we are modeling multiple scenarios for the second half. So look all-in-all, we believe that this is a prudent guide based on what we know today. And clearly, if we can do better we absolutely will.
Toni Sacconaghi:  Okay. I guess, I was trying to get a better sense of whether there was more confidence in the revenue trajectory or the margin trajectory. But just in terms of the follow-up, I want to better understand this restocking whether this is hardware or supplies are both on the print side is it principally consumer. So I presume your stock is going down on the corporate side since demand is much weaker and your channel inventory in dollars is going up on the consumer side and that's obviously very, very favorable. But you talked about this being a benefit last quarter this being a benefit this quarter that's potentially being a benefit next quarter. I'd like to understand exactly what that benefit is. And then maybe you could kind of zoom out a bit and just talk about how we should think about normalized supplies growth. I think over the last eight or nine years, it's gone down about 4% per year. The aspiration was to get to flat supplies growth. I think it took you a little longer to get there. You haven't really provided an update on how you think about supplies growth sort of in a more normalized environment how should we think about that? Thank you.
Enrique Lores : Great. Thank you Toni. Let me start and let me emphasize that we are very confident on both the revenue and profit projections for the year and this is what supports the strong guide that we have provided today. In terms of channel inventory the comments from that we made in the prepared remarks are not only for supply, but also for hardware, and we continue to be across the board in PCs, printers and supplies below what we think are the ideal inventory levels that we have for the channel. So that's -- this is where we are today. And all this is driven by the very strong demand that we continue to see especially, on our home products. And now let Marie explain what do we see on supplies? And what do we think is an impact on the replenishment this quarter?
Marie Myers:  And thanks Enrique. So Tony, looking at supplies performance there's sort of really three key dynamics to discuss. First of all, ongoing demand in consumer supplies with work-from-home and learn-from-home and there are ongoing challenges in commercial print as you know. And then secondly there's that favorable pricing environment, which was actually a tailwind. And then thirdly, the year-over-year compares also benefited from that replenishment of stock which was consistent with what we had indicated on the call in Q4. Now if you adjust for the impact of inventory movements, we estimate that supplies revenue was down roughly a 1% year-on-year. As you know, we have a multi-tiered channel. So this is our best estimate based on the data we have including our estimates for product across the channel and end-user stock. So this replenishment should have a short-term benefit to supplies revenue.
Enrique Lores:  I'm commenting on the projections for the future, Tony. As you know, we are -- we have redesigned the strategy of the company to reduce the dependency on supplies to deliver our goals. This is why the subscription programs HP Plus are so critical. And we are very pleased with the progress that we're making on that front. We shared in the prepared remarks that we reached nine million subscribers on Inc. which means we added one million subscribers this quarter which is the factor and the most we have done in the history of the program. So clearly that is accelerating. And at the same -- as I also shared before, we are really pleased with the response that we have got on HP Plus and we are also making good progress on what we call big ink and big toner for in emerging countries which are a key part of our strategy as well.
Operator:  Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.
Amit Daryanani:  Perfect. Thank you. It looks like I really have no printing questions for you guys anymore. But I do want to talk about free cash flow. And if I look at the fiscal 2021 guide I think you talked about $4 billion of free cash flow. It's really a modest uplift from the $3.9 billion we did in fiscal '20. So really just help me understand with revenue up the way it is and I think EPS is going to be up 35%, 40%, why is free cash flow up $100 million and change? Just what are the puts and takes that would be really helpful?
Marie Myers : Yes. Good afternoon, Amit. So first of all, look at start-up and saying look, we're really pleased with the results of free cash flow and what we saw in the quarter. Now as we look forward to FY 2021 a bit, we expect free cash flow as I said in my prepared remarks to be at least $4 billion and in that is being driven by the earnings growth in both PS and print. And it is being sort of the headwind that we do have is it will be partially offset by changes in working capital, which we expect to -- from higher expected inventory and AR. And that's being driven obviously by the environment that we're in with PS.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then I guess, Marie, really from your perspective as you step into the CFO role and your background as the Chief Transformation Officer. I'd love to get a sense on as you go forward how do you go between managing the need to reduce costs and optimize margins versus perhaps investing for growth as you go forward? And as you think about HP over the next two, three years, what are the big priorities for the company for investments?
Marie Myers :  No. Thanks, Amit. Look, frankly, I believe that great companies like HP focus on the end. We have to do both. We have to reduce costs and we have to make the right investments for the future. So I can tell you as the CFO, I'm going to be relentless about going after inefficiency and making sure we're driving value from our investments. I think my role is the Chief Transformation Officer really teed me up nicely for that outlook. Now with respect to investments, I'm going to turn it over to Enrique to add some color there.
Enrique Lores : And before I do that let me emphasize the comment from Marie about the end. We need to continue and we will continue reducing cost and we will continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for the future. And my answer is not going to surprise anybody because this is the strategy we have been executing during the last years. It's about modernizing our core businesses both personal systems and print. We see opportunities to create value on both, it is about expanding into adjacencies. And yesterday, we shared the acquisition of HyperX that is an example of a very attractive adjacency for us, and we are also investing to create new businesses in industrial graphics in 3D printing, in microfluidics. And we see also the need to invest in improving our digital infrastructure that will help us to create new business model, but as Marie was saying, also to become more efficient leaner and really being able to respond to our customers in a better way. This is the strategy, we have been executing. The results show that it is growing and this is where we are going to be investing going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse.
Matt Cabral: Yeah. Thank you. Enrique, you just mentioned Hyperx. I wanted to dig a little bit more into that. I guess, first just a clarification. I saw in the release you guys said, it's EPS accretive, but wondering if you guys can comment on the revenue contribution you expect from Hyperx going forward? And then more broadly, just wondering for your perspective on PC gaming and just how we should think about sustainability there once people start leaving their homes in a more normalized manner? And just how you think about Hypera's peripheral spitting versus your OMEN brand within the lineup?
Enrique Lores: So first of all, let me start on gaming. Gaming is a very attractive opportunity for us both on the hardware side, where we have been growing significantly during the last quarter and where we expect to continue to see growth in the coming years. More and more people are using gaming at their main entertainment and this is driving growth today and will continue to drive growth in the future. When we look about gaming the peripheral opportunity is especially attractive. A gamer spends about 15, 16 more money on accessories than a normal PC user. And when we think about that opportunity the acquisition of Hyperx makes us really excited about the opportunity of really capturing that. Hyperx is the leader in gaming headsets they have a very strong portfolio on microphones mic keyboard. And really the growth – the value proposition of the acquisition is very clear. We are going to accelerate that growth by leveraging our geographical presence and our broader retail presence, as well as we will be taking their portfolio and expanding into new segments like commercial. Soil is all about growth and this is – and this growth is what makes it accretive for us in 2022.
Matt Cabral: Thanks for that. And as my follow-up, I wanted to broaden out the discussion on M&A and just talk about how you think about M&A strategically, and I heard in the prepared remarks that the plan is still outsized buybacks and less a better opportunity comes along. So maybe just help us understand the criteria you think about that trade-off between repurchases and other uses of capital going forward?
Enrique Lores: Our approach has not changed from what we have been communicating during the last quarter. We continue to believe that our stock is undervalued and we are going to continue to buy aggressively our shares. Marie mentioned that, we are going to be buying at least $1 billion of shares every quarter. And at the same time, we are always looking for opportunities to accelerate our strategies through M&A. We are looking at opportunities in the core businesses in adjacencies, and also to support our new businesses. And the criteria are very simple. Any M&A, we will do – will have to be aligned to the strategies we have explained. I will have to have attractive financial returns at a minimum a better ROI than buying our own stock. And third, we need to have a strong operational plan to execute on the value proposition of the acquisition. These are the criteria we have been applying. This is what we used to decide to acquire Hyperx and this is how we think about M&A.
Operator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company.
Krish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the solid results. And Marie congrats on the full-time CFO title. I have two quick questions. First, Enrique or Marie, is there a way to quantify what would be the upside to revenues if you had no supply constraints? And then I had a quick follow-up.
Enrique Lores: Let me take the question. What you have in the guide is what we think we – based on the current supply that we see available, we can deliver, of course, if there was more supply, we will be able to drive more, but I don't think we will quantify what this number is. But let me tell you is, as I said in the prepared remarks, our backlog is at a record high. So it will be a significant number. But again, we are seeing shortages given how strong the demand is across the board.
Krish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Enrique for that. And then as a quick follow-up. The gross margins in the January quarter were really strong. What were the drivers there? And how to think about gross margin for the rest of the year, especially as component costs get inflationary for you folks?
Marie Myers: Yeah. Shankar thanks for the kind words. So look fundamentally, it's just all about demand frankly outpacing supply and really creating that favorable environment. So it's basically just the laws of supply and demand which helped us with better pricing in the quarter. So regardless of whether you're sort of talking year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter that improvement in gross margin was primarily driven by favorable pricing which showed up as fewer promotions and as cost improvements.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you can go back to print margins for a second and look at this on a quarter-on-quarter basis. When we look at the sequential revenue improvement that was about $200 million in Print the Print profitability went up by $300 million. So maybe you can help us think through how much of that was pricing on hardware where there is fixed cost leverage that you might be recognizing versus higher mix on HP Inc. versus laser tower. If there's a way to dissect this somewhat differently in the $300 million and purely replenishment has a role there too, any way to maybe size those different components? And also if we can split between hardware and supplies I think that would give us a better sense of how the trajectory of this good progress? Thank you.
Marie Myers: Sure, no thanks for your question. And so look the Print rate really benefited from improved gross margins, particularly in home hardware and that was driven by that favorable pricing that I mentioned earlier. And it was particularly in the consumer side. And some of those -- and then we had reductions from COVID-related supply chain costs that we had in Q4 and then that was partially offset by higher consumer mix and lower supplies mix. So that and all is what contributed to the rate. And overall we're seeing the strength and resiliency of our broad Print portfolio and leadership across customer segments and that's really positioned us very well against our competition.
Wamsi Mohan: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS.
David Vogt: Great. Thank you. Maybe just going back to the component shortage issue for a second. It's been persistent for some time now and there's been commentary across different industries that lead times are lengthening across the board. I know inventory is up this quarter 49 days 43 last quarter. But can you give us more qualitative discussion on how you're thinking about remediation going forward in your future procurement plans. In case there's a greater disruption and what that might mean for your top line going forward? Thanks.
Enrique Lores: Sure. So as I said before, the shortages that we are seeing are really driven by the very strong demand that we are getting across the full portfolio. We of course are taking any action we can to mitigate the impact and make sure that we can deliver even more than what we have in the plan. One of the big things that we have decided as Marie mentioned before is to increase the amount of inventory that we have on hand. This will help us not only to increase the delivery of the shipment of products, but also to be able to ship more products in case some components are made available during the quarter.  We are also building direct connection with suppliers that until now will be managed from our ODMs usually suppliers of low-cost components because we have seen that it's important to really establish a direct connection with them and in some cases even buy products directly from them. And this I would say are the two big things that we have already done and that we expect will help us to manage the situation during the coming quarters.
David Vogt: And maybe just a quick follow-up on that. So when you think about sort of the inventory that you're taking in and that you're going to procure going forward, is there any sort of commentary or guidance you can give us in terms of what the margin impact might look like from that inventory today going forward as you burn through that inventory maybe later this year into next fiscal year?
Enrique Lores: I think given how strong our demand is if you are concerned about obsolescence of some of the inventory, I think the risk is extremely low because we really have very strong demand and we expect it to continue during the coming quarters. In terms of cost of components, we are expecting that in some cases cost will be increasing during the coming quarters but all of this is built into our guidance, and built into the comments that Marie made before in terms of operating margin during the coming quarters.
Marie Myers: And just a follow-up on Enrique's comment. As a result then we would expect from an overall basket of commodity pricing perspective for those prices to be higher than what we've seen in Q1 going forward as well.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much and congratulations on the very strong results and outlook. When we dive – I have one question. When we dive into the results on PCs, yes you are growing, but it seems like some of your competitors, especially your North America competitors growing much stronger than you. You did highlight that you grew a lot in Chromebook. So I'm wondering is the strategy there to really focus on education and Chromebooks or profit share gains or market share maintaining, even if you lose some share? I just wanted to revisit your strategy in the PC side, when we look at the data versus the industry?
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me be very clear Jim. So we had a very strong quarter in absolute terms on PCs, revenue growth, unit growth, profit growth but we didn't on relative terms. And being as competitive as we are, this is not something that we are satisfied about. As I explained before, we are looking at what can we do and what will we do to improve our relative performance. We have already taken some actions to do that by increasing inventory and changing how the connections that we have with certain component providers and this will be helping us to improve our performance going forward. We are really using this as a catalyst to optimize even further our operational capabilities and this is what great company do and what we will continue to do, because again, we like to win and this is what we will continue to do going forward.
Enrique Lores: So having said that, I think we are close to time. So let me use this as an opportunity to wrap up. First of all I want to repeat some of the comments I made during the prepared remarks. We are doing what we said we would do. And our strategy is working. We have had a very strong start of the year and we are confident in the projections that we have for 2021 and beyond. We see growth opportunities in our core markets in the adjacencies and also in the new businesses that we are creating. And we are really leveraging the opportunities that we see to accelerate our strategy, accelerate our growth, which gives us great confidence in the future of the company. So again, thank you for joining us today and looking forward to continue to talk to all of you in the future. Thank you.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q4  (2020-11-24 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the HP Inc. Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. 
 I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to HP's Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Marie Myers, HP's Acting Chief Financial Officer.  
 Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of this webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com.  As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials related to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
 We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2020 and HP's other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. 
 And now I'll turn it over to Enrique. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Beth. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. It remains a difficult time for so many across the world. I hope you and your families are safe and healthy. 
 Today, I will recap our strong Q4 and full year financial results, and I will discuss the significant progress against our Advance, Disrupt and Transform strategy. Let me start with the strength of Q4, where we drove improvement relative to the third quarter in revenue, operating profit, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow. We are encouraged by the signs of improvement in our business as we continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment.  
 For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $15.3 billion, flat year-over-year in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.62, up 3% year-on-year. And we generated free cash flow of $1.8 billion.
 For fiscal '20, despite the pandemic, we delivered on the full-year non-GAAP EPS and cash flow outlook we gave at our Analyst Day last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered revenue of $56.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.28. In addition, we generated strong free cash flow of $3.9 billion, and we returned $4.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making appropriate investments in the business.
 Looking at our performance, 2 themes stand out that are consistent across both print and personal systems. HP's broad and differentiated portfolio and leadership across consumer and commercial markets makes our company more resilient across business cycles. And secondly, our operational execution, including our disciplined pricing, strategic cost reductions and supply chain agility, help us navigate in a very dynamic environment. Underpinning it all is a purpose-driven culture built on strong corporate values. Our founders used to say that the greatest competitive advantage is doing the right thing at the worst time. And our teams have lived up to this ideal through a tremendously difficult year, consistently stepping up to do the right things for our business, our customers and our communities around the world.  This is who we are as a company, and I could not be more proud.
 Now let me turn to our business and review the progress we have made against our strategy. 
 We are advancing our leadership in our core market and expanding our reach into profitable adjacencies. We are positioning ourselves to disrupt new markets where our technologies and IP present significant opportunities to create and scale new businesses over time. And we are transforming the way we operate across the company with a focus on building out our cloud infrastructure and our digital capabilities, while reducing our cost structure. Our progress can be seen in each of our business units. It was another strong quarter for Personal Systems with revenue of $10.4 billion and a record 19 million units shipped.
 We grew consumer revenue 24%, with consumer premium up 29%, and consumer displays and accessory up 59%. Chromebook revenue and units more than doubled.  
 We exited the quarter with an elevated backlog and continued to operate with component supply shortages, which are expected to constrain our growth through the first half of 2021.
 The PC is more essential to daily life than ever before, and demand for our innovation remains strong. 
 We launched a range of new products in our core compute categories last quarter. To meet the needs of professional creators and others that require uncompromising mobile computing performance, we unveiled our new ZBook Fury mobile workstations. We also announced a new lineup of HP ProBook and HP Spectre 360, and we expanded our Chromebook and Mobile Thin Client portfolios. 
 And as PC gaming continues to surge in popularity, we debuted a range of new OMEN accessories, including the OMEN frequency wireless headset, OMEN Vector Wireless Mouse and OMEN Spacer Wireless Keyboard.  This momentum in gaming accessories reflects our broader focus on innovating in important adjacencies, including peripherals and services. 
 During the second half of this year, we introduced a number of new monitors to improve the work-from-home experience, including always-on, low blue light to reduce eye strain and displays with increased touch capability.  And we expanded our service offerings including a new device-as-a-service bundle, specifically designed to simplify life for small and medium businesses. 
 We expect to see continued PC unit growth in 2021, which we anticipate will create additional opportunities for us to drive profitable growth as well as grow the lifetime value of our installed base by broadening our ecosystem of peripherals and services.
 Turning to print. I am very pleased with the sequential growth in revenue, profit, supply and unit shipments. In Q4, the printing business generated revenue of $4.8 billion and operating profit of $713 million. We delivered a strong quarter relative to the market conditions. 
 COVID-related effects on both supply and demand have continued to impact our printing results. From a demand perspective, ongoing demand for consumer hardware and supplies, combined with disciplined pricing, substantially offset the declines in commercial print. And from a supply perspective, while we began to replenish stock at our partners, we anticipate continued supply constraints on some consumer hardware and supplies SKUs. 
 HP is outperforming its peers and remains uniquely well positioned, given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print. Our strong consumer business is a clear advantage for us as the shift to remote work and school continues to create momentum in home printing.  
 We also saw some progress in commercial print, driven by the SMB sector. We expect a gradual recovery in the overall commercial print market. The recovery may be uneven given the varying pace of economic recovery and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some countries. And we expect that the strength in home will gradually subside when more offices and schools reopen. 
 We continue to evolve our print business models with a drive toward services and a rebalance of profitability between hardware and supply.  Our Instant Ink subscription business continued to see rapid growth, with subscribers up double digits, surpassing our target of 8 million enrollees. We are making progress on rebalancing the business model between hardware and supplies. We are expanding profit upfront with 69% unit growth on [ Cs or big ink ]. We have improved consumer hardware ARU year-over-year through selective price increases, new product innovations and lower discounts. And earlier this month, we began the rollout of our much anticipated end-to-end platform strategy that we discussed at SAM last year. HP Plus, our end-to-end system, provides a differentiated value proposition for our loyal customers. We plan to extend HP Plus across most of our home and small office portfolio in developed markets as we roll out new products. Together, we expect these actions will help us to optimize the business by reducing the number of unprofitable customers.
 We are also making progress against our plans to disrupt industries with our technology solutions and IP to drive medium- to long-term value creation. 
 While the industrial businesses of graphics and 3D continue to be impacted by lower business activity due to the pandemic, we saw sequential improvement in both businesses as well as growth in strategic markets. In labels and packaging, for example, we had significant new system wins at ePac for flexible packaging and box maker for corrugated boxes, and [ impressions ] and square meters increased double digits year-over-year.  
 In 3D, we continue to shift our focus toward more end-to-end solutions and higher value applications. For example, this quarter, we launched a new tooling solution to disrupt the molded fiber packaging sector. Molded fiber packaging covers thousands of products ranging from food and beverage containers to packaging for household goods and consumer electronics. We are excited for the disruptive potential in this sector as our innovative technology opens up entirely new possibilities. 
 We are doing all of these while transforming the way we work to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. We have delivered on the foundational milestones that we outlined previously, and we are well ahead of our cost savings target this year. We have significantly reduced structural costs, driven productivity savings and enable enhanced digitization. Marie will go into more detail in a few minutes. 
 And we are still in the early days of our transformation.  The progress we made in fiscal year '20 is indicative of the opportunities we see in fiscal '21 and beyond. These will remain a big area of focus as we continue to drive digital transformation and efficiency across the organization to position the business for growth.  
 Let me sum up by reiterating the strength of our position as we enter fiscal 2021. A powerful blend of innovation and execution is driving our business forward. We have a diverse and resilient business model, are leading in our core market, investing appropriately in attractive growth opportunities and taking the steps necessary to transform for the future. We remain committed to generating strong cash flow and to value-creating capital allocation. This includes our robust share repurchase and dividend program and disciplined organic and inorganic investments.
 We will continue to lead with our values of making a sustainable impact in the world, including stepped up efforts to support diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as to reduce our environmental footprint and mitigate the growing threats of climate change. These are business imperatives, where we have a deep and unwavering commitment.  
 Before turning the call over to Marie, let me share some details on her background. Marie is both our Chief Transformation Officer and our acting CFO. She is a veteran of HP, having held a number of leadership position at the company, including as our controller. Prior to returning to HP earlier this year, she was CFO at UiPath. And as Chief Transformation Officer, her leadership has been integral to the cost savings we have delivered over the past year. I'm really grateful to have her leading finance through this transition.
 I'll now pass it to Marie to review the financials. 
Marie Myers: Thank you, Enrique, for the kind introduction. It's great to be with all of you today. 
 Q4 was a strong finish against a tough 2020 backdrop. With that said, our performance reflected the company's multiple profit levers, solid execution and resiliency. Before diving further into Q4, let me quickly recap FY '20 for the full year. 
 We delivered revenue of $56.6 billion, down 2% in constant currency. We grew non-GAAP EPS 2%, which continues our trend of growing non-GAAP EPS every year since separation. 
 We generated $3.9 billion of free cash flow, above our full year guidance. And we returned $4.1 billion, or 105% of free cash flow, to shareholders. Importantly, we've delivered these results while investing in our business for future growth and efficiency during the global pandemic. 
 Our foundation is strong, including our balance sheet, and we have multiple levers to create value for our shareholders. 
 Now let's look at the details of the fourth quarter. Q4 net revenue was $15.3 billion, down 1% year-on-year, or flat in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas increased 4%, EMEA decreased 1% and APJ decreased 6%. Gross margin was 17.6%, down 1.4 points year-on-year. The decline was due to a combination of a higher consumer mix within both Personal Systems and print hardware and lower rate in commercial print. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, down $169 million. The decline in operating expenses was driven by our ongoing cost efficiency program as part of our transformation efforts as well as a reduction in discretionary costs. 
 Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $0.62, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares.  Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net expense totaling $167 million related to onetime defined benefit plan settlement charges, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other charges and partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.49. 
 Turning to segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems benefited from solid demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.4 billion, flat as reported, or up 1% in constant currency. Our top line remained constrained due to industry-wide supply shortages in CPUs and panels. Drilling into the details, we saw differing results by customer segment, with consumer revenue up 24%, while commercial revenue was down 12%. By product category, revenue was up 18% for notebooks, down 28% for desktops and down 45% for workstations. The change in mix reflected the strong demand for notebooks, mainly in Chromebooks, which represented 20% of our total Personal Systems units as working and learning from home continued. 
 Personal Systems delivered $528 million in operating profit and operating margins of 5.1%, in line with our outlook and at the high end of our long-term range of 3.5% to 5.5%. Our results reflected the impact of a higher consumer segment mix within our portfolio and lower commercial rate, which were partially offset by cost reductions. 
 In print, our results reflected strong execution and the team's agility as we continue to see a trade-off in demand between home and office print due to the pandemic. Within commercial office print, we did see some improvement driven by SMB. Importantly, HP remains uniquely well positioned in the print market by being a leader across both home and office with portfolio depth and resiliency to navigate these uncertain times. 
 Q4 total print revenue was $4.8 billion, down 3% nominally and 2% in constant currency. By customer segment, consumer hardware revenue was up 21%, with units up 18% and commercial hardware revenue was down 22% on a 10% reduction in units. In total, hardware units were up 14% to 11.8 million units, a record since we became a separate company. 
 Supplies revenue was $3.1 billion, flat in constant currency. In the fourth quarter, lower commercial printing was offset by consumer demand due to work- and learn-from-home, and disciplined pricing as well as replenishment of stock at our channel partners as product availability improved. Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the ceiling. 
 Print operating profit was $713 million, and operating margins were 14.8%. The year-over-year decline was due to lower commercial print hardware rate and strong consumer hardware shipments, partially offset by strong supplies performance and OpEx reductions. 
 Now let me turn to our cost savings and transformation efforts. We finished FY '20 ahead of the first year cost reduction target, which is 40% of our 3-year $1.2 billion gross run rate structural cost reduction plan. During this dynamic environment, we are also reducing discretionary costs as much as possible, even though they are more temporary in nature. To illustrate, we've seen significant operating expense reductions throughout the year, with Q4 non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue at 10.7%. 
 We are focused on continuing to dive deeper into our transformational efforts. As an example, in FY '20, we have taken site optimization actions by exiting over 30 real estate sites to align with our location and mobility strategy. In addition, we have seen efficiency improvement in our customer service and support, driven by our continued shift to digital, which resulted in an over 300% year-over-year increase in virtual agent interactions in the second half of 2020. 
 Finally, we continue to make progress in our new partner program, Amplify, which we announced last quarter to enable enhanced data analytics and provide partners with the capabilities, tools and insights required to capitalize on opportunities across the portfolio. 
 As we head into FY '21, we are focused on further digital enablement and driving a lean cost structure because we believe it enables top and bottom line growth. 
 Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were strong at $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The stronger-than-expected cash flow was driven by higher earnings and contributions from working capital. For Q1, we expect free cash flow to be softer than Q4, in line with typical seasonal patterns. In Q4, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle was flat as normalized purchasing and sales drove decreases in days of inventory and days sales outstanding, offset by decreases in days payable outstanding. 
 We returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and $238 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the year, we have returned a total of $4.1 billion, which represented 105% of free cash flow and a year-over-year increase of 22%. 
 Today, we announced that we are increasing our dividend by 10%. 
 Looking forward, we expect to continue buying back shares at elevated levels of at least $1 billion per quarter in the coming quarters. 
 Heading into Q1, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect macroeconomic conditions to be more uncertain as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. 
 Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions. Our backlog remains elevated and higher than the previous quarter, but we expect industry-wide CPU, panel and semiconductor constraints to continue to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. We expect continued strong demand in consumer and education pressure in commercial, particularly desktops and workstations. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be similar to Q4 levels. And from a margin perspective, we expect Q1 operating margins to be similar to Q4. 
 In printing, from a demand perspective due to the pandemic, we expect to continue to see the positive demand for home printing, offset by more competitive pricing in home printing as well as continued economic pressure on commercial printing. We expect to continue to navigate the supply constraints with a focus on appropriately replenishing stock so that our partners are well positioned to satisfy demand. We expect our operating margin for Q1 to get into the long-term range of 16% to 18%. 
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following guidance for Q1. We expect first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.70. And first quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.64. 
 And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Congrats on the quarter. The recovery in printing revenue was particularly impressive, especially with supplies revenue getting back to flat year-over-year in constant currency. But the operating margin was below your long-term range, and you're talking about getting back to that 16% to 18% operating range in the first quarter. So just curious what held operating margins back in the fourth quarter? And what are the factors allowing you to expand margins sequentially going into the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up -- or the first quarter? And then I have a follow-up. 
Marie Myers: So thank you, Katy. So let me provide you with some color around the print OP rate in Q4. So first of all, I'd start out by saying we had strong consumer hardware unit placements, which as you know, have negative margins upfront, coupled with the softness in commercial parts of our business, such as graphics and 3D, combined with lower volumes and higher costs. We're absorbing those costs across the portfolio. Plus, there has been some volatility that we experienced in our supply chain which resulted in some additional costs in the quarter and also in areas such as logistics, where we had a mix -- a higher mix of air shipments. So the print OP rate was also partially offset by supplies volume and pricing discipline. And in summary, that's what drove that decline in the rate in the quarter. As we look forward to Q1, there are some headwinds and tailwinds on cost. And we do expect that there will be some higher logistics costs, particularly in using sort of a stronger mix of air, but we do have some onetime-related COVID supply chain costs that we expect will be lower going into Q1. 
Kathryn Huberty: Okay, great. And then I appreciate you don't guide to revenue, but if we think about the PC and print revenue trends heading into the fiscal first quarter, what do you think those will look like relative to historical first quarter seasonality? 
Enrique Lores: Katy, thank you for the question. We expect most of the trends that we saw in Q4 to continue during Q1. If you look at the comments we made during the prepared remarks, we have seen very strong demand on the consumer side of both print and Personal Systems, strong demand of notebooks. We expect this to continue. While we also expect some of the limitations that we have from a supply chain perspective, because of availability of components, to stay at least through the first half of next year. These are kind of the key trends from the revenue side. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: You commented a couple of times about a restock in printing. And I'm wondering if you can elaborate on specifically where, what magnitude and what parts of print supplies versus consumer or commercial hardware that was. It does look like the U.S. uniquely accelerated its growth rate in the quarter, whereas Europe and Asia were kind of flat to down. So was this rebuild in supply for channel partners largely centered in the U.S.? And I have a follow-up, please. 
Marie Myers: Toni, thanks for your question. Let me unpack the piece specifically around supply channel inventory. So there are a few drivers and there's a few different things going on in the quarter, so let me give you some context to you. So first of all, consumer demand, as you know, is being driven by this whole work and learn from home due to the pandemic. So it was offset by lower commercial printing. But in addition, we had better discipline in pricing in the quarter that was significant. And to put it in context, there were supply chain disruptions that we experienced earlier in the pandemic, and we've been doing some replenishment of our stock and channel partners in Q4 to help meet some of that demand from our customers. And we do expect to see that in Q1 as well. So -- and just in closing, finally, in supplies, we are below ideally where we'd like to be in terms of being below our ceiling on channel inventory. And maybe I'll turn it over to Enrique to give some context about... 
Enrique Lores: Yes. Let me address your comment about geographies, Toni, because when we look both at PC and printers in both hardware and supplies, our performance this quarter was more driven by supply chain than by demand. We are still limited in some of our -- in many of these categories from a supply chain perspective and the performance differences that you saw across regions were driven by how we allocated product not by where demand was coming from. We had very strong demand on the consumer front for consumer -- for PCs and for printers for every geography of the world. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. I'm going to use my follow-up to push a little bit on my first question. The supplies growth rate going from minus high-teens to essentially flat seems extraordinary. And it almost feels like in prior quarters, you drew down channel inventory. So that exacerbated how poor supply was because you didn't have availability. And this quarter, you replenished it. And all investors care about is, what is normalized supplies growth going forward? So it would be really helpful if you could speak to, specifically, how much restocking improved your supplies growth rate this quarter? And when we look to 2021, what is the realistic supplies growth rate for the year? 
Enrique Lores: Thank you for the question, Toni. As you know, we are not guiding anymore on supplies, but let me give you some color that I think will help you to understand in more depth what Marie was explaining before. 
 During Q2 and Q3, we experienced some supply chain shortages that reduced our ability to supply demand to many of our key resellers. And this definitely, during Q4, as demand has continued to be very strong on the consumer side and sellers have replenished their stock, this has been a tailwind for us in the business. We expect this to continue in the early part of 2021 because we continue to see very strong demand on the consumer side of supply.  This consumer demand is really driven by people working from home and kids learning from home, which we also think is going to continue still for a few quarters, which is one of the reasons why our guide for Q1 was stronger than what market was expecting, because we expect to see this to continue happening. 
 And finally, another element of the performance in supplies this quarter was the discipline in pricing that we drove. You probably have noticed that given the availability issues, we have removed promotions. There are very few promotions happening with HP supply. And this, combined with very disciplined pricing across the world, has also had a positive impact on revenue -- on supplies revenue this quarter. And again, some of it will continue -- we expect to continue in Q1. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: Congratulations on a nice print, quite literally, from you guys. I guess my first one is on free cash flow. The performance here, I think in October quarter, is certainly much better than what most of us had modeled. So I'd love to understand, how did October quarter free cash flow stack up versus your expectations? And I guess when I think about the underlying levers behind the free cash flow, was there any pull-in from the early part of next year that sort of helped you guys out? So I would love to understand the levers beyond the free cash flow strength and any sense on how we should think about qualitatively or quantitatively about fiscal '21 free cash flow. 
Marie Myers: Sure, Amit. Look, first, I would start-up by saying, look, we're really pleased with our results here and what we saw in the quarter. As you know, we drove $1.8 billion free cash flow in Q4 and $3.9 billion in FY '20. And it was a record actually in a single quarter since the split. So that cash flow strength that you saw was really stronger-than-expected due to higher earnings, and frankly, the benefits of working capital, particularly in inventory and AP. And as you know, as we look forward into '21, just keep in mind that typically, our Q1 cash flow is usually lower, given normal seasonality. 
Enrique Lores: But the key -- as Marie was saying, the key drivers of free cash flow in Q4 were the strong earnings that we had and the benefit from working capital that is really, in many cases, driven by the strength of our Personal Systems business that we have commented before. And we are very pleased not only with the results of Q4, but really with the results of the full year where we have delivered the cash flow -- the free cash flow that we expected to see before the pandemic and that we shared with all of you in our investor meeting a year ago. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I could just follow-up on the supply side, obviously, the performance is much better than what I think, what you're seeing in the industry or your peers are seeing. But I'd love to understand, I mean, is there a bigger share gain dynamic or even a better mix dynamic because you've talked about consumer and SMB a fair amount, and I would imagine they tend to skew more ink-heavy, which might be much better for HP versus not.  So could you just maybe talk about, is the mix shifting and that's perhaps giving you better sustainability for supplies as we go forward? I would love to just get better sense over there. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. Let me explain the dynamics that we are seeing in the print side. When we have 2 strong businesses in print, commercial and consumer, and our consumer business is getting a lot of benefit from people working from home, keep learning from home, and this has driven a strong demand for printers and strong demand for supply. Usage is above the expectations that we had before the pandemic started, and this is clearly having a positive impact in our business. On top of that, you know that our competitive position is relatively stronger in the home side, we have higher share of printers, higher share of supplies, higher share of pages. So as more demand goes to consumer, and to home, we clearly get a benefit from that. On the commercial side, we continue to see the impacts of the pandemic. The printing volumes continue to be significantly below where they were before the pandemic. Through the quarter, we have seen some improvement. But clearly, on the commercial side, still the pandemic is having a strong negative impact. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. 
Jim Suva: Congratulations on the results. I just have one question, and you can just answer it any manner you want. But the average life of a PC and also printers, it used to be kind of pretty consistent, I believe, around 4 years. Now that we're in a world of coronavirus and splitting time from school-at-school and school-at-home, and work-at-work and work-at-home, any thoughts about the average life of the PC? Will it be longer or shorter because you're using it in 2 different locations? Or how should we think about that as we go forward? 
Enrique Lores: Let me answer both, or what are we seeing for both PCs and print. In the case of PCs, more than the life of PCs changing, what we are seeing is a significant increase in the demand of PCs. PCs have become essential. People need it for working, for learning, for gaming, for entertaining for communicating. And the trend that we see is that for every person to have their own PC, and this is really driving significant demand on the PC side. On the printer side, what we see happening is both, we are seeing the additional demand for home printers as people and kids are learning and working from home, but we have also seen an extension of the life of printers because as people need to print, they are taking printers that have not been used for a while, and they are buying supplies for them, and they are using them. So you could position this as an extension in the life of the printers, which for us, of course, is a very positive impact because it means we allow people to enable people to print without having to invest in them buying a new printer. 
Jim Suva: Right. But my question is, once the -- everyone has a PC at home and a PC at work. After this has passed, any thoughts on the life of the PC after that essential purchase has been made? Do you think those kind of will still be the same length, or shorter or longer? 
Enrique Lores: I think we are still far from that position, Jim. We -- far from everybody having access to a PC in every -- in each of the countries where we do business. So we -- this is why we are confident that the demand for PCs is going to remain very strong during the next quarter. At the same time, in some areas, as you are saying, we are seeing there is so much need for PCs that PCs are being refurbished. Old PCs are being used. So we too could position as an extension in the life of the PCs. But we see this as a more short-term effect. What is really driving demand, and there is a long way to go, is the demand for every person to have their own PC. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I wanted to ask about your graphics and 3D printing business. I think you mentioned on the call that it was remaining weak, which was one of the impacts to operating margin in the printing business this quarter. How are you thinking about a rebound there? What are you hearing from customers in terms of willingness to take capital equipment or make capital equipment purchases? And perhaps maybe an update on your 3D printing business in general. And then I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So yes, we shared during the prepared remarks that both our industrial graphics printing and 3D printing overall continue to be impacted negatively by the pandemic. We have seen companies slowing down their investments in capital equipment and in industrial equipment overall, and this has impacted both businesses. What we have seen though is in many of the strategic areas that we have defined for those businesses, significant growth. We are seeing significant growth, for example, in labels and packaging, where both in flexible packaging and corrugated packaging, pages or, let's say, square feet and [ liters ] of ink are growing double digit year-over-year, which is a great confirmation that both that this business has a long-term opportunity, even if in the short term, it's been negatively impacted by the pandemic. 
 And I would make similar comments for 3D. The investment in printers is being impacted by companies reducing their investment, but we continue to see the long-term opportunity. And we mentioned in our prepared remarks, a very important introduction for us this quarter, because we have shared in the past that we see in the future the need to complement our business in printer and supplies with the ownership of some end-to-end applications for high-value applications. And with the launch of our solution to create tooling for molded fiber, we are starting to move in that direction, which will allow us to capture more value as customers will be able to do with 3D printing, things that were not possible to do in the past. 
Shannon Cross: Okay. And my second question is with regard to your new print model, the HP Plus brand, which you just started to roll out. I realize it's early. But I'm curious as to how the conversations are going with Staples? Any initial conversations you've had with anyone, what you've seen on hp.com? And I think there's a call with -- in next week or in a couple of weeks, but I'm curious what you can tell us. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. Let me start from that. Since we know this is a topic that -- where there is a lot of interest. We have organized a special session with one of the teams where they will go in a lot of detail both about the model, the progress we have made and the plans that we have to roll it out across the portfolio and across the different countries during next year. But let me give you a few highlights now. 
 First of all, we continue to be very excited about the opportunities that this new business model is going to create. We -- as you said, we launched this solution a couple of weeks ago in Staples. We launched 2 -- 3 printers, 1 laser printer and 2 ink printers, where we are starting to show the incremental value that it brings to loyal customers. So far, it's early to say what the reaction is, what we are encouraged by the initial responses, but we need to wait and see how it goes. But we continue to be very excited about the value this will create. 
Operator: Our next question comes from David Vogt with UBS. 
David Vogt: Maybe a little bit of a different topic. Can you give us an update on your structural cost reduction program? I think you mentioned on the call that you had exceeded your first year target of roughly 40% of the gross savings. What does that mean for year 2 and year 3 from a timing perspective and a magnitude perspective? And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Marie Myers: Sure, thanks. So as you know, that's actually my other role. And I would say, look, we're just very pleased with the progress and the program is very much on track. In terms of FY '20, we're ahead of schedule and higher, actually, than the 40% cost reduction plan that we'd originally highlighted. So I just would like to note that the OpEx reduction that you've seen this year were both a combination of structural and temporary reductions in areas like travel, events, et cetera, where we've been opportunistic because of COVID. So we are committed to staying on track and hitting our plans, and we do expect to achieve at least 75% of the $1.2 billion goal in FY '21. 
David Vogt: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. In terms of your cash flow dynamics balanced by sort of the macro uncertainty that you talked about in your prepared remarks, has there been any change in thought in terms of how you would think about deploying your balance sheet, whether it's a change in maybe your target gross leverage ratio? Or I know you raised your dividend? Or is there any other sort of potential changes in your thought process from a capital allocation perspective? 
Enrique Lores: Thank you. We continue to remain true to the principles that we outlined in the value plan. Let me remind them to -- everybody, so to make sure we -- everybody is on the same page. We increased our leverage -- our target leverage ratio between to 1.5 and 2. We have committed to return 100% of our free cash flow over the long-term, unless higher return on investment opportunities show up. And this is what we plan to continue to do in the future. In the short term, we have increased the amount of shares that we buy every quarter. We bought this quarter $1.3 billion of share. We have announced that we plan to continue to buy at least $1 billion of shares every quarter during the following quarters. We have additionally increased dividend by 10%. And what we have also decided is given the uncertainty that we still see in the world, we're going to remain, for the foreseeable future, in the low side of the leverage ratio because we think it's the right thing to be prudent at this time given that many things could evolve in the world in the last 2 -- in the next 2 or 3 quarters. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: I wanted to come back to supplies and see Enrique, if you could talk a little bit, you mentioned that you removed promotions, and that's had a positive pricing effect. I wonder if you could talk about how much of a pricing effect that's had on a year-over-year basis. And then I have a follow-up to that. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. We don't disclose the specific details. I can tell you, this has been one of the key drivers of the revenue improvement that we saw in Q4. And as I said before, we expect it to continue to happen in Q1 and the early part of next year. And also, I would say that from a share perspective, we are meeting -- if we put aside the geographical differences, we are also meeting our share goals that we announced a few months ago. And the combination of usage, higher pricing, good results and good progress from a share perspective and some of the onetime effects that Marie was talking before are driving the performance that we see in supply. 
Roderick Hall: Okay. And then my follow-up to that was the other side of that equation, the unit declines in supplies. I wonder if you could talk about whether those were similar to Q3? Or were they lower than Q3? 
Enrique Lores: I guess, you mean the number of pages in commercial? 
Roderick Hall: Yes.  Yes. 
Enrique Lores: So let me give you some color... 
Roderick Hall: Not commercial. Total supplies units, however you want to quantify that. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. So let me give you some color on what we have seen. During Q4, if we look at Q4 compared to Q3 and the number of pages printed, there is an improvement between Q4 and Q3. But if we look at the evolution month by month, during the month of -- the 3 months of Q4, usage has been fairly stable, similar to what we saw at the end of Q3. So improvement quarter-on-quarter, but not much improvement since the end of Q3. In fact, what we have seen during the last few weeks, and this is more a Q1 comment, as with the pandemic growing and the number of cases growing in many countries, we have seen, again, a slowdown in the number of pages printed in commercial customers. And this is something that, of course, is already -- is built in our guide and built in the projections we have made. 
Operator: And our last question today comes from Matt Cabral with Crédit Suisse. 
Matthew Cabral: Yes. You mentioned on the PC side that you're seeing some elevated backlog exiting the quarter. Just wondering if there's any way to quantify that and talk about how big of a drag that was on the quarter. And then thinking about the supply constraints from here, just if you can comment on where you're seeing the biggest bottlenecks? And how long you think it will take to reach supply-demand balance going forward? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me take the question. And I'm probably going to sound like a broken record because during the last 3 calls, I have been talking about the limitations that we have been facing because of supply availability. Let me tell you, this quarter, we faced significant. In fact, the backlog that we have at the end of Q4 is the biggest we have ever had. So it's not that the difference between supply and demand is being reduced, it's actually been increased. But it's all driven by increases of demand. Demand is easily driving. It continues to grow. And we expect that this situation will continue at least through the first half of our fiscal year 2021. So it's happening and it's here to stay at least for a couple of quarters. 
Matthew Cabral: Got it. And then speaking on PCs, it seems like there's a lot of moving pieces around margins heading into 2021. just wondering if you could talk about the puts and takes into Q1 and beyond on the PC side, and how we should think about things like the impact of Chromebooks versus desktops on mix and the impact of component costs going forward? 
Marie Myers: Matt, it's Marie. Maybe I'll take your question. So let me give you some color around the PS Q1 outlook. So we do expect those margins to be similar to Q4 back in the 3.5% to 5.5% range.  But I think a couple of points. First of all, the trends around work and learn from home are going to continue, and that will definitely continue to drive that mix to notebooks, and particularly into like those lower end ASP products. But we expect that to be somewhat offset by pricing discipline. And then from a revenue perspective, it will be slightly below normal seasonality given those supply constraints that we talked about, and our backlog will continue to remain elevated. So I think finally, supply chain is normalized, but there are some constraints around panels and CPUs, and this may impact our ability to meet that demand for notebooks.  Thank you. 
Enrique Lores: So thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. Before I wish you a great Thanksgiving for those of you living in the U.S., let me close with a few thoughts. What you saw during Q4 was the strength of the portfolio that we have. And the fact that we have a leading portfolio, both in consumer and commercial has really allowed us to deliver these results and to navigate the pandemic in a very strong way during the last quarter. We have also showed that the teams have really executed in this difficult time and they deserve a lot of credit in terms of their ability to identify opportunities, pivot the company and drive the maximum value that we could from those opportunities. We are very confident about Q1 and the guide that we provided today. Fiscal year '21 though, we have still a lot of uncertainty given where we are in the pandemic, but we know how to navigate the situation, and we know that -- and we are confident that we will continue to create value for our shareholders during next year. Thank you.

 Our strong Q3 results in the face of unprecedented uncertainty reflect the agility of our team and the strength of our portfolio. Our people have done a tremendous job rapidly adapting to changing market conditions and driving disciplined execution and cost management. As a result, for the quarter, we delivered beyond our expectations on revenue, earnings and cash flow, and we repurchased $1 billion of shares, well ahead of prior levels. Importantly, we are navigating the environment well and capitalizing on new opportunity. We are positioning ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our customers from the essential role of the PC in an era of dispersed workforces and classrooms to the rise of subscription-based business models and more personalized solutions.
 I consistently tell our team that times like these are when strong companies get stronger. This quarter results give me confidence in where we are headed. The strength of our strategy and operational capabilities will enable us to continue leading in both the print and PC categories.
 Today, I'd like to cover 3 topics with you: a summary on our third quarter performance; the progress we are making against our Advance/Disrupt/Transform strategy and our value plan; and finally, our current expectations for how the pandemic and other market dynamics will impact our business.
 In Q3, we delivered revenue of $14.3 billion, flat year-on-year and up 16% quarter-on-quarter in constant currency. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, and we generated free cash flow of $1.6 billion. Importantly, non-GAAP operating expenses were down over $0.25 billion driven by our ongoing cost reductions and lower discretionary spend. These are excellent results in the current environment.
 We continue to advance our leadership in Personal Systems and Print. In Personal Systems, we delivered growth in revenue, profit and share, and we delivered record unit shipments in Q3. The PC is more central to daily life than ever, and PC use is up more than 20% since COVID emerged. We are empowering remote workers and students with the ultimate office and learning experiences at home. This is fueled by a range of innovations that are keeping people connected, collaborative and secured. For example, in the quarter, we launched a broad new lineup of commercial EliteBooks and a new line of ergonomic monitors. Beyond work, nearly 2/3 of people say that PC is one of the main ways they stay entertained. And this quarter, we expanded our lineup of OMEN and Pavilion gaming PCs, displays and accessories.
 Turning to Print. The business performed better than we expected. Unit performance improved sequentially, and we addressed the supply chain impact of the factory closures we discussed on the Q2 call. More broadly, we remain uniquely well positioned given our leadership across both consumer and commercial print, our strength that's a clear advantage in the current environment. The shift to remote work and learning drove an uptick in home printing. We saw an increase of ink usage versus our original target. And we saw strong growth in HP Smart App users, with mobile downloads up 70% year-over-year. We also launched a new lineup of HP ENVY printer with a family-centric feature set. We also continue to evolve our business model. We expanded our Instant Ink subscription business, growing subscribers double digits. We expect to surpass 8 million subscribers by the end of the fiscal year.
 And we are connecting our Instant Ink and Managed Print Services systems to take advantage of the work-from-home trend. In Q3, we began rolling out the first phase of centralized billing for commercial employees printing from home. In the coming quarters, we will be expanding these offerings to enable frictionless print from anywhere for customers whose employees are not in the office full time. Importantly, in commercial printing, we did see some improvement as the quarter progressed. In Managed Print Services, July page volume was down roughly 25%, an improvement from April where we saw a decline of roughly 40%. While there remains much uncertainty about the phasing and pace of recovery, this is an early indication of office usage heading in the right direction.
 At the same time, we are making progress against our plans to disrupt industry with our technology solutions and IP. Across our industrial businesses, we continue to see attractive opportunities to drive medium- to long-term value creation. The benefits of 3D printing and the strength of our ecosystem have been clear throughout the pandemic. HP and its partners have produced more than 4 million 3D-printed parts for the health care sector. We also introduced a new 3D printing material and established an alliance with Oechsler, one of the industry's largest 3D parts manufacturers. While commercial business segments, such as graphics, have been challenged due to business closures, we did see attractive pockets of growth. Labels and packaging, for example, saw impressions increased 14% year-over-year.
 Moving forward, we will continue to capitalize on opportunities to create value for HP and our customers by delivering new end-to-end applications that enable highly personalized products and solutions. And as we advance and disrupt, we are transforming the way we work. Our focus is to unlock value and become a leaner, more digitally enabled company. We are well ahead of our cost reduction plans for the year, and we are making progress against the many initiatives we outlined last fall. We have extended our geographic simplification initiative beyond our sales organization, the supply chain and customer support. And to adapt, our channel program to today's digital realities, we launched a new partner program called Amplify in Q3. The program will enable enhanced data analytics and provide partners with the capability, tools and insights required to capitalize on opportunities across the whole portfolio.
 Overall, our Q3 results demonstrate the progress we are making against our strategy. Supporting this strategy is a set of financial principles that we outlined in our value creation plan. These principles include: the multiple levers we have to drive profitability, including our structural cost reduction program; our revised leverage target of 1.5 to 2x, maintaining an investment-grade credit rating; and our commitment to return to shareholders a 100% of free cash flow and excess cash over the long term, unless higher return on investment opportunities emerge. In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback, repurchasing approximately $1 billion in stocks. This is the highest level in a single quarter since separation. In the quarters ahead, we expect to maintain similar levels at a minimum. We remain fully committed to the principles of our value plan and are demonstrating concrete progress toward our goals.
 This leads me to the next topic: the trends we see in our business. In the home and consumer segment, we expect continued strength through at least the end of the year. Even as countries reopen, people will continue to spend more time at home. The commercial market will likely remain dynamic. In commercial PC, we expect the accelerated mix shift from desktops to notebooks to continue driven by strength in Chromebooks, particularly in education. In office and commercial print, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen signs of improvement. We anticipate the reopening of businesses will gradually increase the demand for printing and related services. That said, the phasing and pace of the recovery remains dynamic.
 I want to close on HP's culture. In tough times like this, it matters more than ever not only a high-performance culture that drives innovation as well as shareholder value but a purpose-driven culture that creates value for society and, most of all, a culture that unites employees with not only a shared purpose but also a commitment to doing what is right. In the face of a global pandemic and a long overdue reckoning with racial inequality, this has never been more important. And I am proud of the way our people and partners are stepping up and taking action to drive systemic change. During that time we saw much strife in the world, we have seen our employee engagement scores reach all-time highs. The HP culture is a source of strength that is guiding us forward. You will continue to see us take actions to drive a more sustainable, equitable and just future. It is not just the right thing to do, it is good for our shareholders. In 2019, our Sustainable Impact work helped drive more than $1.6 billion in new sales.
 Our results this quarter, the commitment of our people and the strength of our culture give me confidence in where we are heading. While we have lots of work to do, we see significant opportunity to drive long-term value creation. Our structural advantages, disciplined cost management and unwavering focus on the customer position us well to navigate current headwinds. And our leadership in both consumer and commercial uniquely positions HP to capitalize on opportunities across the business.
 With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to take you through the financial details. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Thanks, Enrique. We are pleased with our third quarter results, especially in light of our overall market and macro context. Our performance reflected the company's multiple profit levers, execution agility and resiliency.
 Third quarter net revenue was $14.3 billion, down 2% year-on-year or flat in constant currency. As expected, we saw growth in Personal Systems revenue and declines in Print revenue. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ increased 5%, EMEA increased 2% and Americas declined 4%.
 Gross margin was 16.7%, down 320 basis points year-on-year. The decline was due to a combination of a higher Personal Systems mix, a higher consumer mix within Personal Systems and a lower Print rate driven by volume.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.5 billion, down $274 million year-over-year. The OpEx decline is driven by our ongoing cost reductions program as part of our transformation efforts as well as a reduction in discretionary costs. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $42 million for the quarter.
 We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $32 million related to nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets, debt extinguishment costs and restructuring and other charges. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.52.
 Turning to segment performance. In Personal Systems, we delivered another strong quarter, growing share, revenue and profit dollars. The business demonstrated its resiliency following the impact of COVID on supply chain issues in fiscal Q2. In Q3, Personal Systems benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home with revenue of $10.4 billion, up 7% or 9% in constant currency.
 Drilling into the details by customer segment. We saw differing results with consumer revenue up 42%, while commercial revenue was down 6%. By product category, again, the results differed. Revenue was up 30% for notebooks, down 29% for desktops and down 30% for workstations. The change in mix reflects the strong demand for notebooks, mainly in Chromebooks, from the educational and consumer markets, respectively, as the shift to working and learning from home continues.
 Operating margins remained high at 5.5%. And operating profit dollars were up year-on-year to $570 million, representing 54% of HP's segment profitability. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of operating profit dollar increase as the team has effectively navigated headwinds and tailwinds during this time.
 In Print, we had anticipated a challenging quarter given the COVID impact on our commercial business, and the team demonstrated agility and strong execution, meeting or exceeding our expectations. Importantly, HP remains uniquely well positioned in the Print market by being leaders across both the home and office with longer-term growth opportunities across our industrial categories. This creates opportunities in this current environment and beyond to address the changing and holistic customer needs by providing innovative, secure and strong ROI value propositions across geographies and customer segments.
 Looking at Q3 demand, as we expected, we saw a decrease in commercial print across our office and graphics businesses. This includes a negative impact to both hardware and supplies as many businesses remain close and office workers continue to work from home in many geographies. On the other hand, in our home printing business, we continue to see strong demand coming from work from home. As a result, consumer hardware revenue grew 7% and units increased 3%, and commercial hardware revenue declined 37% and units declined 32%. Third quarter Supplies revenue was $2.6 billion, down 18% in constant currency as office and graphics printing were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, in Q3, the team remained disciplined in managing channel inventory, keeping Tier 1 channel inventory levels below the ceiling.
 In total, Q3 Print revenue was $3.9 billion, down 20% nominally and 19% in constant currency. And Print operating margins were 12.2%, which included a full quarter impact of office closures in commercial print and the corresponding volume declines. Operating profit dollars were $480 million.
 In general, we saw improvement in commercial print usage through the course of the quarter as well as our factories back to more normalized levels. Therefore, we remain confident that Q4 operating profit dollars and margin rate will improve sequentially. And that as volumes increase, our operating margins will return to our long-term target of 16% to 18% over time.
 Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and, specifically, our cost savings actions and opportunities ahead. Importantly, we're making good progress on our announced plans. We are currently tracking well ahead of plan in our 3-year program to achieve $1.2 billion in gross run rate structural cost reductions.
 To illustrate, we've seen significant operating expense reductions throughout the year with Q3 non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue at 10.6%. As we continue to generate savings, we are, at the same time, focused on improving effectiveness and speed. As an example, we have seen a positive impact driven across our centralized commercial organization and corresponding supply chain teams where, in recent quarters, we improved the speed and flexibility required to navigate the highly dynamic supply and demand changes across the globe. We are also making investments, especially in digital, which will help our overall customer, partner and employee experience in the quarters and years to come.
 During this dynamic environment, we are continuing to reduce discretionary costs as much as possible. While these discretionary reductions can be more temporary than structural, we will continue to focus on driving a lean cost structure to help us navigate.
 Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were strong at $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which helped strengthen our revised full year outlook. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle is down 4 days driven by more normalized purchasing and sales linearity, including decreases in days payable outstanding, days of inventory and days sales outstanding.
 In Q3, HP raised $3 billion of senior unsecured notes. This is our first corporate debt raise since 2014 and is consistent with our capital structure strategy communicated earlier this year. The proceeds have many benefits, including creating capacity to make disciplined, returns-based capital allocation decisions, including share repurchases; moving our debt maturity curve, including retiring approximately $1.6 billion of 2020 and 2021 notes, along with short-term commercial paper; and in the near term, during this dynamic period, providing additional balance sheet prudence. These actions incorporate our commitment to an investment-grade rating.
 Importantly, we are committed to a robust dividend and share repurchase program. We returned $953 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $251 million via cash dividends in Q3. For reference, these actions equate to buying back roughly 4% of HP shares in Q3 alone. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $2.5 billion, which represents 121% of free cash flow. Looking forward, in the near term, we expect to continue being active in the market and buy back shares at elevated levels in the range of approximately $1 billion per quarter at minimum.
 Heading into Q4, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook: we expect macroeconomic conditions to remain uncertain as we continue to monitor the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions, we expect continued strong demand in consumer and education with more caution in commercial, particularly desktops and workstations. We expect industry-wide CPU and panel constraints to negatively impact our ability to meet demand, especially for notebooks, which will constrain top line growth. We expect the cost from the overall basket of commodities to be similar compared to Q3 levels. From a margin perspective, we would expect Q4 operating margins to be lower compared to Q3 driven by mix changes but still be in the upper half of our 3.5% to 5.5% long-term operating margin target range.
 In Printing, we expect Q4 to improve relative to Q3. This includes units, total revenue, Supplies revenue, profit dollars and margin rate. We expect that our supply chain impacts mainly related to the earlier factory closures in Southeast Asia to be largely mitigated. From a demand perspective, we are still expecting commercial print to stay at depressed levels, with positive demand coming from home printing.
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We expect Q4 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54 and Q4 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.32 to $0.36. GAAP EPS includes the cost of restructuring, tax adjustments and onetime defined benefit plan settlement charges. We expect FY '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.16 and $2.20 and FY '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.87. We expect FY '20 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.
 And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Matt Cabral with Crédit Suisse. 
Matthew Cabral: I have 2 questions on PC. So I guess I'll just ask both at the same time. I guess the first one, I'm wondering if there's any way to break out how much of the growth you saw in the quarter was underlying strength versus just the backlog that carried over from April, and just any more incremental commentary about how to think about the demand picture from here. And then the second piece, you guys talked about Chromebooks a couple of times in the prepared remarks. Wonder if you could expand a little bit more on what you're seeing there, just how we should think about that relative to your mix and what that means relative to profitability of traditional PCs going forward? 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. Matt, so why don't I take a stab at this. So first, as it relates to demand, I think where I started is we still see very strong demand, particularly in notebooks, driven heavily by Consumer and Chromebooks. We also saw strong demand in commercial notebooks in Q3, and that demand continues to remain strong. I think the way to think about it is this year has a slightly skewed seasonality just given the supply chain challenges we saw in Q2, which certainly helped the backlog entering Q3. We still have a strong backlog on the notebook side. But the way to think about it is our second half of the year should be historically stronger than our first half. Or maybe the other way to think about it is, if we look at our Q4 outlook, our Q4 forecast is roughly in line with what we see a typical Q4 being as a percentage of the total annual revenue mix. As it relates to sort of the margin profile, we are seeing much stronger demand, again, on Consumer and Chromebook, and that does have a slightly negative impact on our overall margin rate that is factored into our Q4 outlook as well. 
Enrique Lores: And maybe only one additional comment. As we look at the next quarter, really, the key limitation is not on the demand side, it's actually on the supply chain side, because given the demand that we see in some specific segments, we really need to find -- need continue to find more components, processors and panels to respond to the demand that we see. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. 
Sreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Congrats on the strong whistle. The first question I had was on the Print business, do you think the business has broadened? Or do you think it's still tough to say given commercial is still depressed? And along the same path, are there any tangible milestones you can share as to how we can evaluate the subscription model on the Print business? And then I had a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. As I said in my prepared remarks -- and really as expected or better than expected was our performance in Q3 and our outlook for Q4. And so we are expecting improvement sequentially in our total revenue and our Supplies revenue in the total units as well as in the margin dollars and margin rate from Q3 to Q4. So said more directly, yes, we view Q3 as the trough. 
Enrique Lores: And as we look at the recovery, the recovery is really very aligned to the evolution of the pandemic. We have seen the regions where -- that are performing better versus the pandemic, have stronger performance, APJ. The regions where still the pandemic is stronger are the ones that still the impact is bigger, like the Americas. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: And on the subscription side, to, I guess, finish my thought there, I think one of the key things that we keep on focusing on is Instant Ink subscribers. And we started off the year -- if I reflect on SAM last year, just about a year ago, we were roughly in the 5 million subscribers. We're now over 7 million, would expect 8 million by the end of this fiscal year, which is, I think, a strong indicator of the shift to subscription model. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: I was hoping you could just elaborate or clarify a little bit more on capital return. So it sounds like you're saying you're going to look to buy back at least $1 billion in shares per quarter. Add your dividend onto that, that's about $1.2 billion in capital return per quarter, $5 billion a year. Your cash flow generation is $3 billion per year. So should we expect this for the next several quarters, meaning 3 to 5 more quarters? Or are you only commenting on fiscal Q4? And when we think about you have net debt right now of $1.4 billion, where are you comfortable, in absolute terms, taking that debt? And will you be looking to raise additional debt to facilitate this buyback? And I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So from a return of capital perspective, the principles we outlined at the value plan are clearly in place. That does include the significant return of capital. We do continue to believe our stock is undervalued. We are demonstrating our ability to generate strong free cash flow. This year, the outlook is $2.5 billion to $3 billion. I would say, historically, we've been at the $3.5 billion north level. I won't comment on future years at this point, but I think what you're seeing is the agility in our portfolio and ability to manage, it's a strong free cash flow generating set of businesses. That ultimately gets to where we are today. And we are kind of, at the same time, recognizing it's a dynamic economic environment. So we're taking all those factors in considerations.
 And we plan to be active in the market and buy back at elevated levels. It's at the approximately $1 billion per quarter at minimum, and we see that over the next few quarters. Clearly, if things change in the economic environment, we can update you on any change to the return of capital plans from there. In terms of sort of source of capital and your question around net debt, we do have comfort over time of having a higher net debt level and specifically even higher gross debt. And at the appropriate time, we have the opportunity to potentially access the debt markets again. We are still slightly below our leverage target of 1.5 to 2x, and so I think we just need to monitor the situation. And again, at the appropriate time, we do have comfort of going out and accessing more debt. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And I was wondering if you could just comment on the dynamics in terms of how you're thinking of sequential growth. So Q3 to Q4, you're typically up, as a company, about 5% sequentially. Now you could say if you're coming out of an economic recovery, particularly in printing, we should expect your revenue growth to be above that. You did seem to suggest, though, that perhaps there could be -- could have been some backlog benefit this quarter and could be some supply constraints next quarter. So when we're thinking about the puts and takes relative to normal sequential growth for both imaging and printing for Q3 to Q4, should we be thinking about something that is seasonally in line for each of those businesses? And particularly for printing, why wouldn't we expect it to be better than that given you're calling for a gradual recovery in folks coming back to work, et cetera? So if you could comment on each of them and the forces that work on sequential growth relative to normal seasonality, that would be helpful. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. And I think you're right to bifurcate between the 2 segments. And on the Print side, we are expecting above normal sort of historical sequential growth driven by the fact that we did see a stronger month 3 on the commercial side from a usage perspective than we saw exiting last quarter, and we're continuing to see strength on the consumer side. And while there's still some small lingering kind of ripple effects from the supply chain, the factories, again, are generally at normalized levels. So that gives us confidence in an above normal sequential growth on the Print side.
 On the PC side, we're expecting a below normal sequential growth. And that is driven by the 2 factors, I think, that we respond to in the first question. The first one being we saw sort of the skewed seasonal patterns between Q2 and Q3 and, therefore, have a much higher Q3 base that we would grow from into Q4. And then the second factor is it really starts with the demand, but we're seeing such strong demand on consumer notebooks. In Chromebooks in particular, we are supply constrained. And that does impact our growth in Q4. And therefore, again, we would see below normal sequential growth. You put those 2 together at the company level given Personal Systems was 72% of our revenue this past quarter that, at a company level, we would anticipate that Q3 to Q4 would have a below normal sequential growth at the company level. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Can you give us some more color around the page volume recovery that you're seeing in countries that have reopened or further in the reopening? And then how does that translate to a view around what the printer supplies decline will look like in the fourth quarter? And then I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me start with our global number, and then I will give more color per region. At the global level, as we shared last quarter, in April, we saw a decline on Managed Print Services pages, which is a good proxy, of minus 40%. We have exited July in a minus 25% range. So through the quarter, we have seen significant improvement. We have seen a constant trend. And this is really correlated to the situation versus the pandemic. In many Asian countries where the situation is much more under control, we see volumes close to where they were before the crisis. In the U.S. and in some of the Americas countries where the impact of the virus is still the strongest, they are still behind -- significantly more behind that number.
 And Europe is someplace in the middle. In the countries where economic activity is almost back to normal, we see usage level not at their previous level but very close to that. And what I'm talking is really the impact on the commercial side. On the consumer side, in the other side, driven by people working from home, kids learning from home, usage levels are, in most cases, above our original projections. And this balance on consumer and commercial is what really helps us and gives us confidence in what will be the evolution of this business going forward because we can hedge on the consumer side to really manage whatever impact we see on the commercial side. 
Kathryn Huberty: And then as a follow-up, just sticking with printing. In the context of the shift that you're seeing from commercial to consumer print hardware sales, what are you doing to improve the historical profitability of those consumer printer hardware placements as well as the NPV over the life of those printers? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Actually, let me clarify something. When we look at the business from a system perspective, the consumer print business is more profitable for us than the commercial print business. Hardware printers are less -- have lower gross margins, but the total business has higher profitability. So this is one of the reasons why this potential rebalancing is actually could be even beneficial for us from a margin perspective. Second, in terms of what are we doing, we are executing the strategy that we shared a few quarters ago in really evolving and shifting or rebalancing the profit between supplies and hardware. And the comments Steve was making about the growth of our Instant Ink business is a clear example of how we are driving that forward. We have seen an acceleration of the deployment of Instant Ink. We think this is a critical part of our strategy. And on the other side, the introduction of the printers with the new business model, we are on track to start having some of these printers in the market by the end of the year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: I have 2 as well. I guess, first off, Steve, I wanted to go back to the capital allocation discussion. How do we think about the duration of how long you will sustain this $1 billion buyback per quarter? And if I heard -- you guys talked about it, you said it's going to be at minimum $1 billion per quarter commitment going forward. If I recall, you guys have about a $14 billion authorization that's out there. So do I think of this momentum to sustain for the next 14 quarters quite literally? And then where does M&A fit into the narrative as well? 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. So I'll comment on the return of capital, and maybe Enrique, you want to chime in on M&A. The comments, they really are, I would say, more in the quarters ahead. Clearly, as the economic situation stabilizes in the time frame ahead, we certainly can update our view on return of capital at that point in time. But as we see it today, the $1 billion at minimum -- and again, if I just reflect on Q3 just given where our stock price is, that represented roughly 4% of our shares outstanding. And so anywhere between 3% to 4% of our shares, ability to buy back with that $1 billion at minimum. And so I would say that's really for the quarters to come. 
Enrique Lores: Then let me complement that because what we are doing is we are taking a prudent approach. We acknowledge that the overall situation is still fluid, and we think it's important to stay with a high level of cash in the balance sheet to make sure we have optionality depending on how things evolve. But at the same time, given the strength of our progress, we think we can maintain these elevated levels of share buybacks for the next quarters until we see a better -- until we have better visibility of what the evolution of the overall environment will be.
 Answering now the M&A question, I would say that we are going to remain very disciplined with our capital allocation process. We measure any action that we do on that front against a very rigorous return on capital process. And as we have shared before, any M&A activity we do will have to be aligned with the strategies that we have described. We'll have to have better ROI than other investments. And clearly, we believe that our shares are undervalued today. And third, we need to have a clear execution plan. This remains part of our strategy. But again, we will be applying that framework against any opportunity that we will consider. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. If I could just follow up quickly on the PC margin commentary for the October quarter, Steve, I think it sounds like it's going to drop down somewhat but be in the upper half of the range. Could you just talk about what are the reasons or what are the levers or headwinds you're having that margins are heading down? Because I get sales are sub-seasonal, but I assume they're still going to grow. So maybe just what other couple of headwinds you have on operating margin on PCs in October would be helpful. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. It's really just mix. And as we're seeing such a large demand in our consumer mix, and in particular, in Chromebook mix, it does have a slight downtick on our margin profile. I would say, over the long term, all of the actions and opportunities we have in mix remain: driving more displays, accessories, services in premium categories. But certainly, as we evaluate the demand and backlog that we see today, it is more heavily weighted to the notebook, consumer notebook, and that does have a downtick on our margin profile. So it's really mix. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I would like to take a step back and think about the printing business. If we went back to a year ago, which seems like ages ago after everything we've all been through, but if you go back, how have the work-from-home, learn-from-home trends changed sort of your outlook on the subsidized, unsubsidized business model you announced where you might want to be investing in graphics, the A3 strategy? I'm just kind of curious as to how you've looked at what your assets were sort of pre-COVID and then how do you think you're going to be able to leverage them after COVID since you had announced such a sort of large strategy change that, obviously, Enrique, you just said, it's going to be rolling out starting at the end of this year. And then I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. So the current situation is making that strategy even more important because as the consumer business becomes more relevant, and this is what has happened during the last quarter and we think will continue to happen during the next few quarters. Really, the importance of the shift into a model where we have profitability, better balance between hardware and supplies, becomes even more important. And also, as we shift into subscription models, our ability to maintain high share of HP original supplies is higher, which also makes that model evolution more important. So as we look at where do we see the business going? Clearly, winning in a stronger way in the consumer side is important for us. As I mentioned before, it has higher profitability. And actually, our share is higher. A higher number of pages printed in the office are being printed on HP printers with HP Supplies. So if pages shift to the home, it's a potentially positive trend for us.
 And one of the elements that we have added to the strategy is the need to connect the printers in the office with the printers at home. What we are getting from many of our clients, and I think I shared that in the previous call, is that they want to enable their employees to be able to print from home in a secure way and with the companies paying for that. So what we are doing is connecting our Instant Ink service offering to the Managed Print Services offering. We had already some initiatives that we did during Q3, and we are building the infrastructure to do that in a seamless way during the next quarters. But really, what is behind that is really the ability to print anywhere in a secure way with companies paying and funding that for their employees. 
Shannon Cross: Okay. And with regard to the A3 strategy, any change there? 
Enrique Lores: At this point, there are no changes there. We continue to have low share in the office. But of course, if the overall office market is lower, eventually, we may end up shifting some of our core focus to the consumer side, if this is the final trend that we see. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Two if I could, Enrique and Steve. Enrique, could you give us a sense of what your enterprise customers are saying sort of in general about their plans for coming back to the office. You've talked a little bit about that beginning and that's sort of shaking some demand loose but would love to get context there, and then also how you guys are thinking about small, medium business exposure as well. And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So what we are seeing in general is that many of the big customers are not going to be returning -- having their employees return to the office in the foreseeable future. We think this is a consistent trend across different countries. Though there are countries where the situation is better under control and, therefore, the number of employees is higher. And actually, it is very similar to what we are doing internally in the company. In many countries where situation is almost normal, we have our employees working back in the office. In other countries like the U.S. where the impact is still big, most of our employees are still working from home. So this is what we see really happening across the board with many of our large customers. 
Ananda Baruah: That's helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up, Steve, on the buyback, you did $56 million in this quarter. I think the blend -- sorry, the diluted was down just around $20 million. And so is that a matter of timing? Or was there some -- as the stock prices dropped, was there some dilutive impact to the -- dilution to the diluted shares? How should we think about that? And then also, do you have the ending share count for us as well, quarter ending share count? 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Yes. It's likely driven by timing in terms of sort of the accounting treatment on the fully diluted share count, it's dependent upon the timing in the quarter in which you repurchase those shares. We ended the quarter with 1.4 billion shares. We would definitely see that going down in the quarters to come given the larger and elevated levels of our buyback program. 
Operator: Our final question today will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: I just want to go back to kind of the supply chain and component cost dynamics. Could you help us appreciate or quantify the effect that you're seeing in the current business just last quarter and any kind of commentary you're expecting on that impact this quarter? And maybe a bit more succinctly, what kind of components are you seeing constraints on? Because I think we've seen kind of CPU constraints remain a headwind for quite some time, just curious of what exactly you're seeing there. 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: Well, I think the -- sort of the question or issue starts with demand. And again, we are seeing strong demand in, particularly, categories of our Personal Systems business, i.e., notebooks and consumer notebooks, and Chromebooks in particular. That is creating outsized demand. And therefore, when we look at supply, the areas that we see constraints are in panels and in CPUs broadly to fulfill that demand. 
Aaron Rakers: And on the component cost environment, your -- I think some of the component cost dynamics are starting to turn maybe more deflationary. So I'm just curious if why maybe you might not be seeing some of that? Or are you just being conservative in your expectations the next couple of quarters? 
Steven Fieler;Chief Financial Officer: We are seeing in certain parts of the basket of overall commodities and components some deflationary trends. There are other parts that are more inflationary or stable. When we put them all together, including the cost of logistics, we are viewing Q4 to be roughly at similar levels as Q3, again, some up, some down, but overall, kind of flat sequentially. 
Enrique Lores: Well, let me close now with some final thoughts. First of all, I wanted to kind of emphasize the fact that we have leadership position in both consumer and commercial markets for both Personal Systems and Print. It's a source of strength for us going forward no matter how the current economic situation evolves. And we are really focused on capitalizing on the opportunities that we see ahead of us. The PC has become essential. And as we have discussed today, this is clearly an opportunity for us. But also the fact that we see growth in home printing and home subscription services are areas that are going to be helping our plans going forward. Having said that, we remain very focused on executing our strategy. We are executing what we said we were going to do a few quarters ago, and we are very confident in our ability to continue to create value going forward. Thank you for joining us today. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

===== 2020 Q2  (2020-05-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2020 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ailee, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

 And now I'll turn it over to Enrique. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Beth, and thank you, everyone, for joining. Let me first say that I hope you and your families are healthy and safe. Our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic. I especially want to thank all the frontline workers who are showing incredible courage. I speak for all of HP when I say we are grateful for all they are doing. 
 The world has dramatically changed since our call in February, and we have a lot to cover today. I will start with a brief update on how HP is responding to COVID-19. I will then discuss the near-term impact from the pandemic and our Q2 performance. And I will provide updates on our strategy and our previously announced value plan. Steve will then take you through the details of the quarter and provide updates on our balance sheet, liquidity and outlook before we open the lines for Q&A. 
 So let me start with our response to the pandemic. We like to say that tough times are when HP's culture shines brightest, and that's exactly what we have seen in recent months. I am proud of the way our teams have stepped up to support our partners, customers and communities. Our top priority has been and will remain the health and safety of our employees. From the start, we quickly pivoted the vast majority of our people to work from home. For those in manufacturing, another critical function that cannot work remotely, we implemented social distancing along with additional safety and cleaning protocols. And as significantly, we have taken meaningful actions to remain close to our customers and partners. Specifically, we have implemented a variety of relief initiatives to help them navigate their operational and financial challenges. We believe this investment will further strengthen our relationships and support our value-creation strategy over the long term. But a crisis of this magnitude demand that we do more than simply protect our business. We must also protect the communities we serve. Our teams took immediate actions to deploy our technology and resources to address a range of urgent needs. 
 I will share just a few examples. HP and our partners have now produced roughly 2.3 million 3D-printed parts for face shields, respirators and other items for distribution to hospitals. And we are now ramping up production of 3D-printed nasal swabs with partners to help in the effort for mass testing. Because up to 60% of people currently working from home are using personal machines, we made Sure Click security software freely available through September to protect against cyber threat. And with almost 90% of the world's students out of school, HP and HP Foundation are donating millions of dollars in technology and grants to enable remote learning. As all our teams have adapted to new routines, I am proud of the way they kept the needs of our customers and our communities front and center. 
 Turning to our results. There is no doubt that COVID-19 is impacting our business. While some areas performed very well as people shifted to work from home, others suffered and we faced supply chain disruptions. Despite these challenges, we delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51. Revenue was $12.5 billion, down 11%, driven by macroeconomic and supply chain challenges associated with the pandemic. 
 Let me provide some context on the impacts we are seeing on both the supply and demand side as well as the actions we are taking to mitigate risks. I will start with supply. Both print and Personal Systems experienced manufacturing and supply chain disruptions during the quarter. As we noted on our February call, manufacturing in China remained shut down after Chinese New Year before beginning to ramp in late February. Starting in late March, we also experienced disruptions to operations in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world as the pandemic spread. We took swift action to adjust to this development, and our manufacturing capabilities were largely back to full capacity by early May. We will continue to monitor the situation for any other potential disruptions. Moving forward, we are evaluating plans to improve the resiliency of our supply chain, including increasing our levels of own inventory to help mitigate the risk of future outbreak. 
 On the demand side, there is no question that the lockdowns around the world have created new and different demand dynamics in the market. This presents both tailwinds and headwinds across our portfolio, and I want to walk you through what we are seeing. As people work from home, operate their businesses remotely and complete the school year online, we are playing an even bigger role in their everyday life. The current environment will have a lasting impact on the way we live and work, and it will further increase the importance of technology. For our business, this presents some attractive near- and long-term opportunities as well as some challenges that we will talk about. 
 In Personal Systems, we saw increased demand as organizations of all types and sizes focus on keeping people connected, productive and secure. This strong demand, combined with a constrained supply, resulted in an elevated backlog, which we expect to work down during Q3. Customers all around the world have been reminded of the essential role that PC play, and we are taking action to capitalize on these opportunities. During the pandemic, we have introduced some incredible innovation aligned to customer insight. For example, companies need to rapidly and securely deploy new devices to workers who are either at home or on the front lines. To meet this need, we launched new enterprise Chromebooks and Mobile Thin Clients. We also launched a new range of ZBook by HP mobile workstations and Envy notebook that empower creators. And just this week, we introduced the next generation of Elite PC and ergonomic monitors. We also launched dedicated services to improve employee experiences and help workers connect to the cloud and collaborate with colleagues. And with people spending more time at home, the PC also continues to emerge as a hub of entertainment. Gaming is the best example. And earlier this month, we launched a new lineup of OMEN PCs and displays. 
 In Printing, we are facing near-term challenges driven by both supply and demand issues. In commercial print, including office and graphics, we saw a significant slowdown in late March as offices closed and large events and trade shows were canceled. While we believe that office and graphics usage will rebound once businesses fully reopen, we expect that Q3 will be similar to April. And thus, we expect that our financial results will be more negatively impacted in Q3 than Q2. In consumer, we saw increased demand for hardware and ink supply as countries went into lockdown and customers set up home office and school environment. However, we were not able to fulfill all of the orders given the manufacturing disruptions. On the positive side, we also saw a surge in Instant Ink and now have more than 7 million subscribers accelerating the shift to services that we have been driving. HP's leadership across both consumer and commercial premium market makes us uniquely well positioned to weather the near-term challenges and emerge from the crisis stronger than the competition. 
 Let me now move to our go-forward strategy and value creation plan. We are continuing to execute the strategy that we outlined at our security analyst meeting last year, and we remain confident that it will deliver significant value over the long term. As a reminder, our strategy is focused on 3 key priorities: advancing our leadership in Personal Systems and print; disrupting industries with our technology and intellectual property; and transforming the way we work across HP to get closer to customers and reduce our cost. 
 We continue to make progress against our plan, and we are rapidly adapting to the new realities of the current environment. In Personal Systems, we are advancing our leadership with a continued focus on high-value categories and cost efficiency. As the PC plays a more integral role in people's lives, we see attractive opportunities to innovate with new hardware, services and solutions, including security and sustainability. In print, we are evolving our business model with greater focus on driving more balanced system profitability over time while also taking significant costs out. We see the opportunity to accelerate the shift towards services. For example, we believe in Instant Ink momentum and the broader shift to contractual will continue as work remains more mobile and location-agnostic even when the pandemic fades. In addition, our diverse portfolio across consumer and commercial affords a unique opportunity in the changing landscape. 
 We also remain focused on disrupting industries where our innovation and IP give us sustainable competitive advantages. While some of these businesses in graphics and 3D have been halted by the economic slowdown, we believe they will recover post COVID and they'll remain significant long-term opportunities for our business. Supply chain flexibility and resilience will be a priority topic for all companies going forward, and we expect digital manufacturing will be an important part of these discussions. This pandemic has shown the benefits of 3D printing, specifically speed, agility and localized production. This has led to deeper, more strategic engagement with customers as they evaluate their supply chain and consider more distributed manufacturing model. As an example, in April, one of our customers, SmileDirect, quickly pivoted during the pandemic from making dental aligners to producing personal protective equipment. 
 To deliver on our priority, we are executing our transformation program to become a leaner, more digitally enabled company, and the current crisis will actually help accelerate several initiatives. We are making significant progress in these efforts. Through the first half of the year, we are tracking ahead of our first year target to generate 40% of the total $1.2 billion in gross, annualized run rate structural cost savings. We are also taking additional actions to mitigate the short-term headwinds from COVID-19. These start at the top with temporary reductions in executive and Board compensation. We're also restricting external hiring and making further short-term reductions in discretionary spending. 
 As we navigate the current environment, we remain committed to the principles of the value plan we outlined in February. This includes the multiple levers we have to drive profitability, our revised leverage targets, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, including returning significant capital to shareholders unless higher ROI opportunities emerge. As it relates to the value plan targets, we are committed to the long-term goals we have set. However, given the extraordinary and highly dynamic environment in which we are currently operating, the timing to achieve these goals may change. When we have greater visibility on the macro environment, we will be in a better position to provide a long-term financial update. We believe this is the most prudent approach as we act in the best interest of our shareholders and all the stakeholders. 
 Before I turn the call over to Steve, I want to provide some closing thoughts. HP has always been fueled by innovation, collaboration and a purpose-driven culture. These are core strengths of our company that position us well in our market and drive our optimism about the future. And although there are challenges right now due to COVID-19, we never lose sight of the big picture. It is clear that the pandemic shot can also be a catalyst for change at the intersection of the digital and physical world from the increasing relevance of PCs in people's lives to the growing interest in 3D and digital manufacturing and the importance of playing across consumer and commercial printing. We continue to see significant opportunity for HP to drive long-term value creation. And we believe our structural advantages, disciplined cost management and then we're very focused on the customer position us well to navigate the current headwinds while capitalizing on new opportunities across our business. 
 With that, I will turn the call over to Steve to take you through the financial details. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Enrique. As Enrique described, we've experienced significant changes since our last earnings call. This is creating both challenges and opportunities across our businesses and geographies. Importantly, as we have seen over history, we believe the strong can become stronger in the years ahead, and therefore, we are not standing still. This requires leadership and agility coupled with strong execution and leveraging HP's foundational strengths, including our geographic breadth and scale, portfolio and customer segment diversity from the office through the home as well as our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. We have multiple levers of value creation in the company both in the short term and long term to adapt and manage the ups and downs in our business. 
 Now let's look at the details of the second quarter. Net revenue was $12.5 billion, down 11% year-on-year or down 10% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, EMEA declined 7%, Americas declined 10% and APJ declined 16%. Gross margin was 20%, up 60 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, down $136 million sequentially and $138 million year-over-year. We are seeing tangible structural cost savings achieved through our transformation program as well as the benefits of additional temporary discretionary cost actions taken in response to current economic headwinds. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $57 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.51 with a diluted share count of approximately 1.4 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes a net benefit totaling $23 million related to nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and other charges. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.53. 
 Before I get into the details by business, let me expand on Enrique's remarks regarding the supply chain impacts. I'll cover 3 points. First, as expected, we experienced manufacturing disruption early in the quarter due to the China factory closures. This impacted both Personal Systems and print. This created a back-end-loaded supply quarter and a higher Personal Systems backlog entering Q3. For reference, we recorded roughly 50% of our PS revenue in month 3, which is historically high. Second, later in the quarter, we began to see manufacturing disruption in Southeast Asia, which directly impacted our print business, both hardware and supplies, and we are monitoring any impact to PS component suppliers. Our print manufacturing capacity returned to normalized levels in early May, so the supply disruption should primarily impact the first part of Q3. Third, logistics were challenging. We have certain challenges delivering to our end customers and countries with full lockdown, such as India. And in general, our logistics costs were elevated. Altogether, Q2 was a complicated supply chain quarter, but our teams are highly experienced to manage through short-term disruptions. 
 Turning to segment performance. In Personal Systems, we are proving that the PC is essential. We are pleased with the profit growth of this business despite factory supply constraints that pressured our top line during the quarter. The business benefited from strong demand related to working and learning from home, particularly in notebooks. Revenue was $8.3 billion, down 7% or 6% in constant currency. 
 Drilling into the details. By customer segment, both commercial and consumer revenue were down 7%. By product category, revenue was flat for notebooks, down 18% for desktops and down 23% for workstations. Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profit growth and improved mix over time. Year-over-year commodity favorability, which was partially offset by higher logistics costs, drove another quarter of exceptionally strong profitability. Operating margins remained high at 6.6%, and operating profit dollars were up 43% year-on-year to $552 million. Personal Systems OP represented 50% of HP's profit mix for the quarter. We remain confident in our long-term operating margin target of 3.5% to 5.5%. 
 In print, we remain uniquely well positioned in the market by being leaders across both consumer and commercial print. However, we are facing near-term challenges driven by both supply and demand issues. Starting with Q2 demand, we saw a decrease in commercial print across our office and graphics businesses, especially in March and April. This includes a negative impact to both hardware and supplies as businesses have temporarily closed and office workers transitioned to working from home. Let me illustrate this with some additional detail that we don't typically provide. In Managed Print Services, we saw a roughly 40% monthly decline in pages from February to April. And in graphics, Indigo impressions went from being up 9% year-over-year in February to down 24% year-on-year in April. On the other hand, in an environment where much of the globe has moved to work from home, we saw an increase in overall demand for consumer inkjet during the quarter. 
 Looking at the details. Q2 total print revenue was $4.2 billion, down 19% nominally and 18% in constant currency. Print operating margins were 13.2%, down 280 basis points sequentially, driven by lower hardware and supplies volume especially in commercial print and a negative impact from supply chain disruptions and higher logistics costs. That said, despite our Q2 results, we remain confident in our long-term operating margin target of 16% to 18% once workers return to the office and demand improves. By customer segment, commercial hardware revenue was down 31%, and consumer hardware revenue was down 16%. Total hardware units were down 23%, with commercial units down 25% and consumer units down 22%. Second quarter supplies revenue was $2.8 billion, down 15% in constant currency. And office and graphics printing were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 lockdown orders in the last 1.5 months of the quarter. In Q3 and until workers return to the office and businesses reopen, we expect supplies revenue to be more pressured than Q2. Overall, in Q2, the team remained disciplined in managing channel inventory, keeping Tier 1 channel inventory levels below the ceiling despite the sudden demand declines in the commercial space. 
 Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings actions and opportunities ahead. A few points: First, we are making good progress on our announced plans and currently tracking ahead of the 40% first year target we set last quarter as part of our 3-year $1.2 billion gross run rate cost-reduction plan. Second, we plan to accelerate cost reductions as much as possible and look for new opportunities, including real estate. Third, we're taking prudent steps to reduce discretionary cost as much as possible. While these are more temporary than structural benefits, we believe it's the right thing to do in this environment. 
 Shifting to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were a negative $0.5 billion and a negative $0.6 billion, respectively. As I signaled last quarter, cash flow was negatively impacted due to the delayed manufacturing timing and back-end-loaded quarter in our business. That said, HP's businesses are strong cash flow generators over multiple periods, and we maintain a strong balance sheet to meet liquidity needs. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 34 days. Timing of procurement and production drove higher AP, inventory and other assets and liabilities. Accounts receivable increased both due to revenue linearity and also because of the payment extensions we're providing in specific cases to help customers and partners weather the crisis. We've returned $123 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $252 million via cash dividends in Q2. Our share buybacks were limited in the quarter due to the Xerox situation and closed repurchase windows. 
 As Enrique stated, the principles of our value plan remain in place. This includes how we manage our balance sheet, including the importance of investment-grade credit rating and our 1.5 to 2x gross debt leverage target. In the near term, we will be prudent to focus on managing through changing dynamics in our business operations as our top priority. Therefore, we expect to be at the lower end of our debt-to-EBITDA range and to hold higher cash on the balance sheet. Our return of capital principles also remain intact, including our commitment to a robust dividend and share repurchase program. In the near term, we expect to be active in the market and return greater than 100% of our free cash flow in FY '20. Beyond FY '20, we remain committed to returning 100% of free cash flow. In addition, consistent with our previously announced strategy, we intend to pursue a significant enhanced share repurchase program although the specifics will be determined once market conditions stabilize. We will update you in Q3 on how these plans progress. 
 Looking ahead, we would like to make the following comments starting with FY '20. Since the COVID-19 crisis started, we've been stress testing our model and running a number of scenarios based on a range of assumptions. For FY '20, given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the pandemic, the timing and pace of economic recovery and the potential impact of a resurgence in cases, there's a much wider range of outcomes for the year. As a result, we will not be providing an outlook for full year 2020. That being said, we expect our business to generate positive cash flow for the second half of the year. 
 For Q3, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing the situation remains highly dynamic. Specific to Personal Systems assumptions, we expect strong demand given the elevated backlog and surge from working and learning from home. We will closely monitor supply constraints, whether it be CPU or from other select commodity suppliers. And we expect the overall cost from the basket of components and logistics to be higher than we saw in the second quarter. In Printing, we expect Q3 to be more challenging than Q2 from a demand perspective until office buildings and businesses reopen. This will impact hardware and supplies, especially in commercial print. We expect continued positive demand for printing at home, but supply challenges from Southeast Asia will be constraining consumer print early in the quarter across hardware and supplies. As a result, we expect print revenue and margins to be lower in Q3 than Q2, with improvements beginning in Q4 following offices reopening. Taking all of these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: We expect Q3 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.45 and Q3 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.41. 
 In closing, our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity provide a solid foundation to manage through this uncertain environment while also providing capacity to capitalize on emerging opportunities, which we expect to arise out of this disruption. We will continue to take the necessary actions to manage through the near-term challenges while remaining focused on executing our strategy to drive long-term value creation. 
 And now I would like to hand it back to the operator and open the call for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Enrique, when you rolled out the shift in printer strategy back in October, you said that you would take in market feedback, which may cause you to either slow or accelerate the rollout of that strategy and the geographic expansion. How has COVID impacted the pace at which you look to shift the Printing strategy particularly given there is some discussion around more of a structural shift away from the office and towards working in the home? And then I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Katy. So actually, what we have learned in the last week has been very encouraging in terms of the changes or the evolution of the business model that we were driving in print. As we mentioned during the prepared remarks, we have seen a significant increase in adoption of subscriptions, which is a key part of the evolution. And this means that really supports the rest of the changes that we are going to be driving. As we announced almost a year now or 9 months ago, we will be launching the first products with a new model this fall and we are on track to make that happen. And as we said in February, the feedback we are getting from customers has been very positive, and we have been sharing that now with a significant number of retailers all over the world. 
Steven Fieler: And just to add to that from a contractual perspective, what we've started to hear from customers is because HP plays so prevalently in both the home and office -- and that's not just from a product perspective but that's from a services perspective, it's from a delivery perspective of how we can uniquely leverage our Managed Print Services offering with our Instant Ink offering to provide that sort of seamless transition from the home to the office with customers' employee base. 
Enrique Lores: Yes. That's a very important comment. We have been having lots of conversations lately with customers on what do they need to do to enable their employees to work from home. They ask for PC, they ask for accessories, and they ask for the ability to be able to -- for their employees to print, and this is a unique advantage that we have. 
Kathryn Huberty: Interesting. Steve, just as a follow-up, can you talk about what the makeup of inventory looked like at the end of the quarter, sort of PCs versus printers and component inventory versus finished goods? Which of those categories drove the increase? And then when should we expect to see inventory fall materially? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I mean our inventory both in terms of dollars as well as days obviously peaked here in Q2, coming from a lower base in Q1. It was driven heavily by the build in the Personal Systems space. That was really 2 factors. The largest factor was, as expected, the back-end-loaded linearity of the quarter. With the China factory shutdown early in the quarter as we headed to the back half, it just, by math, sort of creates a higher inventory in the back half of the quarter as well as all the in-transit. We did pursue some level of strategic buying on the Personal Systems side also in the quarter to set ourselves up for the second half. Looking forward, I would say that we are anticipating some level of higher inventory than what we traditionally held not to the levels that we are at today. And that's really more of a function of, in the short term, pursuing some resiliency particularly around ink or other products that we want to hold a higher balance with. We also did a pretty effective job around channel inventory and I said that broadly across hardware and supplies. While there's pockets clearly where we had to slow sell-in in the quarter as we reflect in our channel inventory levels, broadly speaking, we remain with a lot of discipline throughout the quarter on CI. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: I guess first off, Enrique or Steve, I just want to go back to the capital allocation discussion. If I got this correctly, the commitment is to return over 100% of free cash flow for this year and then 100% for fiscal '21, but you're going to pause on the outsized buyback program that was part of that $16 billion capital return program. I want to make sure I got that right. And what makes you un-pause this? What are the guideposts? What are you going to look for to go back to that outsized buyback program you talked about 90 days ago? 
Steven Fieler: Why don't I take that and I'll repeat a little bit and maybe add maybe a bit more context or color to the prepared remarks. But I think at the macro level, the principles of the value plan remain in place, and that includes how we manage the balance sheet, our target leverage, the 1.5 to 2x, the importance of investment-grade credit rating. Also, over time, we do see the opportunity to lower the cash on hand. That being said, in the short term, we think having a higher cash balance is prudent to ensure we can work through any economic cycle. We also see from a principal perspective the opportunity to drive free cash flow into the future, and we believe we're undervalued. So I take all of those in consideration. And then specifically in this current COVID-19 situation, there is just a high level of uncertainty. And we believe being prudent with our approach is the most important thing and therefore expect to be operating at the lower end of our leverage ratio and then get higher cash on hand. And navigating the business is our top priority. 
 And then as it relates to the actual return of capital, once we get through the different economic impacts from the pandemic, we're going to update you on the specifics. In the meantime, we do plan to be active, returning at least 100% in this fiscal '20 year. For '21 and beyond, we remain committed to the 100% of free cash flow unless there's a better returns-based opportunity. But I think the fundamental point is when we outlined those principles of how we want to manage a balance sheet, how that would ultimately free up excess cash and how we see the use of that excess cash to return it to shareholders all remains, but we really need to manage through this current situation. And clearly, as we look at the months and quarters ahead, we'll be looking at our business in the market in general. There's things that are in our control, but more importantly, we're probably looking at things outside of our control at the pace of folks moving back into the office and other social and health indicators of making sure we're getting through the situation. 
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. That's really helpful. And if I could just follow up. You guys talked about, I think, elevated backlog on Personal Systems very specifically, but is there a way to think about how big was this backlog and how long does it take to clear up? And I assume this is all about Personal Systems and not supplies, but just any dimensions and time line to clear the backlog that you just talked about? 
Steven Fieler: So Amit, I'll go first. So I won't size the specific backlog. What I'll say -- I'll make a couple of points. So first being we've had, from a historical perspective, the several quarters of high backlog just given the CPU constraints. What I'd say in the current state, the backlog has been even higher than what we've seen in prior quarters. Moreover, just from a linearity perspective -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks but it's a really important statistic, and that is we had 50% of our revenue in Personal Systems achieved in month 3 in April. That's historically high levels. And so as we saw the quarter progress clearly in the first month and 2, we were constrained by supply even though the demand was there. And then month 3, with the supply started coming more robustly online, we have a demand to go fill, but it really created a very high backlog situation by the end of the quarter particularly in notebooks. 
Enrique Lores: And what is even more important is not only what is the operational situation, it is what is our confidence about the business, what we have learned during the last weeks are that PCs have become even more essential than they were before for people working from home, for students learning from home, from kids playing from home. And our confidence in the medium and long-term for the business has yet increased. And whether it's for PCs, for accessories, we clearly see a very strong opportunity in this category. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on the PC commentary. So if you're seeing strong demand and you have backlog to fill, should we be expecting PC revenues to be up more than what they typically are in Q3 sequentially? So sequentially, you're typically up high single digits or double digits. I guess given all your commentary, that would suggest to me -- and given that you have a high level of inventory, that would suggest to me that you should be able to grow PCs on a sequential basis higher than that high single-digit seasonal pattern you typically see. Is that a fair interpretation? And if not, why? And I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler: So when we look at our Q3 expectations around Personal Systems, I won't specifically guide revenue. I will say that we do see the opportunity to grow above normal sequential. I think there's a lot of different periods, but I think if you look back in -- over multiple periods that we see the opportunity to provide upside on a normal sequential growth. That being said, we continue to monitor to make sure we've got the supply to fulfill all that demand. And while all the factories in general are -- have been back up and running, given that much of this demand is coming from notebooks and given the reliance on various component suppliers in the geographies in which they operate, it's important that we continue to monitor the situation. But from a demand perspective, we're definitely seeing demand to perform above normal sequential. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then I just wanted to follow up on the value creation plan. So I get the level of uncertainty. I think what you've been asked sort of 2 or 3 times in various forms this question. But let's say that this year is a tough year, obviously it's going to be a tough year, and you want to conserve cash. Let's say fiscal '21 goes back essentially to normal free cash flow generation levels, can we then assume that through fiscal '23, we should expect that you would buy back $13 billion worth of stock, which is what the announced plan, so the timing would get pushed out 1 year that you would buy back $13 billion worth of stock? And I guess the question would be why not. You announced this plan when the stock was at $23. It's now $16 and change, and so the proverbial expression of, if you liked it at $23, you must love it at $16 and change. So is that essentially what you're saying? Things are slowed down but you're committed to that magnitude over time. It's just going to be pushed out. So we should be thinking that order of magnitude, $13 billion through 2023, let's say, assuming the economy comes back to something close to normal in fiscal 2021. 
Steven Fieler: So this is how we're thinking about it. Again, the principles remain. And from a framework perspective, there's really 3 drivers, first of which is the leverage we take on. And while, in the current state, we expect to be at the lower end, certainly in a more steady state, we have comfort moving up in the range and taking on greater leverage and therefore bringing up cash. The second is our cash on hand, we finished with $4.1 billion of cash on hand. Again, in a steady state where we don't need to necessarily manage through such severe economic changes in the short term, we can lower the cash on hand, and that would also free up capital. And then the third is the free cash flow generation. And again, I guess to your question, as we begin to stabilize and the market begins to stabilize, we do have confidence in the multiple levers we have to drive cash flow. And as we get more visibility into that free cash flow projection, that clearly provides even further opportunity. We'll take all those into account to then determine the actual size and deployment of what the enhanced return of capital program could look like, but that's kind of how we're thinking about it. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross at Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I was curious what you've seen and heard from your customers recently as some of the countries in Europe have started to open up and then obviously some of the states, both on the Printing and the PC side, and if you've seen some improvement in terms of demand and flow-through. And I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. We -- this is something that we are monitoring very, very closely, as you can imagine, Shannon. What we have seen, for example in China where the recovery started earlier, is a fairly steady recovery both of demand but especially of usage of printing from the office and also in graphics. 10 weeks after probably the worst week of the pandemic, we are still not at the levels where we used to be but we continue to see steady progress. We have also seen some improvement in some of the countries in Europe where the crisis started earlier. We have seen that in Italy, starting to see it in Spain, but are very, let's say, small moves. We think during the next weeks, we'll start seeing more activity. We will see a similar pattern to what we have seen happening in China. 
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I kind of hate to ask this just because of what you went through with Xerox but I'm curious. The printing industry is obviously under both COVID as well as secular pressures in various places. How are you thinking about consolidation? I mean is this something that makes sense for you to be involved in? Or does it make more sense for share repurchase and perhaps looking at adjacencies or other areas where there's growth, like 3D printing? And I'm not indicating you're going to buy a 3D printing company but just in terms of technology. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So at this point, Shannon, our focus is on executing our plan. This is where it was 8 weeks ago when -- before the crisis started, and it is even more important now given the overall environment. We had declared and we continue to believe that in the office space, consolidation is a value-creation activity. But really, we think that now, what we need to do is stay focused on our business and continue to drive it forward. We are also monitoring other M&A opportunity not only on the core businesses but also on the growth side that we think, because of the crisis, might be available to us. But again, our focus is on execution of our plan. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan. 
Paul Coster: You're obviously tremendously successful in branding the value creation plan, and so we want to talk about it and we're all getting our naming conventions right as well. But if I understand this correctly, it's the leverage that is the compromise you've made in the context of what's going on here. It's not on the expense containment program and the severance and restructuring charges associated with that. Or am I wrong? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I mean if we sort of break down the various components of the value plan, there's the sort of return of capital, which I think we've discussed already on the call. And yes, that, to a large extent, is on managing through this situation with the right level of leveraging and cash on hand. As it relates to the other components of the value plan and specifically on our ability to drive operating profit dollars and free cash flow into the future, one of the primary mechanisms was the flow-through associated with our transformation program. And that transformation program called out for a $1.2 billion gross cost savings in FY '22 with $650 million of it dropping to the bottom line. As we sit here today, we have high confidence in the restructuring and cost takeout program and the structural reductions. In fact, we will continue to look for more opportunities, such as real estate and other activities. So we do remain committed to that. We also will continue to explore other discretionary cost takeouts. Certainly, in the current period, we have taken actions that Enrique highlighted across the company with certain salary reductions and such that we think is the right thing to do. And we're going to accelerate as much of that transformation earlier rather than later given we've got the opportunity to do so with the COVID-19 situation. So the short of it is, is we remain committed to the cost reductions that we have previously committed to. 
Enrique Lores: Let me emphasize this point because I think it's important. In terms of the financial goals of the value plan, we are -- we stay fully committed to those, both the profit that the businesses will create and also the flow-through that the transformation activities are going to create. There might be some timing impact given the current situation and given that 2020 is going to be a challenging year, but we see both upside, downside. It is, for us, too early to restate what is the timing of the plan, but we are fully committed to the financial goals that we shared and that we published in February. 
Paul Coster: And maybe this is a technical question. I understand that you do not intend to do the accelerated buyback using debt. But did you get authorization from the Board to proceed with that expanded buyback program? And have you the discretion to execute should circumstances magically improve all of a sudden? 
Steven Fieler: So as part of what we announced in February, we also announced that the Board did approve an authorization in total of $15 billion of share repurchase for the company. So there's plenty of authorization to pursue an enhanced repurchase program. 
Operator: Our final question today comes from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. 
Kanghui Ong: Awesome. So I just have a question on the guidance. It seems like the guidance for the EPS at the midpoint is about 20% lower quarter-on-quarter. Now I kind of juxtaposed this against your revenue. July has -- at least in the last 4 or 5 years, has averaged about a 4% quarter-on-quarter growth. Kind of seasonally, July is better than April. So I'm just trying to understand, is the guidance for EPS conservative? Or do you expect revenue as well to be significantly below seasonal and perhaps even down significantly quarter-on-quarter? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So why don't I kind of walk through some of the assumptions. I think maybe stating the obvious but it does remain a highly dynamic situation across both supply and demand. That's why we have a little broader range than we typically would for a quarter. That being said, I think it's important for us to be as transparent around the dynamics that we're seeing. And specific to Q3, the dynamics are different by segment and even different by categories within segments. So the assumptions are important. In Personal Systems, I already commented on the expectation for strong demand entering the quarter with high backlog. Therefore, we would expect to see positive sequential -- sort of above normal sequential growth as well as good year-over-year growth, assuming that we are supply-enabled. The overall basket of supply chain and logistics cost, we do anticipate to go up quarter-over-quarter driven by logistics costs. And then we're closely monitoring the shift in our unit mix and, in particular, the demand around notebooks and the work from home and learn from home, including the demand on the Chromebook side. 
 For print -- and this is really the substance, I think, of the Q3 guide to your question. We are anticipating that commercial print will remain challenged across both the office and industrial businesses. And this is a market-wide comment. We saw the negative impact beginning in March and more definitively in April as offices closed. Unlike Personal Systems where we saw a very back-end-loaded quarter for print, we saw just a bit over 1/4 of the business in month 3 given the slowdown in demand and our discipline on pulling back on revenue on the commercial side. As a result, we do expect a larger impact in Q3 across both hardware and supplies. And that's really the driver. And beyond the COVID-19 situation, we do expect to continue taking cost out of the business. But when you add it all up, what we see today is between $0.39 to $0.45. Clearly, we're going to be driving the business based upon the respective dynamics that we see, including where we can get supply. But the largest driver of the sequential decline is really that we've got more months in quarter 3 to deal with from COVID-19 than we did in quarter 2. 
Enrique Lores: And the key thing is that we see this impact as temporary, yes. So you know we shared some of these data before. For example, in Managed Print Services, we saw a decline of pages printed of about 40% year-on-year. It's a significant decline as people were not in the office and there were not pages printed in the office. We saw a significant impact in graphics. We went from growing about 9% in Indigo pages in February to decline more than 20% in April. Again, these are temporary impacts. As economy will recover, we will go back to a more normal position. But when we look at the impact in Q3, as Steve just said, we expect 2.5 months, 3 months of bad performance in these categories versus about 1 month. 
Kanghui Ong: Got it. Appreciate that. And as a follow-up, just kind of the longer-term question, it seems like every quarter, my model, I just -- operating margins on Personal Systems side just keeps marching up. It's 6, 7 almost quarters, almost 2 years now that that's marched up and now above your range. And then conversely, print, I understand the latest quarter in particular is a little bit different but in general kind of a downward trend now that the mix is 50-50, right? And when, historically, Personal Systems is probably closer to maybe 1/3 if not 1/4 of the profit mix between the 2 segments, at what point do you think it's structural? Or do you think that at some point, you get back to that historical range, whereby Personal Systems is that 1/3 versus print, that 2/3 mix? Or do you think it takes a long time, it's going to happen in short order? Or do you think we're kind of seeing a new norm here? 
Steven Fieler: Well, I guess we don't manage our business to try to solve for a respective mix. I think we're very pleased with the results from our Personal Systems business, and it's sort of by the end math that represents half of the company's profit. But to your question, we have been driving very good margins both from a rate, but more importantly, we've been driving very strong operating profit dollar growth in that business and certainly see the opportunities to continue executing in the higher end of that long-term range, which bodes well for a category where the PC has become even more essential. On print, I would say that Q2 in our -- embedded in our outlook in Q3 are really temporary challenges in the print margin structure. We're dealing with larger supplies revenue declines driven by commercial as well as commercial hardware declines. But once the market begins to recover and workers go back to the office, we would anticipate that those margins would normalize back into that 16% to 18%. And then longer term, as we drive our strategy to drive more profitable customers, to drive a higher mix of contractual, to further penetrate the developing markets with our big tank offerings, these should be margin-accretive opportunities for us in addition to the cost takeouts that we're driving. 
Enrique Lores: Let me take now the opportunity to close the session. As always, thank you for joining and thank you for your questions. I wanted to end up by saying that we firmly believe that HP is very well positioned for the future. Most companies are facing challenges right now, but the best companies are those that have not simply weathered the storm, they are taking advantage of the opportunities that we see and transform their company. And this is exactly what HP is going to be doing. We have many strengths, a very strong balance sheet, a diverse portfolio, very disciplined cost management. And several of the trends that we have seen during the last week are going to help us to make our brand even more relevant, even more essential for our customers. Our focus stays in executing our plan and continue to drive value for our customers. Thank you, and stay safe. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q1  (2020-02-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2020 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chuck, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to today's conference call. With me today are Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.
 We posted the releases and the accompanying slide presentations for both our fiscal 2020 first quarter earnings and HP's value creation plan we are announcing today on our Investor Relations web page at investor.hp.com. During the presentation of our value creation plan, we will be webcasting the accompanying slides.

For historical financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations.
 And now I'll turn it over to Enrique. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Beth, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. HP made 2 important announcements today. First, we shared our Q1 earnings results that demonstrate our incredibly strong foundation. We also announced a 3-year value creation plan that reflects the significant opportunities ahead. We have a lot to cover today, and frankly, I've been looking forward to this call for some time.
 We have a winning plan. Since becoming CEO of HP 4 months ago, my focus has been to deliver on the strategic priorities I outlined during our investor meeting last year. When I took you through our plans to advance, disrupt and transform, I made clear that we have multiple levers to drive shareholder value. And this quarter's results show that our plan is working.
 On the call today, we will first cover Q1 earnings and then go into detail on our value creation plan. We will also talk about the Xerox proposal and why it undervalues HP and creates risk for our shareholders. But as I said, let me start with Q1.
 We are out of the gate very strong. Our team is on a mission to out-innovate, out-execute and outperform. And it was an impressive quarter for HP. We delivered non-GAAP EPS growth of 25%, significantly above our guided range. We have now beat or met our non-GAAP EPS for 17 straight quarters. That's every single quarter since separation.
 We grew revenue by 1% in constant currency and non-GAAP operating profit dollars by 16%. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, and we returned 84% of that to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. These results show that we have the right plans in place to create value. We are advancing our leadership in Personal Systems and Print.
 Let me start with Personal Systems, where we grew revenue for the 15th consecutive quarter and we delivered exceptional operating profit. We are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth and outgrowing the market. This team is an execution machine, and we see runway for sustained value creation. We will discuss in more detail shortly.
 In Print, we continued making progress against our plans. Instant Ink surpassed 6 million subscribers for the first time. And we saw another quarter of solid growth in Managed Print Services. We're also disrupting industries by leveraging our technology and IP, particularly in graphics and 3D printing. In graphics, we announced an additional $100 million deal with ePac. And in 3D, we continue to make progress, bringing together end-to-end solutions for customers. An example is New Balance and Superfeet. They are offering customized 3D-printed caps for their insoles to consumers. They are using HP's FitStation and Multi Jet Fusion printing technologies.
 And as we advance and disrupt, we are transforming the way we work to unlock value. In the first quarter, we continued to drive operational performance by reducing costs and improving efficiency. We transitioned our sales force to a single commercial organization that is helping to accelerate our go-to-market. This includes global harmonization in areas such as pricing, and as we saw in Q1, the ability to allocate supply more effectively across the globe. Most importantly, this transformation is bringing us closer to our customers and partners.
 We are aggressively operationalizing our plans to take structural costs out of the business and are executing our plan to deliver 40% of our gross savings by the end of fiscal '20. We will discuss this further in the review of our value plan.
 Our Q1 performance gives us great confidence in our plans for 2020 and beyond. Before I turn the call to Steve, I want to briefly address the coronavirus situation. First and foremost, the well-being of our employees, partners, customers and their families is our #1 priority. We are following the processes and protocols outlined by public health authorities. We are also providing resources to assist with the public health response.
 From a business perspective, as you all know, the situation is fluid. We are actively working to return to full production as quickly as possible. We are working with our logistics providers to ensure we get the necessary capacity to meet customer demand. Overall, we are viewing the situation as temporary in nature and we are aggressively navigating the challenges.
 Let me now turn it over to Steve to walk through the financial results for Q1 and our outlook in more detail. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Enrique. Q1 was a very strong earnings quarter. We once again grew revenue in constant currency, non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and non-GAAP EPS even faster. We are off to a strong start with free cash flow, and overall, we are very pleased with our results.
 Now let's look at the details of the quarter. Net revenue was $14.6 billion, down 1% year-on-year or up 1% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ grew 4%, EMEA was flat and Americas declined 1%. Gross margin was 19.6%, up 180 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems as well as improved Print hardware gross margins.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion, down $104 million sequentially, resulting from significant reductions in SG&A driven by actions taken through our transformation program. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $44 million for the quarter. We delivered very strong non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.65, up $0.13 or 25% year-on-year, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares.
 Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share exclude net charges totaling $278 million related to amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and other and nonoperating retirement-related credits and other tax adjustments. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.46.
 At the segment level, in Personal Systems, it was a very strong quarter. Revenue was $9.9 billion, up 2% or 4% in constant currency. By customer segment, commercial revenue was up 7% and consumer revenue was down 7%. By product category, revenue was up 6% for workstations, up 2% for desktops and 1% for notebooks. The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as commercial demand remains solid while navigating the CPU supply constraints.
 Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profitable growth, share gains and improved mix over time. This, combined with disciplined pricing and supply chain favorability, drove exceptionally strong profitability with operating margins of 6.7% and operating profit dollars up 61% year-on-year to $662 million. Personal Systems OP represented 47% of HP's profit mix for the quarter.
 In Print, we continue to make progress on our key initiatives, including growing our contractual offerings, gradually shifting more system profitability to hardware and managing supplies, all within a softer print market context. Looking at the details. Q1 total Print revenue was $4.7 billion, down 7% nominally and 6% in constant currency. Print operating margins were 16%, up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by higher gross margins and reduced OpEx, partially offset by a lower supplies mix.
 Commercial hardware revenue was down 1% and consumer hardware revenue was down 13%. Total hardware units were down 10%, with commercial units down 12% and consumer units down 10%. The decline in units was driven by market softness, fewer sprocket units, along with our ongoing strategy to focus on more profitable customers.
 First quarter supplies revenue was $3 billion, down 7% in constant currency and in line with our expectations. We are executing against both the operational and strategic plans laid out in prior quarters. Overall, Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the ceilings.
 Let me now turn to our transformation efforts and specifically our cost savings opportunities. In Q1, about 800 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in October 2019. We continue to pursue additional cost savings opportunities in addition to our ongoing productivity efforts. We now have line of sight to $1.2 billion of gross structural cost savings that help mitigate headwinds, create investment capacity and drop significant profits to the bottom line. We will discuss our expected $650 million net OP flow-through in FY '22 later in this call.
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were very strong at $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. This gives us confidence that for the full year, we will land free cash flow between $3 billion and $3.5 billion, even with the short-term negative working capital impact from the coronavirus. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle is down 1 day. We returned $691 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $256 million via cash dividends in Q1.
 Looking ahead to Q2 and FY '20, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect that macroeconomic conditions will remain dynamic as they are today, and we expect our end markets to remain competitive. We're expecting currency to have about a 1% year-over-year negative impact. With regards to the financial impact from the coronavirus, we are factoring in our best assumptions at this time, recognizing that the situation remains highly dynamic.
 In Q2, we expect a negative impact to our top line, bottom line and free cash flow, although we view the impact as temporary with limited impact to our second half. In total, net of mitigations, we have factored in an $0.08 EPS impact into our Q2 guidance. We are also expecting to have a significant impact to free cash flow in Q2, with negative impacts to working capital due to delayed production and manufacturing timing and back-end loaded revenue linearity. Again, this should be temporary and not materially impact the full year.
 Turning to specific Personal Systems assumptions. We expect industry-wide CPU supply constraints to continue to persist, and we expect the cost from the overall basket of components to be less favorable compared to Q1 levels.
 In Printing, we're assuming a year-over-year unit market decline, and consistent with our strategy, we will remain focused on profitable customers. We expect operating margins to improve in the second half of the year versus the first half as cost actions are more fully realized.
 In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '20.
 Our FY '20 outlook assumes return of capital of at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders, consistent with our SAM messaging. However, we will talk later about our incremental return of capital plans, which would create upside in FY '20 and are not yet factored into our guidance. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. We are raising our full year fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.33 to $2.43 and our full year fiscal '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.13. We expect Q2 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.53, inclusive of our best estimates of coronavirus, and Q2 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50.
 And now I would like to hand it back to Enrique to discuss our value plan. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Steve. Our Q1 results show our company with an incredibly strong foundation, and the 3-year value creation plan we are announcing today demonstrates the significant opportunity ahead. We have multiple levers to drive value for our shareholders and a clear set of guiding principles. Specifically, we will intensify our transformation focus in taking costs out, manage our Personal Systems and Print businesses to advance their lead in their market and drive a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach.
 Our new financial outlook is expected to deliver $3.25 to $3.65 of non-GAAP EPS in fiscal year '22. This is underpinned by a rigorous operational plan. This management team has a proven ability to take costs out of the business while maintaining a disciplined investment approach today and for the future. We have also proven that this is a company and a team that delivers on its commitment. This is our culture. The strong earnings announced today are yet another proof point. You have every reason to share our confidence in the company and the opportunities ahead.
 Additionally, against this backdrop of strong performance, we believe additional value can be created through consolidation. In fact, instead of talking about being a first mover, we have been a first mover. Our acquisition of Samsung's printer business in 2017 is an important example. However, anything we consider and anything we do must, first and foremost, make sense for HP shareholders.
 Before I go into more detail on our 3-year plan, let me address the Xerox proposal and why we firmly believe that this is not in the best interest of HP shareholders. The Xerox proposal meaningfully undervalues HP. It creates significant risk, and it compromises the future of HP and the value of HP shares. Simply put, their proposal has a number of fundamental problems.
 The first is a flawed value exchange. The Xerox proposal does not reflect the value of our company or the plan that we announced today. The value exchange simply does not work.
 The second is that the proposal creates a highly leveraged and irresponsible capital structure. Considering the nature of our business, which operates with a negative cash conversion cycle as well as a macroeconomic cycle, this level of debt creates significant unnecessary risk. It's resulting debt-to-EBITDA ratio would be the highest in the S&P hardware index. A [ debt leader ], as Xerox is proposing, would virtually extinguish the capital returns that have been an important driver of value creation for HP.
 The third is the transfer of value from HP shareholders to Xerox shareholders. Their overstated synergies include many of the initiatives and cost-saving activities we are already doing. It is important to keep in mind that there is no overlap between Xerox and over 90% of HP's business. In addition, the Xerox proposal uses our balance sheet's strength to acquire our company, creating value for Xerox shareholders but not for HP's.
 Beyond these problems, we are looking at 2 very different companies. HP is a global leader in both Personal Systems and Print. Xerox has no presence in Personal Systems. Xerox' position in Print is not nearly as robust as HP. We are a technology leader. And with Xerox' exit from the Fuji Xerox joint venture, Xerox has no long-term technology or supply road map. HP has grown by $10.5 billion over the last 3 years. This revenue growth is meaningfully more than Xerox's total company revenue. HP does not need a Xerox combination to create significant value for shareholders.
 Now I'm excited to get to the most important news we are sharing today. The plan we are announcing shows the stand-alone value our shareholders can expect from us. More specifically, we expect to grow operating profit by approximately $650 million with realistic market assumptions and roughly flat revenue, to generate $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion of free cash flow and to return $16 billion of capital to shareholders. This represents approximately 50% of HP's current market cap and at least $8 billion to be returned in the first 12 months. Altogether, these plans would deliver non-GAAP EPS of $3.25 to $3.65 in fiscal year '22 compared to the $2.24 we delivered just last year.
 Our significant earnings per share growth will be driven by the principles I outlined at the beginning: aggressive structural cost reductions and ongoing productivity savings; disciplined management of our Personal Systems and Print businesses to lead in their market; and a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach.
 Now I want to spend some time talking about each of these EPS drivers. I will start with one of the core elements of our value plan, which is to transform our company with a relentless focus on costs. As we outlined at our Investor Day, we are driving efficiencies to generate structural cost savings. We have taken and are taking important actions that are driving measurable benefits.
 We expect our current cost reduction program to increase from the $1 billion announced in October 2019 to a revised plan of $1.2 billion of gross annualized run rate structural cost savings. We are also announcing today that approximately $650 million of these structural cost savings are expected to flow through to operating profit. As a result of these actions, as previously announced, we're removing 7,000 to 9,000 positions or 13% to 16% of our total workforce. And our restructuring dollars remain unchanged.
 Complementing these structural savings, we will continue to drive productivity actions across the company. We treat this as a separate bucket that we do each and every year to maintain our competitive position in the market. These include vendor management, material cost reduction, logistic efficiencies and more. Structural and productivity savings combined can generate more than $2 billion of savings as a stand-alone company.
 We have clear line of sight to deliver on these savings. We have defined projects across the organization to support our target with clear owners and time lines. Let me share some specific examples. I mentioned before the change that we are making in our sales organization. We have also consolidated marketing activities under one central global team. This is driving improved marketing spend efficiency and effectiveness. We are also creating efficiency in our business units and operations. We are changing our development processes, creating R&D centers of excellence and simplifying our hardware, software and firmware platform.
 We have also embarked on a process to optimize the location of our factories and distribution network. We are reducing the cost of our service delivery by reducing the number of call centers, building tools to enable remote support and aggressively improving our product quality. We will be driving down real estate cost by reducing the number of locations and increasing the mobility of our workforce.
 And finally, we are redefining and digitizing processes to improve efficiency of our back-office work. And at the same time, this creates better experiences for our customers, partners and employees. We anticipate that we will be achieving 40% of the annualized savings in fiscal year '20, 75% in fiscal year '21, and we will reach 100% of the savings during fiscal year '22. Reducing cost is a never-ending task, and we will continue to look for opportunities to drive efficiencies.
 Let me talk now about our business segments. Let's start with Personal Systems, where we are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth. Personal Systems represent approximately 2/3 of our revenue. As we discussed, we continue to outgrow the market, grow revenue and drive profit. This is a large and growing business that has further expansion opportunity with the next generation of customers and exciting new compute models.
 We have a winning strategy that's anchored in premium design, security and innovation to continue gaining share in higher-value categories. That's exactly what we have done the past 3 years, and we are still under-indexed in higher-margin segments.
 We're also growing the lifetime value of our installed base by broadening our ecosystem of displays and accessories and accelerating in services. And we have demonstrated meaningful progress in driving cost advantage across our platforms and our end-to-end delivery system. Looking forward, we expect to grow Personal Systems revenue at or better than market while expanding our long-term operating margin target to 3.5% to 5.5%. We feel great about the trajectory of this business and our team's ability to execute.
 Turning to Print. We have an incredible business in the large $200 billion plus print market. We are the market leader in size, scale, profit and innovation across office, home and graphics printing. And in a mature industry, everyone wants to be a leader. At the same time, we are still under-indexed in attractive categories like contractual in office printing. And as we drive a more consistent customer experience across our full print portfolio, we are confident that we will achieve significant cost savings and productivity gains.
 We continue to execute on our strategy to increase supplies share and to evolve our business model over time by growing contractual sales and optimizing system profitability with improved hardware margins. In addition, as I previously mentioned, we will also expand our solutions in graphics, 3D printing and digital manufacturing. This plays an important role in our long-term plan. And HP's decades of investment have created a leading portfolio of technology and intellectual property that we are monetizing to create new sources of value beyond hardware across key industrial markets.
 Across our Print segment, we are executing a strategy that will advance our leadership, disrupt industries and transform our business to improve our profitability. As a result, we are setting a long-term operating margin target for Print at 16% to 18%.
 Let me now hand the call over to Steve, who will go into more details on the financial plan, starting with optimizing the balance sheet. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Enrique. An important part of our value creation plan is driving a more aggressive balance sheet and capital allocation approach. We are establishing a new capital structure model with a target gross leverage ratio between 1.5 to 2x gross debt to EBITDA. In addition, we have announced a new capital return program, both in the short term and long term, which would utilize HP's balance sheet for the benefit of HP's shareholders.
 Our capital structure will still preserve our ability to pursue disciplined and accretive M&A and to continue to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. The plan builds on HP's strong history of returning capital to shareholders. Looking forward, we expect to return approximately $16 billion to shareholders over the next 3 years, with at least $8 billion of shares repurchased in the 12 months following our 2020 Annual Shareholder Meeting.
 To support this plan, the Board has increased the total share repurchase authorization to $15 billion, an increase from the $5 billion we announced in October 2019. This increased capital return will be funded by deploying excess cash on HP's balance sheet and available debt capacity. We remain committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We are also increasing our long-term return of capital target from approximately 75% to 100% of free cash flow, unless higher return opportunities emerge.
 We have a strong value plan, reflecting the significant opportunities across our business. It is a plan built on realistic assumptions, and it is a plan that combines operational earnings growth with enhanced return of capital to shareholders.
 I'll bridge our non-GAAP EPS from FY '19 to FY '22 in 3 parts, starting with the earnings contribution from our Print and Personal Systems business segments. We're expecting an increase of $0.41, plus or minus, from FY '19 to FY '22. This assumes approximately flat company revenue during this period, consistent with the growth across our weighted portfolio TAM. We remain well positioned to continue outgrowing our markets, improving our mix into higher growth and margin categories all while managing improved supplies revenue declines over the 3-year period. Importantly, the primary driver of the expected operating profit growth is the high-confidence $650 million net flow-through from our transformation cost takeout program.
 Second, we had $0.35, plus or minus, from shares and other using our previously guided 75% capital return. This base operational plan would generate between $2.90 to $3.10 non-GAAP EPS in FY '22 before any enhanced return of capital.
 Finally, we added the benefit from the incremental capital return program announced today, the upfront share repurchases, along with a 100% return of free cash flow target over the years ahead. This would generate another $0.45, plus or minus. In total for FY '22, non-GAAP EPS range is between $3.25 and $3.65.
 We hold ourselves to high standards, and it is the HP way to consistently achieve the goals we set. We take a disciplined approach to capital allocation, including M&A and return of capital. We have experience acquiring and consolidating as well as separating and divesting, and we have returned a significant amount of capital to shareholders. And we've done all of this while executing globally across both Personal Systems and Print portfolio and creating new businesses and revenue streams. That's the foundation we have built at HP. It's one that you can trust, and it is grounded in the purpose-driven values of making sustainable impact and doing business the right way.
 Now I'll turn the call back to Enrique. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Steve. The details we have shared today show that HP has a path to attractive value creation and a compelling investment thesis through execution of our stand-alone plan. Additionally, we believe consolidation on the right terms could create incremental upside to this plan for HP shareholders. HP is reaching out to Xerox to explore if there is a combination that creates value for HP shareholders that is additive to HP's strategic and financial plans. I'm confident in this next chapter of HP. We will be more aggressive, nimble and focused. And we have multiple levers for value creation.
 Now let me stop there and open the lines for your questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: Thank you for the detailed explanation of your strategy going forward. I wanted to follow up on the commentary that you made at the end, Enrique, about that you're reaching out to Xerox and I'm curious as to sort of steps. And then also what metrics would you need to see to pursue a deal? And you probably want to talk more generically but just in general, how are you looking at that? And how are you thinking about consolidation overall within the industry? And then I do have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Thank you, Shannon. I think any conversation we will have needs to address the 3 issues that we outlined during the call. First, we need to make sure that the value exchange between the 2 companies reflect the real value of each of them. Second, the resulting entity needs to have a capital structure that makes sense and that will be able to address the needs of the businesses that we will be running. And third, it needs to be based on synergies that are realistic and that can be achieved. This is a conversation that we think is possible to have at this point, and this is what we have opened the communication -- open the engagement to talk about. 
Steven Fieler: Just to quickly just double-click for a second on the 3 dimensions that Enrique described. On the first one on the value exchange, just to put it numerically, given our outlook, Xerox' offer today is roughly a 7x PE for HP. And if we look at consensus on Xerox over a similar period, they're, as of last week, in closer to the 9.4x range. So a striking difference in the respective valuations despite the fact if you look at our performance, HP has been growing and Xerox has been declining.
 The quick double-click on irresponsible capital structure. There's no hardware company in the S&P index with a leverage beyond 3.5x, and so we view it as irresponsible. Candidly, if we just reflect on the current situation with coronavirus and the working capital required to run our Personal Systems business, it's really important that you have that flexibility in your operating cash as we do today. And then the third one on the synergies, it's important that our investors get the benefit of HP's cost takeout program and not Xerox taking credit for it in terms of the synergies they're claiming. 
Enrique Lores: And let me add one more thing. Our #1 priority is to execute the plan that we have outlined today. We have an opportunity of creating very strong value for our shareholders, and this is what myself, Steve and the rest of the team are uniquely focused. 
Shannon Cross: Great. And then I just wanted to clarify that you're taking up your cost reduction to $1.2 billion and specifying $650 million flowing through to the bottom line. Kind of curious as to what you've seen that's incremental that's driving that. And also you mentioned $2 billion over time. Is that a longer-term target? Just any clarity there. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So maybe I'll clear up the numbers. So what we announced at SAM in October was a $1 billion gross run rate savings by the end of FY '22. At the time, we did acknowledge that that was to cover business headwinds to invest in the business, and we'd have some drop to the bottom line and we didn't quantify that drop. What we're announcing today is that that $1 billion goes up to $1.2 billion in FY '22 and not by the end of FY '22 and that there would be a $650 million net drop from that.
 The confidence comes really from the start out of the gate, given where we see the head count reductions that have taken place thus far, the continued work we've done over the prior 3 months. As we said, we'll always look at taking additional costs out, and we'll communicate them when we have line of sight. And so since we have line of sight, we've increased it to $1.2 billion.
 In addition to that, what we didn't specifically quantify in October but it's important for our investors to understand is we also have ongoing productivity initiatives and actions. This takes place every year. It always does at HP, where we see more than $1 billion of productivity. Think about this as vendor management, supplier management, pricing efficiencies, which we drive day in and day out. That's really used more just to make sure that we are competitive in our markets and our business. And so what's really important is the structural cost reductions, and that's now $1.2 billion. 
Enrique Lores: But as Steve said, as we said in October and we said it today, we will continue to look for opportunities to become more efficient. Removing cost is an activity that never stops, and we will continue to do that and continue to improve the efficiency of the company. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Commend you on the very aggressive capital return plan. In that context, maybe this is a question for Steve first. If and when the PC market growth turns negative, how do you plan to manage through the negative cash conversion cycle and the potential impact to free cash flow so that you can continue to meet this new share buyback commitment? 
Steven Fieler: Sure. Yes, I mean it's really a fundamental part of our overall capital structure. And as we said in the prepared remarks, our new target debt or leverage ratio is 1.5 to 2x. It's important that we maintain investment grade, and we have confidence that operating within that range, we'll do so.
 And the reason for that is a few-fold, one of which is what you just described. It's important that we can manage across economic cycles and particularly with our Personal Systems business and ensure that we have sufficient cash for operations. Also given what we've announced, we think our capital structure still supports our ability to invest and look at accretive, disciplined, value-based M&A and really take advantage of the financial and debt markets as they arise. 
Enrique Lores: And let me add one comment. Steve said in the prepared remarks, we have very realistic market assumptions that are supporting this plan. And basically, we are expecting flattish revenue. So this is also an important plan or the confidence that we have about this plan. 
Kathryn Huberty: So that actually connects to my follow-up. The operational earnings growth over the next 3 years is $0.41. That entirely ties to the $650 million of cost savings. So as you say, there's no revenue growth. There's no benefit from margin expansion as you mix into higher-value PC categories, as the supplies trajectory improves. And so just some context around why you're not betting that operationally, you can grow earnings beyond the cost savings over the next 3 years. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I would say, first of all, the plus $650 million is a plus or minus, right? And so we obviously have proven in the past few years our ability to profitably outgrow our market and also do so in categories where we're under-indexed and have higher long-term growth and margin accretive potential. That being said, we did want to take a realistic view of the opportunities in markets that we see. We do see and would expect certain parts of our portfolio to continue to grow. And we'd expect there will be parts of our portfolio that we continue to expect some declines, supplies being one of them, although we do expect that the supplies declines will improve over the period. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you for the presentation and all the detail. I'm wondering, you did talk about reaching out to Xerox to explore a combination. But it doesn't sound like you're open to being purchased by Xerox at any price, let's say, $30 a share or more simply because under any raised price, you would still have the same grievances. Is that correct? So are you -- if I literally follow your logic, it sounds like you're not open to being purchased by Xerox and Xerox having a majority control of the company under -- at any price. Is that fair? 
Enrique Lores: At this point, Toni, I don't think that who buys what is a real conversation. The real conversation is to make sure that if the 2 companies get together, we address the issues that we outlined during the call. First, we need to make sure that the valuation of the 2 companies is fair based on the value that both companies are going to be bringing to the joint entity. We need to make sure that the resulting capital structure makes sense for the businesses where we will be operating. And we need to make sure also that there is a fair, a clear assessment of what the synergies are. This is I think the important conversation for our shareholders. Once we clarify that, then who, how are things that will be discussed after that. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And if I could just follow up. Could you, A, just clarify what your expected supplies growth is through '22 in terms of decline per year? And then maybe you can comment on what feedback you've received from investors about this proposal. And the reason I ask is you're effectively saying what we outlined in October was $3 a share in 2022. And the stock market reacted with a share price of $17 or $18 for HPQ. Now you are effectively taking that up to $3.50, but it's not dramatically different and your stock price is up 33% since then. So I'm wondering, A, what feedback did you receive from investors over the last couple of months since the Xerox offer has come to be? And why do you believe that the market will view earnings that are 15% higher as being an entity that's dramatically higher value than the price they were willing to ascribe to the company shortly after the Analyst Day? 
Steven Fieler: So let me take a first crack at that. So I think there's a couple of things just to start with, the first of which is just to remind everyone, we did over-deliver on our Q4 results after our Analyst Day, and we significantly over-delivered on our Q1 results announced today as well as now 2 increases in our full year '20 outlook. So that's point one.
 Point two is what we didn't share in October, what we are sharing today is the underlying financial plan that is consistent with the strategy described at our Security Analyst Meeting. And that plan, in and of itself, is why we bridged it the way we did, would deliver between a $2.90 to $3.10 non-GAAP EPS in FY '22 before any of the incremental increased return of capital discussed today.
 So I think those are 2 important data points that have not been shared with our -- I guess the earnings beat has, but the value plan itself, this is the first time we're talking about it in this level of detail. And I think it's important facts and assumptions that would support the investor dialogue, which we'd continue to have and will continue to have. 
Enrique Lores: And when I got this question in the past, I always said that we were undervalued because our financial plan was clearly delivering higher value. And this is one of our objectives of sharing this today because now this analysis can be done openly, and it will clearly reflect what is the real value of this company. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: I have a few questions as well, and thanks for providing all the details over here. I guess, Enrique, when I think about the updated capital allocation narrative, I'm wondering, how does M&A fit into your thought process as you go forward? And specifically a question we get way too often is, will HP turn around and look to acquire Xerox at some point? So I'd love to understand, how do you view M&A broadly? If you can talk about this perhaps with Xerox specifically. 
Enrique Lores: Well, let me start and then maybe Steve will provide more detail. The way we have designed the capital structure will provide us flexibility to continue to drive accretive M&A with solid return on investments that will be aligned to the strategy that we have described. We have increased the debt that we are going to be taking, but still, we will have enough room to drive the M&A that we will consider appropriate. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I mean the only thing I would add is, again, we intend to operate between the 1.5 to 2x leverage ratio. It's important for us to maintain investment grade, and we believe that still gives us the capacity to do what's still an important part of our strategy, which is M&A. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And then if I just come back to the fundamentals in the quarter that you guys just reported. Supply that you feel like it's starting to stabilize, the down 6%, 7% range for a few quarters now. I'd love to understand your perspective on how fiscal '20 stacks up, especially because compares start to get ease in the back half with supplies. And then any feedback you're getting from your customers channel with the new pricing model? 
Steven Fieler: Sure. I won't kind of give any specific guidance as it relates to supplies revenue other than potentially to provide some color commentary. Certainly, as it relates to our 3-year plan, as I mentioned, we are still assuming the supplies revenue will decline, but we expect it to decelerate and improve over time. The reason for that, there's a few things.
 First of all, we're expecting that the supply share will improve throughout the period, reasons being our strategy. We're shifting more to contractual-based models, both in the home and office. Enrique commented that Instant Ink has now over 6 million subscribers. Number two, we expect to continue growing our industrial businesses, graphics, 3D. Number three, we expect to shift more of our customers to our end-to-end systems. Now this is going to evolve over time but that certainly should help supply share.
 And finally, operationally, we're driving changes we've talked about in EMEA but also executing some of the wins we saw on the ink side, where we've improved our supply share into the toner side. So those should all help our supplies trajectory over time. I would call out that we still have declines in installed base and especially in home. So there's definitely offsets to that, which is why we're still expecting a decline throughout the period. 
Enrique Lores: But let me emphasize one of the points that Steve made. As a consequence of the strategies that we are driving, we expect the Print business to be a much stronger business 3 years from now than it is today. We will have fewer unprofitable customers, and we are sharing some details about that today. We will have higher share of supply. We will have better hardware margins. We will have a higher percentage of contractual business, both for consumers and for businesses. And there will be a higher mix of growth businesses like graphics and 3D. So as we execute our strategy, we are really driving a significant improvement of the quality of the Print business. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Two, if I could as well. Could you just talk about with regards to coronavirus, specifically what's being impacted from a componentry perspective as well as a production perspective? That would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me start. So as we talk about the coronavirus, always our first thoughts is our employees, partners, customers and their families because we have a large number of them in the countries that are being affected -- impacted. At the same time, we need to acknowledge that if I focus on the business side, the situation is fluid. And our #1 priority -- our #1 problem is manufacturing capacity, both for Personal Systems, for Print hardware and supply.
 We are working very aggressively with our manufacturing partners and suppliers. I personally have been in contact with most of the CEOs to accelerate the recovery. We are seeing some improvement, but as Steve mentioned, we are expecting still to see some impact during Q2. 
Steven Fieler: Yes, I'll just -- I think it's important to reiterate that this is a dynamic situation. Our guidance just factors in the best information that we have today. We do view the situation as ultimately a temporary situation that we'll work ourselves through. As Enrique indicated, we are expecting that it would impact both our Personal Systems and Print business, hardware and potentially supplies as well.
 And in Q2, the impact will be felt across our units, revenue, profit and free cash flow. We have factored in, as I said in my remarks, an $0.08 net impact, a negative impact in our Q2 outlook. And we're not expecting any material impact in the second half. So that's what's assumed in our guidance.
 As it relates to free cash flow, I do want to note that given the delayed manufacturing and production, that is likely to make Q2 to be a more back-end loaded revenue quarter, and therefore, be negative to cash flow as well as from an inventory and days payable outstanding perspective, the timing of the manufacturing could also pressure working capital there. So it is likely to have a negative impact to our Q2 free cash flow results, again, temporary. 
Ananda Baruah: That's helpful. And just on cash, if I could squeeze one more in. What -- how -- is there an opportunity to the cash -- for the cash you'll be using for the share repurchase? And how would you like us to think about that opportunity cost? 
Steven Fieler: When you say cash, you're talking about cash flow or cash on hand? 
Ananda Baruah: Sorry. Well, for the cash that you could -- for the cash usage that you'll be using for the share repurchase. I just think that M&A potentially could be somewhat impacted. But would there be any other areas that perhaps you'd kind of pull back on investing in to let it flow to the free cash flow that you would then use for that share repurchase? 
Steven Fieler: Well, I mean obviously, we'll continue to look for returns-based opportunities to invest in. If we see those, we'll make those investments. If we don't see those, then there's always opportunities to drop more to the bottom line. We'll continue to aggressively lead in our markets, as Enrique said in his remarks. And again, if that leads to upside opportunities, that can drop more to the bottom line. That being said, our 3-year cumulative free cash flow outlook is between $10.7 billion to $11.7 billion. It's one of the strengths that we have seen in the past and would expect going forward, which is we generate a lot of cash at HP. 
Operator: And our next question will come from Paul Coster of JPMorgan. 
Paul Coster: First up, can you just talk us through the time line here for when the annual meeting is and when you'll have the discussion with Xerox and when you will take on the debt? And to what extent in this fiscal year the debt will be sort of front-loaded to enable the purchase of shares? 
Enrique Lores: Well, in terms of the date of the shareholder meeting, we will be publishing our proxy statement in the next week, and then it's when the date will be defined. In terms of the engagement with the Xerox team, it's something that has actually already started. And we will be reporting on that, but we will have to based on regulatory obligations. 
Steven Fieler: In terms of the debt, I mean the debt and the actual execution of the increased share repurchase, first and foremost, we're going to get out and engage with our shareholders. And we'll provide greater clarity in terms of kind of the timing and ultimately the structure and debt levels as we get closer to the execution. 
Paul Coster: Got it. Okay. My follow-up question is obviously, this is a really interesting value creation plan that you've outlined here. And if it's a good idea now, why wasn't it a good idea back in October? And what do you think you may have done by way of compromise in order to bring out the plan now versus back then? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So first of all, let me remember that when we had the investor meeting in October, I was still not the CEO and I have been the CEO of the company only for 4 months. During these 4 months, I have worked with the team, [ and all the team ], hard work to really look for ways to accelerate the value that we can provide to our shareholders. This is what we have presented today. And at the same time, we wanted to be able to demonstrate our ability to execute in Q1. We have done this today, presenting very strong results, and this is why we are having this conversation today. 
Steven Fieler: I would want to add that in the October time frame, we did announce the Board's approval for the largest share repurchase authorization in the history of HPQ as a stand-alone company, both in terms of dollars as well as a percentage of our market cap because as we said at the time, we did view our shares as significantly undervalued. So we did say that at that time. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Cabral of Crédit Suisse. 
Matthew Cabral: In your presentation, you mentioned roughly $1 billion of potential synergies created through the combination with Xerox. Can you just talk a little bit about how you arrived at that number and just the biggest differences you see versus the plan that Xerox has put out there? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. Let me take the question. So we have done a lot of work internally to, based in public information, trying to estimate those synergies. And also we hired a company that is specialized to validate some of our key assumptions. And we reached kind of the conclusion that Steve mentioned before that synergies are in the range of $1 billion.
 I want to remind everybody that the overlap between the 2 companies is relatively small. From our perspective, it's less than 10%. So really, we need to always have that in mind when we talk about synergies. Having said that, around 40% of the synergies will be in cost of goods sold. Around 60% of the synergies are in the OpEx side. This will give you a high-level estimation of the synergies. 
Steven Fieler: I think it's also important just to reflect upon the flow-through. And what we've heard is that there's an assumption of 100% cost flow-through to the bottom line that Xerox has proposed. It's certainly not anything that's being achieved today and their cost takeout plans. And so I think we've reflected on that. And again, I think it's important that whatever the synergy number is, it's an incremental synergy number and doesn't duplicate the cost plan that HP is already executing and candidly, that Xerox seems to be executing on their side as well. 
Enrique Lores: And this is -- a fundamental part is we are driving significant costs out of this company, and the value of that needs to go to HP shareholders. This is their money. This is why we think a big part of why the current proposal doesn't work for HP shareholders. 
Matthew Cabral: Got it. And then really strong EPS upside in the quarter, but it looks like your full year guidance went up by a little bit less than the first quarter beat. Can you just help us understand if there's any pull forward or anything onetime in the first quarter and why we shouldn't expect the margin upside to continue for the balance of the year? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So we increased our full year outlook by $0.10. I think what we've demonstrated is we do have multiple levers to drive profit at the company, and our outlook does assess the various risks and opportunities that we see. Maybe just a few high-level points. The first is we have factored into our guidance, what you see in Q2, the impact of coronavirus. We see it as a temporary issue at this point. Again, it's dynamic. But that is both in Q2 and does reflect our overall full year guide.
 In the second half, Personal Systems is going to have a tougher compare, whereas Print should show a better compare and year-over-year improvement. But also second half, and I think what's important is we do expect to see more of the structural cost reductions and savings, and we have increasing confidence in that. You factor all those elements together, which is why we increased the full year by $0.10, and we've got confidence in delivering that, albeit the coronavirus remains dynamic. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong of Deutsche Bank. 
Kanghui Ong: So I wanted to just put together a couple of breadcrumbs together and just kind of paint a picture here. So it seems like -- you mentioned you're reaching out to Xerox to talk about a combination, yet you've mentioned a repurchase, which appears like you're required to raise some debt if you're to complete in the quick manner you guided to. And finally, there's a commitment to this gross debt to EBITDA of 1.5 to 2x. How do we reconcile the idea that if you were to pursue a combination with Xerox, a combination of deal and repurchase could push you over the leverage that you've committed to? 
Steven Fieler: Well, I guess first and foremost, we've got a strong balance sheet, and we don't necessarily look at this as an either/or proposition. I mean our return of capital and capital structure is really designed to return significant capital, also preserve the optionality around M&A if it's ROI-based and disciplined and accretive to the company that could create value for our shareholders. Clearly, any specifics or hypotheticals really matter about what any potential transaction could look like, so won't comment on that. But our capital allocation will remain disciplined and responsible and strategically deployed to drive value for the company. And we think that 1.5 to 2x target leverage will allow us to do so. 
Kanghui Ong: Got it. Appreciate that. And one fundamental one, if I can. You mentioned a raise on both sides, Personal Systems and Print margins. I want to ask versus perhaps back in October. What gives you confidence in that raise? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. Our long-term margins for Personal Systems is fundamentally driven by the structural improvements we have made and would expect to be making in our mix. You've seen that underlying our results over the past many quarters, certainly, and the most recent quarter is also helped by some of the supply chain cost favorability. But the mix really helps and then the cost takeout. The cost takeout should help both Personal Systems and Print, both in the short term and long term. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. 
Rajagopal Kamesh: This is RK on behalf of Rod. I wanted to ask about the Windows 10 cycle. Where do you think we are? And could you comment on your expectations for commercial PC trends going forward? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. As we have said before, we are very confident in the trajectory of the Personal Systems business going forward. We -- there is a very large installed base that is -- that we can drive and upgrade to some of the new volumes, some of the new units that we have. And we think that we have an opportunity to mitigate any impact that the Windows 10 refresh may have going forward. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. And what we saw in Q1 was our demand remained solid certainly on the commercial side, and so I think that's an important factor. Ironically, I think the coronavirus may ultimately push out some of the Win 10 refresh time lines, given some of the constraints we're going to see in Q2, so that could support a better second half than we originally anticipated. 
Enrique Lores: Additionally, to some of the shortages we have seen on processors during the last quarter, so this really is smoothing out the transition to the new system. 
Rajagopal Kamesh: And on the coronavirus impacts, does your guidance include any impacts to demand outside of China? 
Steven Fieler: No, the guide really reflects the economic conditions as we saw today. And the demand impact was really China-based as well as the supply chain and logistics impact from the China production and manufacturing. 
Enrique Lores: And as we said before, the biggest impact is driven by the supply chain impact. That, of course, will have an impact in sales all over the world. 
Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Enrique Lores for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. 
Enrique Lores: So thank you, everybody, for joining. As you have seen during the call, we are very confident in the plans we have laid out today. We will build on our disciplined and sustained cost reduction actions to drive overall operating profit and cash flow across our business. And we will keep evolving so we can become a better, leaner, more digitally-driven company. My #1 priority is to execute the plan that we have outlined today. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. 
Enrique Lores: I am Enrique Lores, President and CEO of HP. Today, in addition to reporting strong financial results for the first quarter, we're outlining our plan to create value for our shareholders in both the near and long term. 
 In this video, you will meet key members of the team to help you to understand our position of strength and why this is the right team to lead HP forward. 
 HP has a clear strategy to create value for shareholders, and our strategy is working. We're advancing our position in Personal Systems and Print. We are disrupting industries with breakthrough technologies across graphics, 3D printing and digital manufacturing. And we are transforming how we work to continually optimize our cost structure and create the capacity needed to reinvest in innovation. 
 As part of our value creation plan, HP's Board has approved a new capital return policy that we expect will return at approximately $16 billion. This program will utilize our balance sheet for HP shareholders benefit. It will preserve our ability to pursue disciplined M&A as well as to continue to grow our dividend at least in line with earnings. You can also expect us to win the right way. 
 As a leader, I have always believed that how you do things is just as important as what you do. I am proud that Newsweek recently named HP, America's Most Responsible Company. Honors like this reflect our team's ability to deliver for shareholders today while paving the way towards a brighter future. 
Steven Fieler: My message today is about our confidence in the future. HP delivers on its commitments. We plan to deliver significant earnings per share growth driven by increased operating profit in Personal Systems and Print, structural cost reductions and ongoing productivity, combined with the right investments for our future, strong free cash flow and an optimized balance sheet. 
 HP's operational strategy and financial plans are based on realistic market assumptions, proven execution and leadership across our portfolio, cost reduction opportunities that are already being executed and growth businesses that already exists. We see significant operational upside ahead. Over the last 3 years, HP has returned $9.1 billion or 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. 
 Looking forward, our strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow generation provide us with multiple levers for value creation. We are highly confident in our ability to continue delivering on our commitments. 
Charles Victor Bergh: As Chairman of the Board of HP and an Independent Director, my responsibility is to ensure the right decisions are being made to drive long-term value creation. The Board and I take this very seriously, and I am proud of what HP has accomplished in this regard since the time of the separation. 
 This is one of the world's most iconic and most trusted brands with a highly differentiated technology and intellectual property, huge global scale and reach and incredible talent at all levels of the organization. HP is building from a position of great strength. Our multiyear plan includes 3-year financial targets, reflecting our unwavering commitment to shareholders. 
 To execute this plan, HP has a highly experienced management team. Enrique is the right leader to drive HP forward. The Board and I are united behind him as CEO. HP's Board is comprised of world-class directors with a diverse set of skills and expertise needed for a global technology leader, including in the areas of disruptive innovation, sound corporate governance, value-creating M&A, disciplined capital allocation and prudent cost management. The Board and I are very confident in HP's future. HP shareholders can count on us to continue delivering on our commitments to create value. 
Alex Cho: In Personal Systems, we are creating amazing new experiences for customers while driving profitable growth. Personal Systems is a large and growing business that has further expansion opportunity with the next generation of customers and exciting new compute models. We have a winning strategy that's anchored in premium design, security and innovation to continue gaining share in higher value categories. That's exactly what we've done in the past 3 years, and we are still under-indexed in these higher-margin categories. So we have room to grow. We expect to grow Personal Systems revenue at or better than the market while expanding operating margins to 3.5% to 5.5%. 
 This is a great time to be in Personal Systems. We are creating the compute experiences of the future. 
Tuan Tran: We have an incredible Print business. We are the leader in size, scale, profit and innovation in office, home and graphics printing. And yet, we're still under-indexed in attractive categories like contractual office printing, where we've led the industry consolidation. 
 In 2017, we acquired Samsung's Printing business. Having personally spent a year in Korea leading the integration, we were able to demonstrate cost takeout while driving incremental revenue opportunities. We're executing a strategy that will continue to advance our leadership, better deliver customer experiences and improve our profitability. As a result, we're increasing our long-term operating margin target for print to 16% to 18%. We will continue to be the most innovative printing company in the world, bar none.
 Graphics and 3D printing play an important role in our long-term plans. HP's decades of investment in innovation have created a leading portfolio of technology and intellectual property, and we're monetizing this portfolio to extend beyond the hardware by building a complete solutions ecosystem that unlocks new sources of value across key industrial markets. 
 We believe in the power of print, and we will continue to lead the industry forward. 
Christoph Schell: Our customers in 250,000 channel partners worldwide are at the center of everything we do. I talk with them every single day, and I can tell you, there's an incredible excitement about HP's future. Our new commercial organization places us closer to our customers and partners than ever before. We are driving operational efficiency through a consistent go-to-market strategy with globally standardized tools and processes, enabling a consistent execution of the 4 Ps of marketing. This consistency has contributed to the significant cost savings we are generating worldwide and has enabled us to become a simpler, faster and more agile company poised to build on our success and accelerate our momentum. 
 We are delivering more and more personalized services and solutions to meet changing customer needs. It is what we call the Segment of One. This requires us to harness new technologies to become a more data-driven company, which both enhances the customer experience and reduces our costs. Our customers and partners like where we are heading. We are reimagining what's possible, and we are enabling the outcomes that they need to be successful in the future. 
Enrique Lores: Our results reflect the kind of company we have built, laser focused on execution and delivering value to our shareholders over the short and the long term. And our 3-year financial plan shows that we don't plan to slow down any time soon. 
 Thank you for your support of HP. We are writing a new chapter in the story of this great company. And I know it will be our best one yet.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-26 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone. And welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2019 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Gary, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2019 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Enrique Lores, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before handing the call over to Enrique, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations website at investor.hp.com. 
 As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
 We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects the estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, and HP's other SEC filings. 
 During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago period. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. 
 And now I'll turn it over to Enrique. 
Enrique Lores: Thank you, Beth, and thank you for joining us today. HP delivered another strong earnings quarter, reflecting the strength of our innovation and execution, the progress we are making against our strategic priorities and the multiple value-creation engines across our company. 
 In Q4, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency. We grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars 5%, and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.60, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter where we have grown revenue, non-GAAP OP dollars and non-GAAP EPS. The fourth quarter capped off a very solid year in which we exceeded our targets for non-GAAP EPS growth and free cash flow. Our strategy is working, and we are confident about our business outlook heading into fiscal year '20. 
 For the full FY '19, we grew revenue 2% in constant currency, our third consecutive year of growth. We grew non-GAAP EPS 11% with double-digit increases for the last 2 years. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow, above our full year outlook, and we returned 85% of that to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
 We continue to lead in our core market with strong, disciplined execution, finishing the year shipping roughly 1 in every 4 PC units and 2 out of every 5 printers. These results demonstrate that we have multiple levers to drive operating profit dollars and create shareholder value.  
 And I want to be very clear, our focus remains on creating value for all of our shareholders and delivering for our customers, partners and employees. I have great confidence in the strategy that we shared at our Securities Analyst Meeting. It is confirmed by the progress we have already started to make in the 5 key strategic moves I laid out. 
 Let me recap each of them and share initial examples of the progress we are making. The first move is implementing a new operating model and driving digital transformation. On November 1, we went live with our new operating model and the creation of a single commercial organization to simplify our go-to-market structure. We have taken out the regional layer of the organization. This helped us to reduce costs, accelerate decision-making and be closer to customers. 
 We have also introduced a new business management system to streamline accountability. Second, we are delivering new compute experiences. HP is delivering the best innovation in the market. Recently, we launched our lightest commercial notebook, the Elite Dragonfly. With an ultra-bright screen and HP Sure View privacy, this device is purpose-built for the modern workforce, which demands flexibility to work anywhere. It is also the world's first laptop made using ocean-bound plastic, reflecting our continued commitment to environmental sustainability. It's another example of how we continue to set new standards in the PC category. 
 In addition, we continue to strengthen our commitment to security with the acquisition of Bromium, an innovator in endpoint security. Our belief is that every device decision is a security decision. With Bromium, we will be able to provide comprehensive protection against the most sophisticated malware and enhance our firmware and BIOS security layers. 
 Third, we are evolving print business models. Our contractual business continued to grow, with MPS and Instant Ink up double digits. And with over [ 5 million ] subscribers, the momentum in Instant Ink continues to build. At the same time, our big ink and big toner products extended their rollout, launching in Latin America and Central Europe. Importantly, the new transactional business model we introduced at SAM, which offers customers either a flexible or a full end-to-end HP system, is on track to launch new products by the end of fiscal year '20. And remember, this model will evolve over time.  
 Fourth, we are expanding our industrial businesses. In graphics, we see steady growth in pages printed. In fiscal year '19, in 3D and digital manufacturing, we more than doubled the number of parts produced with over [ 18 million ] final production parts across a widening range of applications. We remain on track to double the number of parts by the end of fiscal year '20. And we just helped Volkswagen produce 10,000 precision metal parts in just a few weeks to support the launch of their ID.3 electric vehicle. And finally, we are executing on our restructuring. We have initiated a voluntary early retirement program in the United States, and the take rate increases my confidence in our ability to deliver on our savings goal. 
 Let me now make a few comments on our business segment performance. In Q4, Personal Systems delivered another strong performance of revenue, operating profit and share growth. Revenue grew 5% in constant currency and operating profit increased 48%. 
 These results reinforce the strength of our innovation and disciplined execution against our strategy. We continued to outperform the PC market with broad-based growth across all regions and product categories. In calendar Q3, we grew faster than our competitors, gaining 1.2 points of share. While we are proud of these results, share gain continues to be an outcome, not an objective. We are delivering these results despite the ongoing industry constraints on CPU capacity, which are now expected to continue into the first half of 2020 and to be more impactful in Q1. 
 Turning to Print, we continue to execute our strategy. In Q4, total revenue declined 5% in constant currency. As we had anticipated, Supplies revenue remained soft. We're executing against both the operational and strategic plans we laid out in prior quarters. And as we said, into fiscal year '20, we expect our new commercial organization will drive better global best practices and consistency in Supplies execution. In fact, elements of the design and implementation of the new commercial organization are expressly focused on addressing some of the operational issues and leadership changes in EMEA. 
 As always, maximizing the value of our installed base is a core objective. We are driving preference for HP original supplies with targeted marketing campaigns that ensures that customers understand the quality, sustainability and security benefits of HP original supplies compared to the alternative. 
 We expect the combination of these actions to show improvement as we get further into fiscal year '20, and we remain focused on maximizing the value of our installed base. 
 In graphics, we recently closed another key win with ePac Flexible Packaging for an additional 24 HP Indigo digital presses as they continue the disruption of the global flexible packaging market. 
 Looking at 3D and digital manufacturing, we finished the year strong. Our business continues to grow, and the market acceptance of our new industrial 5200 solution has been positive. We are expanding our alliance ecosystem and building in production applications across key verticals, including automotive, industrial, consumer and health care. 
 I am pleased with our progress and look forward to delivering even more disruptive solutions in fiscal year '20. In closing, we delivered another good quarter, demonstrating our track record of execution. These results and the progress we are making gives me confidence in our strategy and the upside opportunities HP has for even greater value creation. Our plans to advance, disrupt and transform provide us with 3 powerful engines of value creation and supports a clear and compelling investment thesis. 
 We believe that the powerful combination of our scale, channel reach and incredible brand, combined with our track record of execution and innovation, will create significant value for our customers and our shareholders. 
 Now before I turn the call over to Steve, let me note that we will not be expanding on our previous public comments with regards to Xerox's proposal. Accordingly, we ask that you please keep your questions focused on the business and our results during the Q&A portion of this call as we will not be commenting on Xerox or its proposal. 
 Now I will turn it over to Steve to go through more detail and provide our financial outlook. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Enrique. Q4 was a solid finish to FY '19, where we once again demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver company results, posting growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating profit and EPS. 
 Before diving further into Q4, let me quickly recap FY '19 for the full year. We grew revenue, we grew non-GAAP operating profit dollars faster than revenue and we grew non-GAAP EPS even faster. These results show the strength of our financial model. 
 For the full year, constant currency revenue was up 2%, non-GAAP operating profit dollars grew 3%, with operating margin rate expansion in both Print and Personal Systems. Print grew margins by 10 basis points to 16%, while PS grew 120 basis points to 4.9%, and both within our guided ranges. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $2.24, an increase of 11% and above our guided range. We generated $4 billion of free cash flow, ahead of our full year outlook of at least $3.7 billion, and we returned $3.4 billion or 85% of free cash flow to shareholders. 
 Importantly, we delivered these results while investing in our business for future growth and efficiency opportunities. Our foundation is strong, including our balance sheet, and we have multiple levers to create value for our shareholders. This is what we said at our Securities Analyst Meeting, and this is what we intend to do. 
 Overall, we are pleased with our full year results despite more challenging industry, macroeconomic and geopolitical dynamics. 
 Now let's look at the details of the fourth quarter. Net revenue was $15.4 billion, flat year-on-year or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, APJ grew 7%, Americas grew 1% and EMEA was flat. Gross margin was 19%, up 1.4 percentage points year-on-year, driven primarily by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems as well as improved rate in Print supported by higher hardware gross margins. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up 11%, driven by increased investments for both growth and efficiency, including investments to drive future revenue and innovation as well as investments in HP's digital transformation. 
 Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.60, up $0.06 or 11%, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $21 million, acquisition-related charges of $21 million, restructuring and other charges of $105 million as well as nonoperating retirement-related credits of $14 million. It also excludes a net expense of $378 million for tax adjustments. This net expense is primarily driven by the termination of our Tax Matters Agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, partially offset by other tax adjustments. 
 As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.26. At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are again very pleased with our results. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.4 billion, up 4% or 5% in constant currency. By customer segment, commercial revenue was up 8%, and consumer revenue was down 4%. By product category, revenue was up 12% for workstations, up 5% for desktops and up 2% for notebooks. 
 The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as commercial demand remains strong, while navigating a softer consumer market. Personal Systems has been consistently delivering profitable growth and share gains over time. HP outgrew the market in calendar quarter 3 with strong execution, HP-specific innovation and a focus on exceptional partner and end customer experiences. 
 In addition, we see opportunities to improve our portfolio mix over time in areas of premium, displays and accessories and services. For example, this quarter, our revenue in retail solutions business and gaming, along with our services orders, all grew double digits. Q4 operating margins remained exceptionally strong at 5.3%, up 1.6 points year-on-year. The large increase was driven mainly by the team's continued execution of our strategy, balancing the industry's various puts and takes and remaining disciplined in a favorable commodity cost environment. Operating profit was $556 million, up 48% from the prior year. In Print, the business performed generally in line with our expectations for the quarter. We continue to deliver leading customer experiences, big progress in our contractual offerings, incrementally shift more profit to hardware and address our near-term operational challenges in EMEA. 
 Looking at the details. Q4 total Print revenue was $5 billion, down 6% nominally and 5% in constant currency. Our operating margins were down 0.4 points to 15.6% due to lower Supplies revenue. Commercial hardware revenue was down 2%, and consumer hardware revenue was down 10%. Total hardware units were down 9% driven by declines in consumer units, which were down 10%, with commercial units down 1%. 
 Fourth quarter Supplies revenue was $3.2 billion, down 7% in constant currency, again, driven by declines in EMEA. We are making progress on our operational improvement plans, and we've seen a significant reduction in Tier 1 and monitored Tier 2 channel inventory dollars in EMEA throughout the year. Overall, Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the reduced ceilings. We continue to make progress on our strategic plans to evolve our business models. We're seeing success in contractual as we grew both management service and Instant Ink this quarter. 
 Importantly, we remain under-indexed in contractual and are pleased that we continue to outgrow the market. Let me now turn to our transformation efforts, and specifically our cost savings opportunities. 
 At SAM, we described our plans to generate approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings by the end of FY '22, and that we continue looking for more opportunities. In Q4, we announced a voluntary early retirement program in the United States. More than 1,000 participants have opted into the plan, which will be effective through the course of the year. This take rate adds to our confidence in delivering both the FY '20 and overall planned savings targets. 
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were $588 million and $392 million, respectively. We generated $4 billion in free cash flow for the full year. In Q4, the cash conversion cycle was minus 31 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle declined 5 days, in line with normal seasonality, with a 6-day decrease in days payable outstanding, a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. We've returned $461 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $236 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the full year, we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and $1 billion via cash dividends. 
 Looking forward to Q1 and FY '20, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We expect that the macroeconomic conditions will remain dynamic, as they are today, and we expect our end markets to remain competitive. We're expecting currency to have about a 1% year-over-year negative impact. Specific to Personal Systems, we expect commodities to be significantly less of a tailwind in FY '20 than in FY '19, especially in the second half. We now expect industry-wide CPU supply constraints to persist through the first half of 2020. In Q1, specifically, we're anticipating a larger revenue impact than in Q4. However, we expect our mix to shift to more profitable units, which should largely mitigate the profit impact. 
 In Printing, we're assuming a year-over-year unit market decline driven by the home market. As a reminder, we are deliberately not chasing share, especially as we raise hardware pricing and focus on profitable growth. As described at SAM, as we progress through the year, we expect the net benefits of our transformation cost savings and other operational changes to begin to materialize. 
 In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '20. Consistent to what we communicated in October, we expect to return at least 75% of free cash flow to shareholders in FY '20 as we view our shares as significantly undervalued. 
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: Q1 '20 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.56; Q1 '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.39 to $0.42. We are raising our full year fiscal 2020 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.32, and full year fiscal '20 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10. 
 Operator, we can now open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: I have, I guess, a question and a follow-up. The first one, I guess, on Supplies, Enrique, I don't want to use the word stabilized, but we've been down 7%, I think, for a couple of quarters in a row now. Do you think we're starting to hit a bottom over here? And how should we think about the Supplies trajectory as we go through fiscal '20? And any feedback you've had from your customers and suppliers, I guess, broadly, in terms of the business model transition and the preference they have over here? 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So let me give -- first, let me help to frame the problem that we are facing in Supplies, and then Steve will provide some more data about what we see happening in the future. As we have shared in the past, we have 2 challenges on the Supplies side: First, we have what we call a strategic challenge driven by the growth of clones because of the lower pricing and the access that they have to the online space. But we also have an operational challenge in EMEA driven by the low visibility we had of some inventory in their unmonitored channel, combined with the aggressiveness of the clone competition. And we are making good progress addressing both problems. 
 On the strategy side, we announced our plan in the Securities Analyst Meeting to transform our model by evolving into services, accelerating the growth in big ink and big toner in emerging countries and, at the end of next year, starting to evolve our transactional model into both an end-to-end or a flexible model. On the operational side, we have also made good progress reducing our inventory, accelerating our growth online, getting better visibility of the inventory in Tier 2s, and as we said in the prepared remarks, changing our control processes to make sure that we have better business management processes in EMEA. Steve? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. Sure. I mean, I think to start, as I've said many times, our focus remains on operating profit dollars across the entire print ecosystem. But as really specifically to Supplies, Enrique mentioned, operationally, making good progress. We're seeing good indicators. Strategically, we're taking the right long-term steps. Q1 specifically, I guess what I'd say is we're planning prudently. Therefore, we're planning Q1 to kind of be more in the range of where we were in Q4, and that's embedded in our outlook and have confidence in the plan through the remainder of '20, and there's things that we view as tailwinds. We're shifting more of our business to contractual-based models, and that's across both home and office since that's stickier, higher share of revenue for us. We expect to continue to grow our industrial businesses across graphics and 3D. And as Enrique mentioned, we're making the right operational changes in EMEA, but also globally with the new commercial organization. 
 Obviously, we have some offsets. As you're aware, we have declines in the installed base in home. We're very well aware of that and obviously need to mitigate those declines and also the challenges we've discussed in prior quarters on the aftermarket share of Supplies. So we've got some pluses and minuses as we head through the rest of the year. And I guess, kind of -- that's how we view Supplies trajectory for FY '20. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess my follow-up, Steve, for you. $4 billion free cash flow this year, extremely impressive. I think it was better than what you guys were targeting. Can you just maybe bridge this for me and everyone, $4 billion in fiscal '19 to $3 billion in fiscal '20, kind of what are the puts and takes? And I'm assume -- and really to understand how much of the delta over here is transitory in nature versus structural. That would be helpful. 
Steven Fieler: Sure. So I've got a lot of confidence in delivering at least $3 billion, and that's our outlook for FY '20. If you just look back over the past 4 years, we've averaged a little bit over $3.5 billion each year. And this year, in particular, we do have a headwind, primarily as it relates to restructuring of roughly $400 million. As I mentioned at SAM, there's some other onetime favorabilities we saw in FY '19 that we don't expect to repeat. That being said, given where we ended cash conversion cycle in FY '19, I would view CCC is actually a help year-over-year. Our outlook for FY '20 is minus 33 days, and we finished FY '19 at minus 31. We'll need to see how the PS volume plays out in the second half. And I would note that the seasonality this year in PS may be different, given some of the industry dynamics. But altogether, I got a high degree of confidence in delivering the at least $3 billion on it. 
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I know you talked -- you said you won't talk about Xerox, so I won't ask that specifically, but in the conversations you've had back and forth and the letters, a couple of times, there's been a mention of strong balance sheet and share repurchase. So I guess, maybe can you take a minute to just talk about how you view your capital structure, uses of cash and, I don't know, your thoughts on sort of where investors are leaning or what the Board is thinking these days? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: And maybe just for starters, I do want to repeat maybe some of my comments at SAM and then sort of talk about where we are. As you're aware, we did update our long-term return-of-capital target at our Securities Analyst Meeting to return approximately 75%. That's our long-term target. And really, this is about a steady return profile for investors and supporting our business strategy. For FY '20 specifically, we're targeting at least 75% return, and that was what we said at the time, given our stock price significantly undervalued the business, and we have confidence in our outlook. We also indicated that our Board approved an incremental $5 billion share repurchase authorization. So we do have the flexibility to be opportunistic. Kind of bring it back up to, I guess, the point of your question around capital allocation, which we do view as an extremely critical management responsibility. In our framework, we'll remain disciplined. We have evaluated, we'll continue to evaluate ways with our balance sheet to create additional shareholder value. That could include M&A. It could include additional return of capital. As always, we'll compare the options using a return risk-adjusted view of each opportunity. 
Enrique Lores: And Shannon, let me emphasize the confidence we have in our plan. We explained our strategy during the Securities Analyst Meeting. We are making progress, and we are very confident in our ability to create value for shareholders, which is our key priority. 
Shannon Cross: And then maybe if you can talk a bit about the A3 market, what you're seeing there, competition and how some of your initiatives are going. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So A3 is a key element of our contractual plan. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we are making very good progress. In a flat market, we are growing double digit. And if we focus for a second on A3, we have grown 5%, where the market is barely flat. So very good progress. And I think this is really important because as we look at the future of the print business and the need to change, the opportunity we have to continue to expand and change the business model, growing in contractual is critical for us going forward. And this is really where our focus is and where really our focus will continue to be in the incoming quarters. 
Operator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and a follow-up as well. I was wondering if you could comment specifically on channel inventory over the course of this year. So specifically, if I were to look at this day a year ago versus today, how significant was your drawdown in channel inventory in terms of weeks? And what impact did that have on Supplies revenue growth this quarter -- this year, excuse me, in fiscal '19? And do you believe that Supplies revenue growth will be better in fiscal '20 than '19? And I'll do my follow-up after. 
Steven Fieler: So I'm assuming this is about the Supplies channel inventory and not channel inventory broadly. So let me kind of comment on where the Supplies channel inventory went this year. So throughout FY '19, we have reduced our channel inventory dollars by over $100 million. This is more than what we initially estimated. So we continue to make good progress. This includes both Tier 1 and parts of Tier 2, and note that we don't have complete visibility into the entire ecosystem. And so things are getting better. We do know, at the same time, the EMEA market has softened. So it's hard to bifurcate or specifically quantify how much of that channel inventory reduction was a result of starting the year off in a high position versus what was happening in the marketplace. What you should sort of think about it is at least $100 million channel inventory reduction on a year-over-year basis. 
 And as I mentioned, as it relates to FY '20, we do feel like there's things that are going our way from the contractual models, industrial businesses and the operational changes we've made, but we also have headwinds. And so we have to manage through the headwinds around the home side, have to manage the headwinds around ensuring we're protecting our share as much as possible. So I think those are all factored into how we're thinking about FY '20. We're taking a very prudent view, and that prudent view is factored into not just our Q1, but our overall FY '20 outlook. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. So no explicit comments on whether up or down relative to fiscal '19 in terms of what's baked into your guidance, Steve? 
Steven Fieler: As I said, I think we've got some headwinds and tailwinds. What we're driving is operating profit dollars in our print business. Obviously, supplies is a big part of it, but so is the shift more to hardware. We saw our hardware gross margins expand in Q4 as an example, and adding more services to the portfolio. So all together is what we're driving to focus on OP dollars versus just Supplies specifically. 
Toni Sacconaghi: And then just to follow up, you've stated repeatedly on the call that you believe your shares are undervalued and that you outlined a highly credible strategy at SAM. But prior to the Xerox announcement, the stock has traded at $17 or less since the Securities Analyst Meeting. And so I guess my question to you is, what is it that you think you see that investors are missing, given where the stock has traded at following SAM? And if you really were so confident that the stock has been structurally undervalued throughout the year, why did your SAM plan not include your deciding to take on debt and much more aggressively repurchase your shares? 
Enrique Lores: So let me start, and then I think Steve will complement. I think the key thing that we see, Toni, is a gap between the current value of the stock and the net present value of the cash flow projections that we have in our plan. And this is what drives our comment and thinking about being undervalued. What we have proven this quarter and we have proven in the past is that we have a clear ability to execute and that we deliver on our commitment. And our expectation is that by executing every quarter and meeting our guidelines, we will be seeing that gap to be reduced. 
Steven Fieler: And maybe just to add to that. What we did say at SAM, we did have a change in terms of our fiscal year '20 return of capital, where we communicated that we expect to return at least 75% and also announced an incremental authorization of share repurchase from the Board of $5 billion to give us the flexibility and opportunity to repurchase more shares. To note, in Q4, we did have additional material nonpublic information. I think that's obvious now. And so we were not as active in the market as we would like to have been. 
Operator: The next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: How are you thinking about first quarter '20 revenue performance versus normal seasonality, given the Intel comments about component constraints and your comments about not expecting an improvement in Supplies rate of decline? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So we are assuming that the CPU supply will constrain our revenue in Q1. And if you think about it on a sequential basis, certainly, in the Personal Systems business, we would expect to have declines from Q4 to Q1 above the normal seasonal patterns. That being said, well, this is more of a revenue impact than profit impact for the quarter as we expect our mix should be better. 
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just thinking more broadly over the course of fiscal '20. Steve, you had mentioned that you see the potential for different seasonality than in the past. How long are you expecting that the PC market strength associated with the Win 10 upgrade lasts? Does that continue well into the first half of the year? And how do you see seasonality falling off in the back half as customers complete those upgrades? 
Enrique Lores: Yes. Katy, I think the seasonality for next year is going to be impacted by the availability of CPUs. What we know now is that availability is going to be constrained for the first full half, and therefore, that will be having an impact on the seasonality between the second and the first half. So this is something that you really should have in mind as you build the projections for next year. 
Steven Fieler: And as it relates then to the Win 7, Win 10 refresh, it could be that these current supply constraints actually indeed help prolong the Win 10 refresh. And so there's a lot of dynamics going on, and that's why I think seasonal patterns are likely to be affected, both from a supply, but also on the potential extension of the Win 10 refresh. 
Operator: The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: I have a question and a follow-up as well. Just sticking there, Steve, some of the distributors actually believe, with regards to Win 10 and PC -- PC Win 10 refresh, that there's actually a long way to go for small and medium business customers, which is a meaningful part of your customer base, and not just chipset-related, but related to those -- those folks just tend to put off larger purchases as long as they possibly can. Do you have enough visibility to agree with that view or disagree with that view? And then I have a follow-up as well. 
Steven Fieler: I think, in general, we would agree with that view. I mean, there's a large installed base with PCs more than 4 years old. In our assessment, we're a little over 1/3 -- about 1/3 of which are still on Win 7. So there's an opportunity for upgrades. There's an opportunity for upgrades. We're seeing -- and Alex described this at our Analyst Meeting, that PCs are being used by this generation versus prior generations, and they're also using them for specific experiences. But -- so we see the TAM and our ability to gain share as a good opportunity, not to mention our ability to continue improving our mix. But the short of it is, we still think that there's some life here on that Win 7, Win 10 refresh that will extend. 
Enrique Lores: And let me reinforce his comments. I think the combination of our innovation and ability to execute have proven that -- have allowed us to grow faster than the market, and this is what we expect to continue to do going forward. 
Ananda Baruah: That's really helpful, guys. And just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned new -- for Printing, new models out by the end of fiscal -- I think you said -- you actually said '20. So could you clarify if that's fiscal '20 or calendar '20? New models for the new printer model, a new printer -- new hardware for the new printer model. Can you clarify if that's fiscal '20 or calendar? 
 And then just how does that fit in -- I guess the broader question is, how does that fit into you guys being able to really make an impact with the business model shift, waiting for those new models? 
Enrique Lores: So let me start from the second question and then I will go back to the details of the first. As we shared during SAM, the change of business model in print is driven by 3 different vectors. First is a shift into services, both into managed print services and Instant Ink. This offers a better value proposition to customers, and this is a change that we have been driving for some time in the past and where we are growing double digit. Second element of the change is the growth in emerging countries of the big ink and big toner category. Big ink has been in the market for some time. We are growing. And we are the only company that offers a big toner solution, and we have continued the rollout of this solution during the last month. And only the last part of the change is really driven by the new model for transactional customers. This new model, as you said, will be available in the market at the end of the year during our calendar Q4. 
Operator: Your next question is from Matt Cabral with Crédit Suisse. 
Matthew Cabral: Enrique, maybe to pick up on your last answer. You mentioned the initial rollout of big ink and big toner in other emerging markets. Just wondering if you could talk about what the initial customer and competitive response has been so far, and just how you're thinking about the geographic rollout of that model more broadly across your portfolio. 
Enrique Lores: Sure. So the reception has been positive. As I said before, big ink has been in the market for some time and we have been growing our share. Big toner is a category that we are creating, and we started the launch a few months ago. And as we go into more countries, we continue to see the growth. Reception is very positive because in those countries, usually, consumption is high. We have lower share of [ original ] supply. And therefore, for us, it's a better model and it's also a better model for our customers. 
Matthew Cabral: And then, Steve, on Personal Systems, margins were once again above 5% in the quarter. Just wondering if you could bridge how much of the year-over-year improvement was the tailwinds from component pricing versus just other underlying improvement, and just how we should think about that impact from component pricing as we move through fiscal '20. 
Steven Fieler: Yes, it's fair to assume that some level of the profit margin rate in dollars did come from that. But it really is on the backs of how we execute our strategy and overall pricing discipline. There's a lot of puts and takes to pricing. Obviously, commodities have been favorable for us. Overall, currency has been a headwind for us. And so as you take it all into consideration, in addition to the competitive dynamics, it's hard to specifically quantify how much of that sort of exceptional performance was due to the commodities. As we sort of think about FY '20, certainly even from Q4 to Q1, we'd expect the commodity costs to be a bit more stable. And therefore, I don't expect as much tailwind in Q1 and certainly as we enter into the second half as we saw this year. That being said, we continue to have a more structural opportunity to improve our mix. And again, the team deserves a lot of credit for remaining disciplined in the overall pricing strategy. 
Operator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: Just kind of building on that last question. I have a follow-up as well. Thinking about setting component pricing to the side and thinking about the mix shift of the business, it does look like your ASP erosion on particularly your notebooks has kind of accelerated here a little bit. I'm just kind of wanting to understand how I would think about the mix shift dynamic underneath of that. Any metrics you can share of how successful you've been in terms of mix shifting within the PC portfolio and where you think the biggest incremental levers are to continue to see that mix shift going forward as component pricing starts to stabilize, and potentially whether or not we should think about ASPs on a blended basis moving higher going forward in PCs? 
Steven Fieler: So on a full year basis, mix has definitely been a tailwind for us in Q4 specifically and, as you point out, on notebooks, but we did see an ASP decline. That's driven by FX. So that's a certain part of it. At the total print -- PS level, that's got 2 points, and then rate was 2 points. When we look at the rate specifically, and I touched on this in my prior comments, but the overall industry-wide pricing adjustments in the market due to the commodity cost dynamics in certain product categories like notebooks, pricing is also dependent upon the supply availability that you get. And so all that together is really what drove ASP down year-over-year in Q4. 
 In terms of upside potential, I'd say we view it as significant over time. And when we think about mix, the good news for HP is we're under-indexed in such favorable parts of the PC marketplace. You think about displays and accessories, you think about premium categories. In gaming, which we grew double digits this past quarter. You think about services. And so all of that, we view as more structural long-term tailwind for us. But in the near term, yes, we're facing so many dynamics, Intel being another one, as an example, and the overall supply that we get. So -- but when we think long term, a lot of potential upside on our mix as we can continue to drive these growth initiatives. 
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Okay. That's perfect. And as a follow-up, kind of that Intel comment. The CPU shortage situation has kind of persisted for much longer than what I think anybody would have expected. I'm just curious of how you guys have kind of thought about mitigating that impact in the portfolio. There are seemingly more competitive alternatives out there in the CPU market today. I'm just curious of how you see or what you think the explanation is for the CPU shortage. And whether or not there's other ways to potentially bridge the impact of revenue here, what seemingly looks like it's going to persist here, as you say, through the first half of 2020 at this point? 
Enrique Lores: So yes, you're right that we have been in this situation for about a year now. As I said before, we expect it to continue for probably at least 2 other quarters. I think the question about the why is probably a better question to ask to Intel than to us. What I can tell you, though, is that we continue to be committed to use multiple CPU providers. We are working with other vendors. We have been growing the mix of other categories. But Intel is still a very large part of our portfolio and, therefore, when there are shortages, we need to navigate through those and manage our business that way. 
Steven Fieler: And just 1 other mitigation factor. I'm kind of repeating my earlier comment, but it's important to reiterate, and that is we do expect a better mix of units, which should help mitigate the profit impact of this. While there may be revenue, less so on the bottom line. 
Enrique Lores: I think we are running out of time now. So I want to thank everyone for joining us today and taking the time to be here, and I'd like to emphasize the confidence that we have in our strategy and the multiple levers that we have to create value. We are -- we have been and we will be relentless in managing costs and investing to create long-term value. And we know how to manage through the current dynamics, which is what -- exactly what we have been doing during the last years. We will continue to execute our strategy with rigor, and we will keep our focus to drive long-term value creation for our shareholders. Thank you. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-08-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2019 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sean, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. 
 I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2019 third quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer; and Enrique Lores, HP's President of Imaging & Printing.

 And now I'll turn it over to Dion. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We have a lot to talk about today, and I want to start with the topic that I'm sure is most on your minds. 
 As you've seen, I will be stepping down as President and CEO of HP. This is a decision I made following a great deal of reflection, and it's among the hardest choices I've ever had to make. There is nothing more important to me than my family, and I'm making a personal decision to return to Australia to tend to a family health matter. 
 Serving as CEO of this great company for the past 4 years and having the opportunity to work alongside a truly incredible team has been the honor of my career. I also feel privileged that we have such an incredibly strong bench of capable leaders and robust succession planning at every level of the organization. The HP Board has had a rigorous succession planning process since day 1 of our company, and this process led the Board to exactly the right leader to usher in the next era of HP. After a thorough review and careful consideration of a full bench of external and internal candidates, I rest easy knowing that the company I love is in the best of hands with Enrique as the next CEO. 
 As you spend time with Enrique and get to know him as I have, you will see why he is uniquely positioned and exactly the right leader HP needs to build on the company's progress and capitalize on future opportunities. 
 Enrique began his career 30 years ago as an HP intern and spent decades becoming one of the company's most accomplished, multifaceted leaders. From his engineering roots and expertise across the Print, Personal Systems and service organizations to leadership roles at a country, region and worldwide level, Enrique is relentlessly dedicated to serving customers and partners and passionate about next-generation innovation. 
 Since I arrived at HP 7 years ago, I've seen what Enrique is made of. He combines the strategic acuity and operational rigor needed to be a great executive with the passion for people and deep sense of purpose needed to be a trusted leader.
 I personally benefited immensely from his leadership during the separation of Hewlett-Packard Company in 2015, when we spent many long days together setting HP on its current course. Enrique brought incredible vision to our separation management office and was a key architect of one of the largest and most complex corporate separations in business history. He then operationalized the strategy that transformed HP's cost structure while simplifying the organization and creating the capacity to invest in innovation and drive profitable growth. More recently, Enrique has led a comprehensive global review of HP strategy and business operations, working directly with our Board to define our future operating model and prioritize initiatives that maximize shareholder value. Just like at separation, he's bringing incredible vision and energy to this work and I know it will open exciting new doors for our company. 
 You will no doubt be spending a lot of time with Enrique, but I invited him to our call today to say a few brief words before we dig into our Q3 results. Enrique? 
Enrique Lores: Dion, let me start by thanking you for everything you have done for our company. I have worked for 9 CEOs during my career in HP, and you reflect the values of our founders and our company better than anyone. Your leadership has been a source of strength, and it has positioned HP well for the future. I'm grateful for all the time we have spent working together side by side, and I look forward for our continued partnership over the coming months. 
 I know I speak for everyone at HP when I say that we will always heed your advice to keep raising the bar. You will always be the first CEO of HP Inc. I also want to thank HP's Board of Directors for the confidence they have placed in me, and I would like to thank the extended HP team for their support and key contributions. 
 30 years ago, I was an engineering student in Spain. A group of HP engineers came to my school to share their passion for a printer. I have never seen anyone so passionate about a product and now are changing the world through innovation. It opened my eyes to new and wonderful possibilities. It taught me that imagination has no limit, and it inspired me to join this company. Today, I continue to be inspired by this company and our unique ability to bring out the best of humanity through the power of technology. Each day, our people across the company are constantly creating game-changing innovation that pushes the limits of human potential. Our opportunities to grow digital manufacturing and graphics printing redefine the model of computing and transform print [indiscernible]. This is the magic of HP, and it is why I'm so excited about our future.
 In separation, we have built on the foundational strength of HP, which include our powerful portfolio, operational excellence, rigorous cost management and purpose-driven culture. Yet as far as we have come, I believe we have great opportunities to do more and to continue our innovation journey. 
 An important part of our strategy is to focus on delivering short-term results and setting the company up for success in the long term. As part of the review I have been leading with the Board, we focused on growth but also in simplifying our operating model, evolving our business model and driving significant improvement in our cost structure. Our end objective is to create a more digitally-enabled, customer-centric organization. It's critical that we do so, because the needs of our customers are rapidly changing, and we must become a more agile organization that is trying to fully capitalize on the opportunities ahead. I have great confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable returns to our shareholders, and I can't wait to share my thinking and vision with you at our investor update in October.
 I would now like to turn the call back over to Dion and Steve to discuss the third quarter results. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Enrique. I'm truly proud of the work we've done to reinvent HP, and I have no doubt you'll be successful.
 Now let me turn to the quarter. We have a solid operating and financial foundation in place, which was on display once again in quarter 3. We delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58, up 12%, and we generated free cash flow of $2.2 billion while returning almost $800 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.
 And we've also raised the midpoint of our full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. Our positive performance demonstrates HP's strong foundation and ability to compete successfully in the global marketplace that continues to be shaped by opportunities and challenges, including macro and geopolitical uncertainties. These results also reflect the consistent focus on executing our strategy and our leadership in key markets. 
 We are still in the relatively early days of HP's reinvention, and you're going to see Enrique and the team taking actions to build on their progress. 
 Now let me provide more detail on our business group performance in quarter 3. It was an exceptional quarter for Personal Systems with revenue up 6% in constant currency and operating profit increasing 51%. We are achieving these results with incredible innovation across the Personal Systems portfolio anchored in a relentless focus on customer insights. We launched more than 40 innovations in the quarter. We also continue to invest in key priorities including new products, services and solutions. 
 In the Commercial business, we are meeting the needs of an increasingly mobile workforce. This quarter, we launched our latest EliteBook x360 lineup, which includes convertibles with up to 24 hours of battery life. More importantly, we continue to expand our security leadership position across our segments. This quarter, we rolled out HP Sure Sense across our latest EliteBooks and ZBooks, leveraging artificial intelligence to enable real-time malware protection. It's a similar innovation story in our Consumer business where we continue to set new benchmarks in design, performance and security. Our latest HP ENVY series features new stunning materials, our integrated privacy screen and the HP Webcam Kill Switch, which enables users to electrically turn off their webcams when not in use. No more Post-it Notes or stickers required. 
 And in gaming, our OMEN ecosystem continues to thrive. At gamescom this week we announced a new lineup of cutting edge displays and accessories as well as the expansion of OMEN Command Center software and services to enable players at all levels to enhance their competitiveness. 
 Across Personal Systems, we're driving an aggressive forward-looking agenda that's reinventing the way people work, live and play. And our products, supply chain and go-to-market are well positioned to capture ongoing demand and navigate industry dynamics.
 Turning to Print. Revenue was down 5% driven by Supplies. We once again outperformed the market in an increasingly challenging environment. HP continues to lead the Print category with a sharp focus on innovative products and services. In the contractual market, which includes A3, we continue making progress in leveraging our differentiated technology and IP to capture opportunities in the market. We achieved 10% A3 market share in calendar quarter 2. 
 From where we started, we have now reached critical mass in this important market segment. We continue to gain traction and scale, driven by the strategic decision we made to enter the A3 market and the smooth integration of Samsung Printing into our portfolio. More broadly, our contractual office business and consumer Instant Ink portfolio both again grew revenue double digits in the quarter. 
 In Graphics, we continue to see adoption of our technology as customers increasingly go digital. Our new HP Stitch portfolio is being positively received by customers, and we have had several key wins with our HP Indigo packaging process. We are also launching new products to address customer needs and adapt to the realities of today's marketplace. In Q3, we introduced HP Neverstop Laser, the first of its kind in the industry. Designed for small business owners in emerging markets, it features toner that can be reloaded in 15 seconds with capacity of up to 5,000 pages with a very competitive cost per copy. We also unveiled HP Smart Tank for home printing, which delivers best-in-class print quality and ink tank experience allowing for up to 38% faster printing compared with previous generations.
 Turning to Supplies. This category remains a work in progress particularly in EMEA. We have been aggressively addressing Supplies, and we are making progress relative to the strategic and operational initiatives we outlined on prior earnings calls. Strategically, we are growing our contractual businesses and adapting our business models. Operationally, among other actions, we have made and continue to make improvements in our business management systems, strengthen our pricing discipline, improve our channel partnerships and lower EMEA channel inventory levels in the Tier 1 and monitored Tier 2 ecosystem. 
 We are also making senior leadership changes in EMEA. We believe these are all important steps in the right direction, and there is still more work to do. We acknowledge that these changes are having a short-term impact on EMEA's results, both in terms of the immediacy and the extent of the impact in the second half of fiscal '19. In addition, we are also seeing increasing macroeconomic softness, particularly in EMEA where we saw the most significant revenue declines and industry-wide signs of market softness. This contributed to Q3 Supplies revenue being below our prior expectations. We are focused on doing the right things structurally and operationally for the business. But we need to do more. We are making significant changes in our cost structure and demonstrating market leadership with the scale to navigate a dynamic environment.
 Turning to our 3D Printing business. This quarter marked another set of important milestones. We opened the doors to 150,000-square-foot 3D Printing Center of Excellence in Barcelona. This is HP innovation at its best, bringing together the strength of HP's resources along with our partners and customers in what we believe is the largest and most advanced 3D printing and digital manufacturing R&D center in the world. 
 We also continue to drive installations with industrial grade customers and are seeing early traction for our Multi Jet Fusion 5200 solution. We are especially pleased to see customers embracing new data and software capabilities to achieve new levels of industrial manufacturing predictability, reliability, efficiency and quality. 
 Lastly, as we grow our business, we continue to do so in ways that serve the needs of our people, planet and communities. In Q3 we published our annual Sustainable Impact Report, documenting the progress we are making. These are not just the right things to do, they are the right things to do for our business. For example, our sustainable impact programs contributed to more than $900 million of new revenue in 2018, and that's a 35% increase versus the prior year. And we believe this will be a growing source of competitive advantage for HP in the years ahead. 
 To sum up, we continue to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow, reflecting the power of the broad portfolio we built and the ability of our teams to navigate market opportunities and challenges. We still have a lot of work ahead. We always will. I have enormous confidence in our business, our strategy and our team, including Enrique as our next CEO. You will see Enrique and the leadership team take actions to make significant changes in our cost structure, advance key strategic priorities and position HP for the future.
 Let me now pass the call over to Steve for more insight into this quarter's financial results. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Dion. Before I go through the results, I just want to thank you for your leadership of HP. I appreciate your partnership and you know that I won't be removing you from my speed dial just yet. And Enrique has already been on my speed dial for a long time, so that won't change. I look forward to a seamless transition in our partnership going forward. 
 Our third quarter performance reinforces HP's ability to deliver consistent company results, profitably grow and effectively manage our broad-based portfolio. In Q3, we grew operating profit dollars, generated strong cash flow and delivered double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. Our financial performance this quarter demonstrates our ability to successfully invest in our business while delivering strong financial results. We remain focused on pursuing returns-based opportunities ahead of us while also addressing challenges when we have them. This helps set up the company to deliver in the short term and generate long-term value creation. 
 Let's look at the details of the third quarter. Net revenue was $14.6 billion, flat year-on-year or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas and EMEA were flat, and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 19.9%, up 1.5 percentage points year-on-year, driven by disciplined execution and improved rate in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.8 billion, up 9%, driven by increased investments for both growth and efficiency including investments in innovation, targeted marketing spend as well as investments in HP's digital infrastructure. 
 Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $68 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.58, up $0.06 or 12% with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $23 million, acquisition-related credits of $12 million, restructuring and other charges of $14 million as well as nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million. It also excludes a net gain of $305 million for tax adjustments. This net gain is primarily driven by the net income tax gains resulting from several tax settlements across various jurisdictions, partially offset by the tax indemnification associated with these gains recorded in OI&E, which is part of the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise tax matters agreement. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.78. 
 At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are very pleased with our results. Revenue in the third quarter was $9.7 billion, up 3% or 6% in constant currency. By customer segment, we once again saw a divergence in performance, with Commercial revenue up 10% and Consumer revenue down 11%. By product category, revenue was up 8% for Desktop, up 4% for Workstations and flat for Notebooks. The team continued to successfully manage our overall product mix as Commercial demand remained strong while navigating some of the softer consumer markets. 
 Q3 operating margins grew very strong at 5.6%, up 1.7 points year-on-year. The exceptionally large increase was driven mainly by the team's continued focus on our strategy and disciplined execution in a favorable commodity cost environment. Operating profit was $547 million, up $185 million from the prior year. 
 In Print, the business outperformed a more difficult market. That being said, the results were mixed. We grew Commercial hardware revenue, increased our market share and continue to make progress in our contractual offerings. However, operating margins were down 0.4 points to 15.6% due to lower Supplies revenue. 
 Looking at the details. Q3 total Print revenue was $4.9 billion, down 5% nominally and in constant currency. Commercial hardware revenue was up 3%, and Consumer hardware revenue was down 10%. Total Hardware units were down 9% with Commercial units down 4% and Consumer units down 10%. In calendar quarter 2, HP gained market share to 44% as the overall market declined. Third quarter Supplies revenue was $3.2 billion, down 7% in constant currency with EMEA down in the mid-teens.
 Tier 1 channel inventory levels remained below the reduced ceilings. We are making progress on the operational and strategic plans described in prior quarters and remain confident we are taking the right action. However, with the increasing softness in the EMEA market, we expect Supplies revenue to remain weak in Q4 as we continue to make progress on our plan and thus, we expect Supplies revenue to decline approximately 4% to 5% for the full fiscal year. 
 Looking forward, we expect to take significantly more cost out of the business while also making more financial shifts in our business model across our combined hardware, services and Supplies profit pools. The combination of these operational, market and strategic factors means that we are not planning for Supplies revenue to grow in FY '20. Importantly, having said that, at our next investor update, we will share the multiple levers we have that give us confidence in growing non-GAAP EPS in FY '20.
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations and free cash flow were very strong at $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. In Q3, the cash conversion cycle was minus 36 days. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle improved 4 days, in line with normal seasonality with a 3-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding and a 1 day increase in days of inventory. We returned $533 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $240 million via cash dividends in Q3. Year-to-date, we have returned 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. 
 Looking forward to Q4, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook: We continue to expect a headwind from currency. In Personal Systems, we expect the pricing environment to be competitive; and in Print, we expect the market to remain soft in the fourth quarter; in addition, for the full, year we continue to expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection to be 16% in FY '19. Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: Q4 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59; Q4 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. We are raising our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.18 to $2.22. And full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.31 to $2.35.
 And we continue to expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full fiscal year.
 Operator, let's open the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Dion, I've really enjoyed watching you succeed as CEO. Sorry to see you go, but best wishes for both of you and your family. In terms of questions, the midpoint of fiscal fourth quarter EPS guidance is down a $0.01 versus the fiscal third quarter. If you look at the past 2 years, EPS expanded in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about some of the incremental headwinds that are driving the worst seasonality this year? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: Sure. I'll take that one, Katy. We've been steadily delivering all year on our EPS. And as you know, we did increase the full year outlook on the strength of Q3. I would describe Q4, we will remain prudent in balancing our current view of the risks and opportunities. 
 Maybe I'll just touch a little bit on what we're thinking and our outlook for Personal Systems and Print. So for Personal Systems, we'll still have a CPU-constrained environment across certain products. We're assuming that the incremental China tariffs on notebooks do not happen in Q4 according to the existing plan of record. But importantly for the guidance, we're expecting a dynamic and competitive pricing environment with some of the supply chain costs and benefits we had, had in Q3 softening as we enter into Q4. So in essence, the headwind we are seeing in FX offset by some of the supply chain tailwind that we've had from a cost perspective will steady out in Q4. 
 In Print, expect the overall print market to be soft. We'll continue to look for opportunities to place units. That being said, we do expect that the units could be impacted assuming the tariffs are impacted, which could mean we raised prices and could impact units, but less of an issue on operating profit dollars. We are expecting Supplies declines closer to our Q3 results in Q4, but we do expect to drive overall expense management. So when I take that all into account, it's sort of a prudent guide. With confidence, we can deliver within the range of $0.55 to $0.59. 
Kathryn Huberty: Printer Supplies as you've mentioned, down 7% was worse than you expected. You talked about some of the macro headwinds. But how did you perform in the inventory drawdown in EMEA? Your partner Canon suggested that the drawdown is now over and growth can improve in the back half of the year. Do you share that view? Or how much inventory depletion and investment to drive branded Supplies market share is still left to come into the model in the fourth quarter? 
Steven Fieler: So I said previously, the sizing of the overall inventory is a triangulation, given our lack of visibility into the entire channel ecosystem. But I'll start with some of the data to address your point, Katy, and then I'll provide some additional color. 
 So in EMEA, since Q1, we brought down our channel inventory dollars that we monitor, so this is both the Tier 1 and parts of the Tier 2 where we have visibility. The total channel inventory dollar reduction is nearly the $100 million that we initially estimated. So we have made good progress. However, it's not possible to specifically quantify what impact we've made in the rest of the unmonitored downstream ecosystem. 
 In addition, we do know that we've been reducing channel inventory dollars at the same time the EMEA market is softening, which is the right thing to do and important business discipline. It does make it more difficult to distinguish the market factors versus operational factors. It's important that we continue to maintain our Tier 1 channel inventory under the reduced ceilings globally, which we are, and we're also improving the monitoring of our Tier 2. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: Dion, I want to echo Katy comments. We've enjoyed working with you and we want -- hope for the best for your family. My first question, it's just -- if we can understand a bit more about what's going on in Printing, and I don't know if Enrique is still around, but I'd be curious as to how much of this seems to be a secular shift, and then we started to hear a lot more concern out of the Japanese in the most recent quarter, that they reported relative to some of their prior commentary, not just Canon but others. So I'm curious if there's something really changing here or if you think it's more again the macro pressures. And then I have a follow-up. 
Enrique Lores: So Shannon, thank you for the question. Let me talk first about Supplies and then I will give you an overall view of the print market. On the Supplies space as we discussed in Q1, we see 2 different type of issues, some more operational, some more strategic. The strategic issues presumably will have a longer term impact, and we see will be impacting us not only this year but also the years to come. And this has, though that some of our competitors have also been highlighting. During the last year, we have created a very attractive profit pool of supply but now has attracted many other companies to try to attack it, and capture a portion of it without having to have a significant investment that are necessary to create the hardware installed base. And because of that, we see an erosion of the overall profit pool that, according to our model, means a reduction in share and a reduction in price. We are experiencing that, and many of our own competitors have experience in similar dynamics. 
 On top of that, during the last quarter we have seen a slowdown in -- we have seen an economic slowdown, and this is also having an impact, especially in the Consumer side. When -- so when we look at the combination of all the factors I described, you can understand many of the comments that many of the other companies in the industry have been making during the last quarter. 
Shannon Cross: And maybe I don't know if you want to take my follow-up question, but I'm curious as -- and I know, I'm not trying to front run what you're going to say at the Analyst Day, but as you look at some of the top line pressures that you're facing and the fact that PCs are going to go, probably will be under pressure next year or following the end of life for 1 7, and the 1 10 refresh, how does that impact your thoughts on investment in some of the other areas that the company is looking at, like 3D Printing and the A3 market? Will that shift any of, of where the spend is going? 
Steven Fieler: I'll maybe address that first, and then Enrique, if you want to chime in, Shannon. So I think the reality is, that we expect to continue to do both. It's about investments in innovation and also productivity and efficiency. And as you heard in our prepared remarks from both Dion, Enrique and myself, we do think that there's an opportunity to take significant cost out of the business while maintaining our investments for growth. 
 I mean just to give you a little bit of context, as you all see in our P&L, but we've got over $50 billion of annual spend. So we've got a rather large addressable spend opportunity to go after across cost of goods in OpEx, so really every percentage point here really matters. And so you'll be hearing more about the opportunities we see in the month ahead at the Investor Day, but overall, we can sort of align our cost activities with our growth and investing activities. 
Enrique Lores: I think Shannon, you will see that our line going forward is going to be aligned around 3 different complementary directions: First, we need to continue to expand into some of the growth opportunities that we had identified in the past, 3D Printing, contractual businesses are all opportunities for us to grow; at the same time, we need to continue evolving our business model. I highlighted that already last year during the Investor Day, and we will share some of the progress and the plans that we've had to double down in this space; and third, we have a great opportunity to create value by continuing to simplify our company, get close to customers -- getting closer to customers and also reduce our cost structure. Because this reduction in cost structure will give us also the opportunity and the capacity to continue to invest in the growth area. 
Dion Weisler: Just to round that out, I'd just finally say that, that's what gives all of us, myself, Steve and Enrique, the confidence of these multiple levers that we see and gives us that confidence in our ability to grow EPS again next year. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: And let me reiterate previous comments. Dion, I wish you all the best and for your family going forward. And Enrique, look forward to working with you more closely. 
 I just wanted to follow up on the Printing. So it sounds like things have gotten notably worse in the last couple of months because, as you noted, your guidance originally was Supplies to be down 3%, and you were tracking to that through the first half of the year, and now you're suggesting it's going to be down 4% or 5%, which would suggest that the second half is going to be down 6% or 7%, which is dramatically worse than you had thought. And I think initially your thought, through tactical improvement, things might actually get a little progressively better over the course of the year. 
 And so if I just reflect on the magnitude of that change in outlook, are you really suggesting that most of this is a bigger strategic headwind from cloning and alternatives than you had originally thought? Or are you suggesting that the economic weakness in Europe is the principal driver? Because I guess my observation would be, globally, the economy is still pretty healthy. And so if we're seeing with relatively healthy global economy, normalized Supplies growth is minus 6% or minus 7%, that's pretty rough to me. So perhaps you could clarify that, and I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler: Let me provide some financial context and hand over to Dion for additional color. So in the first half, our total Supplies revenue was down 3%. EMEA was down roughly 9% in the same period. And in Q3, total Supplies was down 7% with EMEA down mid-teens. I say that because I want to be very clear that our Supplies performance continues to be driven by EMEA. 
Dion Weisler: Yes, and let me try to add a little bit of context here. There's 2 primary factors here that are occurring simultaneously. The first one is as we look across the macroeconomic environment, particularly in EMEA, we are seeing even more uncertainty in industry-wide market softness. And secondly, as I described in my prepared remarks, we're making progress in the plans we outlined on the prior earnings calls, and taking the appropriate structural and operational actions including marketing and our brand protection, business management systems as well as our deal pricing discipline that we talked about in the past, just to name a few. 
 In addition, we're making senior management changes in EMEA, and all of these are designed to put our EMEA Print business on a stronger footing. And while we had expected that these changes would create a short-term impact in the channel, we underestimated the immediacy, the reaction and the size of the impact on the back half of the year. And it's the combination of these 2 factors that have the larger-than-anticipated decline in EMEA. But as Steve mentioned in these prepared remarks, we are confident that in spite of all of this, we can navigate through these challenges and hit our senior metrics of EPS and free cash flow. And finally, we're confident in the multiple levers that we see and that again gives us confidence in our ability to grow EPS again next year. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Just to change topics. As you noted, the PC margins were exceptionally strong this quarter. And Steve, it sounded like your guidance for Q4 and your description of a more competitive PC environment was suggesting that margins may not be as strong. But how do we think about normalized PC margins? I think you had at one point said 3% to 5%, and then sort of lowered that to 3% to 4%. What do you think is normalized? And how quickly do you feel that the following component prices will ultimately be passed along to end customers? 
Steven Fieler: So we do view Q3 as an exceptional quarter for us, growing operating profit dollars $185 million in Personal Systems alone. And I do want to give kudos to the team, they stuck with the strategy. They've remained disciplined all year with the year-to-date performance of 4.7% up margins and over $300 million profit drop in that segment alone. But to directly address your question: We do expect margins to normalize back, I would say into the 3% to 5% range, Toni. Our goal of approaching the higher end of that over time. There will always be more shorter-term headwinds and tailwinds, whether it be commodity cost, FX, other pricing dynamics that tend to move pretty rapidly. What we're focused on is the longer term shift of our mix and improvement of our portfolio across our products and services, and this is a stickier, more structural margin improvement that we expect to get over time, again with the goal of getting to the higher end of that 3% to 5% over the years ahead. 
Dion Weisler: And I think, Toni, you've seen the team very consistently over multiple years deliver against that strategy and that's what you can expect from us in the future. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. 
Amit Daryanani: Dion, best wishes to you and your family in the future. I guess 2 questions for me as well. Given the Supplies discussion we've had so far, versus what you guys thought 90 days ago, how much of the shortfall is the macro getting worse versus execution issues? Is there a way to split those 2 buckets up? And then Dion or Enrique, I'd love to hear your conviction and confidence on why you think this issue's not spread beyond EMEA to North America or APJ as well? 
Steven Fieler: So on the first part of it, it's really hard to bifurcate the data between what the 2 actions -- the 2 items that Dion described, sort of the actions we're taking in the market and how that's changed. What I will highlight, I think it's important to highlight is, if you just reflect on the first half of the year in Print, our Supplies were down 3%, and we grew operating profit dollars in that period. And I do want to acknowledge we do not grow OP dollars in Print in Q3, given the larger Supplies decline, but we do have multiple levers across our Print business from more profitability on our hardware services, more growth in our growth initiatives as well as cost structure items to address in Print. So there are other levers beyond Supplies. 
Dion Weisler: Yes, I'll also chime in here and I'll ask Enrique to give us his thoughts, but as I discussed in quarter 2, we continue to make progress on the action plans that I laid out in February, our Supplies task force is really taking the appropriate and very decisive steps in EMEA to put our Supplies business in better fighting shape in light of the industry-wide and macro headwinds that we're seeing. We expected an impact from these actions that the size and the timing of the ripples caused in the back half of this year is something that we underestimate. And I'm sure Enrique can give you sort of a little more color on our progress there as well. 
Enrique Lores: Okay. So let me cover some of the operational improvements that we have made. As I've had, had -- as we have learned in Q1, the nature of the [indiscernible] operating side growth on operational and a strategic side. On the operational side, we aligned 4 areas of progress, so let me share some of them. We say that we needed to increase our investment in demand generation in the online side. We have done that and we have seen the progress. For example, in most of the key European markets, we have seen a 10-point improvement in coverage when customers look for us, for Supplies in Google. We have also doubled down in our brand protection activity, both increasing our efforts to fight counterfeit, but also in protecting our IP. And protecting our IP is something we have done by ourselves, but also you have seen Canon taking very decisive actions in their side of the portfolio, where they own the IP. We have also continued to improve the visibility that we've had in the Tier 2 space. And just in Europe, we have increased the number of reporting partners by 50%. 
 And as Dion said, in Q1, we have also improved our business management system. We have centralized pricing decisions, and we have changed and improved the controls around our discount policy, again to make sure that we manage the business more effectively. As you can see, these has all grown very broad on these actions, but it will take some time until we see the full effect of all of those. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: And again, Dion, I'll echo the sentiments of everybody on the call. It's been great working with you, thought you did just a really fantastic job with the company and wish you and your family all the best in the future. So yes, good luck. 
 Two if I could. I guess just sticking with Supplies and one on PCs. Any sense of how long you think, I guess, getting sort of call it critical mass with some of the structural channel dynamics in Europe, I would say. Because it sounds like you have some sense of what's going on since you've adjusted the guidance here. And I know you're going to give updated guidance at the Analyst Day, but it would be helpful if you could get some sense of how many quarters we are, how many months we are, when you guys kind of get into structural, critical mass. And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: So maybe I'll take that one first. And as I said in my prepared remarks, and I think Enrique went into long detail about FY '20 and the strategic and operational things, so I would bifurcate the 2. 
 So in the operational side, where we're driving in EMEA, we are making good progress. And yes, the timing extent and sort of the immediacy of the impact was harder than we anticipated, but we are making good progress and would expect to work through these operational changes in relatively short order in the quarters to come. As it relates to the more strategic impact, that's the more sustainable impact for us, and it's really the primary driver of why we don't expect Supplies to grow in FY '20. 
 That being said, as I commented previously, we have multiple levers. We've demonstrated this with the first half of the year, growing operating profit dollars even with our Supplies business declining. We've got levers around the growth initiatives that we're driving, we got levers around the business model itself, the shift to contractual, the shift to more profit in hardware and services itself. And we've got levers around our cost structure and significant cost saving opportunities. And these things holistically is why we have confidence in our EPS plans for next year to grow. We've been working on this plan as a team. Enrique, Dion, myself and the leadership team, and we're all confident in our ability to grow EPS next year. 
Enrique Lores: Actually, it is easier to answer. The strategic problem on the supply side would be, we are addressing by business model changes. The acceleration of our Printing as a service business is critical there. You have seen us introducing printers with a different business model, both on the ink side and in the laser side. And actually, we are leading now many of these markets. And also, we will be looking at our cost structure, we will continue to reduce our cost structure to make sure that we deliver on the EPS goals that Steve was mentioning before. 
Steven Fieler: We look forward to laying all these plans out with you at the investor meeting. 
Ananda Baruah: And guys, is it possible to return to growth at any quarter in fiscal year '20? 
Steven Fieler: I'm assuming that question was in relation to Supplies. And I don't think we want to give any comment specifically on any particular quarter. Again, I think we're looking at our portfolio holistically, about the ability to drive the company results, both earnings per share and cash flow. I do want to also highlight, we have a strong Personal Systems business that represented 42% of our operating profit in Q3, so we have multiple levers at our company to grow our earnings per share. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. 
Timothy Long: Just 2 if I could. First, can you just give us a little color on the Personal Systems side? Consumers' been tough the last few quarters. Could you just give us a little insight into what it's going to take to get that segment going again? And then second, on that A3 side, you mentioned getting a 10%, getting some scale there. What does that scale mean? When do -- when will we start seeing some more Supplies pull through? What does that scale gain you when it comes to the financial model? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So we look at our Personal Systems results, and actually, our company results, we did see a softer Consumer similar to what we saw last quarter and a stronger Commercial. I think when we look at the results, we are seeing softer Consumer across the board with a stronger Commercial. Some of that is driven on the Personal Systems side by the supply and availability of supply we're getting and demand shaping as appropriate. 
 It's important that you all understand we've got a very diversified portfolio across Consumer and Commercial. Even Commercial is SMB enterprise, and we're selling to the industrial space. So given the diversity of the geographies we play in and the product portfolio that we have, the customer segments that we play in, we feel like we can manage through up and down environments. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. As it relates to the second question, we've said all along it will be very strategic and systematic in how we go after this $50 billion-plus A3 market. I've also said on many occasions that customers don't think about their printing in the context of A3 or A4. In fact, many don't even know the difference. They think about their overall Printing solutions. And I realize that we set a 12% share target by the end of 2020, but our overall focus has always been on building a contractual business, and A3 is a key element of that strategy. It's also been important that we validate our technology and achieve critical mass in a competitive field, and we're doing just that. We achieved double-digit market share at 10%, and we expanded our OEM partnership that we announced earlier in Q3 with Xerox, which further validates the strength of our strategy and the product portfolio. 
 So I'm really not fixated on getting to 12% share by any particular period. And I'm not saying that we will or we won't, but what is important is we build the right distribution and partners to penetrate the contractual office. So from a customer's perspective, which is what guides us, what I can say is in the overall Printing solution is what matters most and when you combine our A3 products, our technology, our channel and our overall capabilities, and we couple that with our market-leading A4 presence, we really have a very compelling and formidable portfolio. So remember our larger strategy is to grow in contractual and to evolve our business model into more services and solutions. 
Operator: Our next question will come from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. 
Kanghui Ong: So Print margins have degraded to kind of the lowest point in at least a couple of years. I think asking -- focusing on Printing a different way, is there a scenario where Print margins maintain even if Supplies revenues decline? And what would be the growth drivers in other businesses perhaps, to get the margins to stabilize? 
Steven Fieler: I think it's important that, to communicate our focus is on operating profit dollars. It always has been, it's OP dollars and not related to any particular quarter. As I alluded to earlier, we have different levers, not just applied, to drive our profit dollars. 
 As it relates to the rate specifically, we did deliver a 15.6% op margin in Q3. It is below our target, at least 16%. I would expect Q4 margins to remain weaker, given my Supplies commentary. I'm -- probably more in the range of our Q3 margins as we work through the EMEA Supplies challenges and overall Print market weakness. That being said, in the near term, our annual op margin target remains at, at least 16%. But to reiterate, our focus is on OP dollars, and opportunities to drive even more operating profit dollars outside of Supplies with the items I talked about earlier today. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, additionally I'll add that at the company level, we're really proud of how we manage our total portfolio and we continue to deliver consistently against our senior metrics of earnings per share and free cash flow, the commitments that we make. I think you should draw great comfort from this and that this highly experienced team knows how to operate in both up and down markets and how to respond positively to the inevitable business challenges that are just part of business. 
Kanghui Ong: Got it, appreciate that. I've got another one but I'll flip over to the PC side. There's about 130 basis point improvement quarter-on-quarter in margins. So it seems like while some of your peers might have seen better margins in their PC businesses a quarter earlier probably due to memory components, it seems you're predominantly seeing the memory prices better in the latest quarter. 
 I guess is there any way that you guys have thought about breaking down how much of this quarter-on-quarter increase in margins was due to components versus perhaps better mix or more Consumer versus -- or better mix or more Commercial versus Consumer, I'm sorry. And any way you can break that down for us? 
Steven Fieler: Well, what I'd say it's all of the above. I mean we continue to make progress. The team has been very disciplined with their pricing strategy. But our also -- our overall Personal Systems mix on a year-over-year basis continues to improve. I don't think -- if I'm going to break it down specifically, but is, to the earlier question, was from Toni, our operating margin rate target is between 3% to 5%. And over time, our plans are to drive to the upper end of that rate. 
Dion Weisler: So unfortunately we're out of time, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I also want to extend a personal thank you to all of you for your warm wishes and for your personal support over the years. It's been an honor working with you. We obviously had a lot to talk about today. 4 years ago, many people doubted this business. We didn't. We reinvigorated this business and reinvented HP. The team's executing against our strategy and investing in innovation while simultaneously taking cost out of the business, and we always have to do both. 
 As a result, we've delivered consistent free cash flow and met or exceeded our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the last 15 out of 15 quarters. I like that batting average. Enrique, you need to continue that. We have a strong foundation, a really strong foundation, a powerful portfolio. We have world-class talent. We have a culture of performance. It's been an honor to serve as CEO of this iconic company. Enrique's been a tremendous partner to me as we reinvented HP, and I couldn't be more excited and optimistic for him and for the future of HP under his leadership. I'm 100% focused on finishing our Q4 and the fiscal year and to ensuring a smooth transition at the company that I love and then to look forward to continue to guide the company as a director moving forward. Thank you very much. 
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-05-23 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2019 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is William, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. 
 And now I'd now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

 And now I'll turn it over to Dion. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q2, as you can see from our results, we are delivering on our plans, demonstrating strong execution and progress on our priorities. Our strategy remains consistent: to engineer experiences that amaze while driving profitable growth. We are striking the right balance between driving results for today and investing for the long term. We're leading in our core PC and print markets while extending our portfolio of services and solutions in our growth and future categories. 
 In the second quarter, revenue was $14 billion, up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.53, up 10% and at the high end of our outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $747 million, and we returned $936 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends. 
 We continue to operate in a dynamic environment that includes ongoing industry component and strength as well as macroeconomic, geopolitical and tariff uncertainties. But we have a highly experienced team that know how to navigate through complex market conditions. Despite industry-wide issues, we will stay laser-focused on our strategy to drive long-term, sustainable performance, build trust in our brand and create shareholder value. 
 Let me provide a few highlights and color on each of our businesses. We continue to execute well in Personal Systems. Revenue grew 5% in constant currency with strong operating margins of 4.3%. Innovation and design are setting our product mix apart, and we're making disciplined investments in solutions and demand generation. We continue to drive profitable growth through a relentless focus on customer insights and by aggressively pursuing targeted opportunities to go after the heat in the market. While PC growth across the industry was more subdued this quarter, HP continued to outperform the market and gain profitable share. 
 Our Commercial portfolio remains strong, with growth in both commercial desktops and notebooks. As IT decision-makers look to create the office of the future, they are turning to HP to support their requirements for both manageability and security. For small and medium-sized businesses, we expanded our AMD portfolio with the launch of HP ProBooks, incorporating premium design and versatility. We also expanded on our premium offerings with the new Intel-based EliteBook 800, bringing robust security to mainstream business users. This includes HP Sure Sense, our new software that harnesses AI to detect and prevent malware threats. 
 We also continued to raise the bar for gamers with new OMEN devices, software, displays and accessories. As any gamer will tell you, gaming is all about immersion, experience and competition. We are growing our ecosystem and setting new benchmarks for e-sports, including last week's launch of the OMEN X 2S, the world's first dual-screen gaming laptop. What makes this system special is that it enables multitasking for gamers to message, watch a Twitch stream or run other apps without ever having to take their eyes off the game. 
 While we're growing our core, we're continuing to gain momentum in strategic growth areas, including Device as a Service and retail solutions. This quarter, we announced HP DaaS Proactive Security, a significant extension to HP's award-winning DaaS solution, providing the world's most advanced Windows 10 security service for files and browsing. And in our retail solutions business, HP Engage, our retail point-of-sale solution, was selected to power roughly 2,000 stores for one of the world's largest office product retailers. 
 Shifting to Printing, we again outperformed the market in a challenging environment. Total revenue declined 2%, and as expected, Supplies declined 3%. In Supplies, we are taking decisive action. We have made and continued to make improvements in our business management systems and to enhance our measurements of the market and our performance. We are simplifying and strengthening our pricing discipline to achieve consistency of our value proposition. Also in Q2, we increased both our brand protection activities and our online marketing with a focus on search and demand generation. Finally, growing our contractual businesses and evolving our business models remain key strategic initiatives. 
 In hardware, revenue growth in Commercial was offset by weaker consumer demand. Not all hardware is created equal, and we are focused on shifting the installed base to more productive and profitable units. In Q2, we saw Commercial revenue growth in A3 and A4 enterprise. We also introduced a new generation of OfficeJet Pro products and reimagined the print experience for the way small and medium-size businesses and employees are printing. Our design team connected with thousands of small business owners across the globe to create a product that meets their unique needs. Built with sustainability in mind, it incorporates best-in-class security and a new smart task workflow solution into a printer that is 39% smaller than the previous generation. This was the insight required to fit into today's smaller and more versatile workspaces. 
 Turning towards the contractual marketing, including A3, we continue to make progress and are leveraging our differentiated technology and IP to capture opportunities. In Q2, we won several large Managed Print Service contracts, including a multimillion-dollar deal with Petrobras to provide a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and services, including our A3, DesignJet and PageWide products. And in graphics printing, we extended the business into a natural adjacency, opening an entirely new market for us with the launch of the HP Stitch portfolio. These digital textile printers are specifically designed for sportswear, interior decor and soft signage applications. HP Stitch builds on HP's leadership in inkjet technology with precise color matching and cost-efficient, streamlined production capabilities. 
 Turning to 3D Printing. This month, we expanded our portfolio with the introduction of our most advanced Multi Jet Fusion systems to date, the Jet Fusion 5200. By bringing together innovations in systems, data intelligence, software and material science, we are able to deliver new levels of manufacturing predictability and applications potential. And we are excited that companies like Jaguar Land Rover are early users of this new system. Of course, transformation of large manufacturing industries doesn't happen in isolation. Our customers are looking for complete solutions that integrate into their long-term manufacturing road maps and existing processes. This month, we announced industrial alliances with Siemens and BASF. We will deliver an end-to-end digital manufacturing solution that integrates HP's 3D Printing portfolio with Siemens' digital industry's offering from 3D design to simulation, production, factory planning and analytics. Together, we will be working with automotive and industrial companies to transform their manufacturing with existing customers, including Volkswagen. 
 Finally, I want to spend a moment on an exciting announcement we made just this week. HP and SmileDirectClub, the leader in teledentistry, announced a milestone partnership to reinvent the orthodontics industry. To keep up with demand and accelerate their growth, SmileDirectClub will be deploying a fleet of 49 HP 3D Printing systems to produce more than 50,000 unique molds per day, one of the largest 3D printing projects in the United States. This is truly industrial-scale 3D production. Together, these are all significant steps for our 3D Printing business. Our expanded portfolio, materials and industrial alliances enable us to serve a growing range of customers with a diverse range of manufacturing needs. We are well positioned within the digital manufacturing industry and are helping to ignite the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 
 Overall, I'm pleased with our Q2 results. We remain focused on driving great innovation, disciplined execution and prudent cost management. We remain agile and adaptable in the face of volatility in an ever-changing landscape. We will continue to execute today while we invest in our growth and future businesses. 
 With that context, I'm going to turn it over to Steve for a closer look at the numbers. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Dion. In Q2, we demonstrated resilience and overall delivered a solid quarter. We grew revenue in constant currency. We grew operating profit dollars, and non-GAAP EPS grew double digits. We see opportunities ahead as well as ongoing uncertainties and remain focused on executing our long-term strategy as we navigate in a dynamic environment. 
 In the second quarter, net revenue was $14 billion, flat or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 1%, EMEA was up 2%, and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 19.4%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margin was up 1.6 percentage points, in line with normal seasonality, driven by both rate and mix improvement. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.7 billion, up 1%, driven by an increase in SG&A. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $60 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.53, up $0.05 or 10% with a diluted share count of approximately 1.5 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $29 million, acquisition-related charges of $11 million, restructuring and other charges of $69 million, nonoperating retirement-related credits of $10 million, tax adjustments resulting in a benefit of $43 million, and a tax-related impact on all of these items. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.51. 
 At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are executing well and delivering a consistent, profitable growth. I am pleased with the team's ability to remain focused on our long-term strategy while navigating each quarter in a highly dynamic market environment. Total Personal Systems revenue in the second quarter was $8.9 billion, up 2% and up 5% in constant currency. Operating margins improved 50 basis points to 4.3%, driven by improved mix, which we view as more structural as well as better rates, largely a result of supply chain cost favorability, partially offset by unfavorable currency. Our Q2 results reflect our ability to manage through a constrained CPU environment, segment our markets, identify areas of profitable growth and make trade-offs as appropriate. By customer segment, Commercial revenue was up 7%. Consumer revenue declined 9%, driven by overall market softness. By product category, revenue was up 7% for Desktops, up 6% for Workstations and down 1% for Notebooks. Overall, in calendar quarter 1, our market share was 23.2%, up 0.5 point year-over-year, and demand for our products remain strong. 
 Turning to Printing. Our reinvention journey continues as we outperform our respective markets, continue to target growth opportunities and make progress addressing challenges in our core. Revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, down 2% year-over-year nominally and in constant currency. Commercial hardware revenue growth was more than offset by declines in Consumer hardware and Supplies. Hardware units were down 4%, with Consumer and Commercial categories down 4% and 3%, respectively. Having said that, we outperformed the market, gaining share in the calendar first quarter in both our home and office businesses and in key segments, including A3. We continue to make progress in our contractual offering. This includes strong growth in Instant Ink, where we're growing revenue in our global subscriber base, and in MPS, where we continue to grow revenue as well. 
 In Q2, Supplies revenue was down 3% nominally and in constant currency. We continue to operate below our Tier 1 channel inventory ceiling. As Dion just described, we are taking several actions in this business. As part of our business management system, we are implementing programs to enhance our visibility in the downstream channel. We have made initial progress lowering Tier 1 channel inventory, but there's still more progress to be made over the next 2 quarters, particularly in Tier 2 in the downstream ecosystem. We still anticipate Supplies revenue will decline approximately 3% in constant currency for the full year. In print, operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 16.4%, driven by spend favorability as we balance tight expense management with continued strategic investments in key growth initiatives, including 3D. 
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q2 cash flow from operations was $861 million, and free cash flow was $747 million. In Q2, the cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days. Sequentially, the cash conversion cycle weakened 3 days. The change was primarily driven by a 4-day increase in accounts receivables, which was impacted by revenue linearity. We saw a 1-day increase of days of inventory and a 2-day increase in accounts payable. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. This included $691 million for share repurchases and $245 million via cash dividends. For the full year, we still expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. 
 Looking forward to the second half of FY '19. Keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook: We expect an increased headwind from currency. We have incorporated the impacts from tariffs currently in place, including the increase from 10% to 25% implemented earlier this month, but we have not included the impact for any future tariffs. In Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints to continue through the third calendar quarter. Also, as I have said before, we remain committed to driving productivity and investing for growth at the same time. Effective cost management remains a critical element of our success in very competitive markets. And we'll continue looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '19. 
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: Q3 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.56; Q3 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.52. We are updating our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.21, and full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.04 to $2.11. 
 So now let's open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. 
Jim Suva: And I'll ask both my questions at the same time, and you can do them in any order. And they're pretty simple. While you updated your EPS guidance, I don't believe in the slides or your prepared comments you mentioned free cash flow changes. Just help us bridge that. And then more importantly, now that we've driven past the hiccups of the 4-box model and the ink supplies that you've had challenges with, can you give us a backward looking -- as we progress through that, what exactly, looking back, happened? What you've learned? And have fully overcome those speed bumps? And how should we think about the 4-box model? Like did you have to put in a couple of variable -- new variables or adjustments now that it looks like you've made progress? How should we think about what you've learned from that as we all learned in life all the time? 
Steven Fieler: Jim, let me address the free cash flow question first. So we have not always updated our free cash flow guide on particular earnings calls, but I will confirm that we are still expecting to achieve $3.7 billion or greater for the full year in cash flow. And the assumptions are pretty straightforward similar to prior quarters. First of all, just to remind everyone, we do expect over time that free cash flow to grow in line with earnings, and we're taking into account our earnings for the year, our cash conversion cycle and volume. And when I look at first half of the year, we did deliver $1.4 billion of free cash flow and that would leave $2.3 billion in the back half of this year. We actually achieved $2.3 billion in FY '18 and $2.2 billion in FY '17. 
 So this is very consistent to where we've been in prior years. And really, the assumption is around I would expect that there would be some upside favorability to the cash conversion cycle, which ends at minus 32 days in Q2, and also that we would expect to see the normal Personal Systems volume in the second half, which is higher than the first half. So that's on the free cash flow. Dion, do you want to comment on where we're on Supplies? I can add to it if you need. 
Dion Weisler: Yes, absolutely. And Jim, thanks for the question. I can assure you that we are all over this, as you can imagine. We're taking very decisive actions on the plans that we outlined last quarter. I think we were very detailed in how we thought about last quarter and how we explained really 6 themes, 4 operational themes and 2 strategic initiatives that we needed to drive. Since then, I've put a Supplies task force as well as a global program office in place with a primary focus on EMEA and then to ensure consistency across all of the regions. We've identified and began implementing several changes already. I'll walk you through where we are on the 4 operational issues and the 2 strategic areas, the focus that I outlined on quarter 1 and then I'll have Steve chime in as well. 
 So first, let me start with the operational actions. We're making changes in our marketing and go-to-market to address our supply share and you'll recall that was really where we primarily deviated from a 4-box model last quarter. We've increased our investment in search significantly versus last year in all regions. And we've improved our search coverage in the main markets within EMEA. We've also changed our marketing mix with key online marketplaces to improve the prioritization of HP original supplies. Secondly, we're upping our game in terms of brand protection. We're going to defend our brand as well as our intellectual properties to ensure that our customers receive the quality, the benefits, the sustainability and environmental advantages that original HP Supplies provide. 
 Thirdly, we're working with our Tier 2 channel partners to gain more visibility into the overall the overall Tier 2 channel inventory and to reduce the overall level of inventory. And fourthly, we're bolstering our business management systems. For example, we're improving our pricing discipline, and we are continuing to enhance our data management. We're leveraging the big data on the telemetry information that we're now collecting, and we're doing that across the installed base of printers that we outlined in Q1 to provide more accurate and timely reporting and insight.
 Regarding the 2 strategic areas of focus. Firstly, as we actually discussed at SAM and on prior calls, we're evolving in print to focus on driving growth in our contractual business, certainly where our customers are really interested in transacting with us through those contractual motions. And then finally, we're adopting new business models to continue to drive long-term value in print. And Steve, with that, it's probably a good idea to provide some additional color on the progress in channel inventory and in other areas. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. Maybe -- I guess I'll add to that. And Jim, just to kind of remind us that what we identified in Q1 kind of relative to the assumptions we had in our model, where we had inaccurate assumptions were primarily around share, I think, which Dion just addressed in his remarks; and then to a lesser extent, pricing. And so there are a lot of, let's call them, sort of forecast changes we're making to better analyze share from the telemetry that Dion mentioned, also online and other customer analytics. And then from a channel inventory perspective, we are making good progress bringing on the channel inventory, as we mentioned on the last call. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: We've spoke with companies that aren't even halfway through their required refresher upgrade to Windows 10. And so how significant could the commercial PC demand be in the back half of the year? And should we think about that as a more protected IT project versus some of the areas where we're hearing about pushouts? Then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So I won't make any specific kind of revenue guide counter, but I will say in general that what we're seeing in the market -- and I think it's generally in line with what the industry analysts are saying as well is that we have a more favorable Commercial market and a softer Consumer one. And we have seen strength in Commercial and are expecting a bit of a tailwind and lift from the Win 10 refresh in the second half of the year and even directionally beyond this year. The Win 10 migration has been executed, let's call it, I guess, a bit more smoothly than the prior rollover period. So do not expect a significant trough in 2020. So it is a driver of some of the Commercial demand we're seeing. 
Kathryn Huberty: And Steve, I assume that, that also plays into the confidence around the cash conversion cycle? 
Steven Fieler: It does. I mean the -- again, a big assumption is, you can call it normal seasonality with better second half, and Personal Systems will be higher than the first half. And that is driven by some strength we see in Commercial, which is partially offset by some of the Consumer softness. 
Dion Weisler: And what I've been really impressed with, Katy, is being this relentless focus on customer insight and turning that insight into innovation. I think the Personal Systems team and Alex and together with the regions have really listened to our customers. The -- we continue to launch incredible products. We know there is an incredible area of concern around cyber, and it's front and center within the portfolio. And as a result of that, we're seeing really strong demand for our products, particularly in the Commercial space. 
Kathryn Huberty: And then what is the impact from tariffs that you've baked into the full year guide? And what mitigating actions are you taking around the manufacturing footprint and any new pass-through pricing? 
Dion Weisler: It's a great question, Katy, and if you're watching CNBC today, you would have seen that they were asking that question relentlessly. So let me kind of bifurcate my answer on tariffs into 2 portions. The first is the current tariffs that we know about. Our guidance includes the impact of the tariffs that are currently in place, including the increase from 10% to 25% that went into effect earlier this month. So here, I'm referring to that roughly $200 billion trade tariff list. 
 Regarding the new list that was published earlier this month, clearly, it's an industry-wide situation in the U.S. that has continued to be very dynamic, and so we don't speculate or comment on potential impacts until we know all the facts. And we're still hopeful an agreement will be reached. And the reason I say that is because it's really highly uncertain. First of all, we don't know if the additional tariffs will happen at all. Secondly, if they do happen, we don't know when that would be -- when that would happen, and the timing on that really does make a big difference. And thirdly, we don't know what the final list of products will be, what will be included, what may be excluded. And finally, we don't know how much or what the tariff rates would be. 
 So I know that's quite a few variables, and all of those variables can change the calculus quite significantly. And we've seen that in the past as we've worked through the first $200 billion list of tariffs. We've seen those variables in play. There have been multiple phases. They've been products that have been on the list and excluded from the list, and there have been changes to the tariff rates over time. So we continue to assess the potential impact to the business, and we're very active. We are not sitting idly by. We're looking at multiple scenarios. And we're working with the U.S. administration, we're working with others in the industry, and we're working with our supply chain on mitigations to ensure the best outcome for our ecosystem of customers and partners as well as our shareholders. 
 So clearly, the implementation of incremental tariffs on the complete list of products imported from China would have industry-wide impacts. The impact would likely be more felt in the near term. And Steve, you might have some additional comment. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. In terms of the levers, we do have a number of levers that we would expect to use to mitigate the growth exposure from these tariffs down to a net exposure. This does include optimizing our manufacturing facilities around the world, adjustments to pricing and other items. We would plan to use these mitigations to drive down, again, to a net impact. I do want to emphasize -- or reemphasize what Dion said, because the specifics are absolutely essential around any assumptions or any quantification of what the net impact could be. We are assuming, however -- and these were the scenarios we're working through, that we would experience more of a shorter-term impact that would diminish over time. And to be clear, again, our guidance, both the EPS and free cash flow, does include impacts of the tariffs currently in place but not any contemplation of the additional tariffs under consideration. 
Operator: And the next questioner will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: You talked a lot on the last earnings call about this increased reception to purchasing remanufactured supplies online particularly in Europe. And I think a widespread investor concern is, do you believe that that's a structural issue now that you've had 90 more days to think and look and gather data on it? So specifically, are you seeing any evidence that -- of that occurring in other geographies? And you talked about some new inputs into the 4-box model around price and share. So given those inputs and given whether you consider a remand -- increased remand to be structural or cyclical, what is your belief for what normalized Supplies growth should be going forward? And do you actually reach that in 2020? 
Dion Weisler: Right. Thanks, Toni. Thanks for the question. I'll take the first one, and Steve, you might want to take the second. So if I catch you correctly, your -- to paraphrase it, the Supplies online issues spreading into other regions, i.e., Americas or APJ. As we said in the last call, the underlying factors around the shift to online and contractual are absolutely global in nature. And we live in a very connected world. Both Americas and APJ both begun addressing these trends earlier than EMEA did. Therefore, our primary focus remains EMEA. That said, the competition doesn't stand still and neither will we. We're sharing the learnings from the global task force with the other regions to ensure a consistent approach. As we will continue to monitor these trends in every single region, we'll fine-tune, we'll adjust as the market conditions will inevitably evolve. That's why I have a global program management office around this and we are looking at this from a global perspective, but the real primary focus remains in EMEA because Americas and APJ got started earlier. 
Steven Fieler: Toni, the specific -- I'm going to give you numbers. So maybe starting with Q2, our Q2 result of minus 3% was something that's in line with our expectations. And a similar trend is Q1. The decline was driven primarily from EMEA. I would say broadly speaking, our forecast assumptions are holding as we look into the remainder of '19. There is no change to our full year outlook. We're still expecting approximately minus 3% in constant currency. This would include the remaining takedown of the channel inventory and also the revised share and pricing assumptions described on the last call. It is difficult to pinpoint the precise timing of all the reduction between Q3 and Q4, so it could be some slight quarterly growth rate variability along with other natural business movements. It's all too dependent on the timing of the actions and how they play through the ecosystem. 
 In regards to -- I guess beyond FY '19, it's going to depend on multiple factors and multiple variables and the progress we're making around installed base and the type of units we're placing, usage, the share and pricing as well as any evolution in our business model. And so I'm not going to comment any more specifically on FY '20 or beyond at this point. 
Toni Sacconaghi: But just a follow-up, Steve, I mean if you're explicitly saying that you made a change in share and price assumption in your 4-box model, I presume both of those were not positive. They were negative. And so if that's the case, then why wouldn't the structural longer-term Supplies growth rate be lower than what you had thought before? And why -- if you're taking down all the inventory, why wouldn't we be at that normalized rate in 2020? 
Steven Fieler: Well, you're correct that the assumptions -- change in assumptions were to the negative. We did bring down our share assumptions for the remainder of this year as well as pricing. That's not to suggest that the actions that Dion described can't move those in either direction. And ideally, we're working to move those up and to have share, win back programs as well as to drive more consistent pricing across the ecosystem, including the omnichannel. And so those are the actions we're working clearly to make sure we're addressing the Supplies headwinds we're facing this year. 
Dion Weisler: And that's really, Toni, why I break the actions down into operational issues, which we do expect to have an impact on those levers as well as the longer-term strategic focus areas, evolving our print focus, driving more towards contractual business and adopting new business models within the print business unit. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Milunovich: Hewlett Packard Enterprise just indicated that they've been seeing fairly recently, I guess maybe over the last 4 to 6 weeks, a slowdown in business, maybe a shifting out of business into the next quarter. Are you seeing anything like that? It doesn't look like you're seeing it on the PC side, but I would think on the commercial printer side, you might have some sense of that. So are you sensing that larger accounts are taking longer to close? 
Steven Fieler: We saw strength in Commercial. So I wouldn't highlight anything beyond that strength in Commercial. 
Steven Milunovich: Okay. And Steve, you talked about trying to front-end-load printer revenue a little bit more. Beyond contractual, are there other things that you're thinking you can do? And how significant could that be and how long might it take? 
Steven Fieler: So when I sort of made the comment on new business model evolution, there are sort of multiple dimensions to that. I think the primary one we've been focused on, what you alluded to, is the shift to contractual. And so we've been at that for some time and continue to make progress around our management services revenue as well as shifting more to Instant Ink, which continues to grow for the company. So I think that's been our primary driver. In terms of the sort of -- where the profit and the lifetime value of our hardware unit is, we already are operating in certain geographies where we do have printers that generate more profit of the lifetime upfront. And so I think we'll continue to work on different areas and different models in the future, but there's really not a whole lot more to describe at this point. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. 
Paul Coster: Two questions in view of the tariffs. I'm wondering if you've identified any vulnerabilities or risks in your supply chain and whether there's any major sort of reconfigurations that you anticipate. How, if at all, that should mitigate the risk there? And the second one, just quick update on the metals printing and 3D Printing, if you can give us some sense of the time line again. 
Dion Weisler: Look, we have manufacturing facilities, as you can imagine, all over the world, and we're always working to optimize our manufacturing footprint. So this is just an ongoing part of our business so that we are not single-point sensitive. So that's how I think you should think about our manufacturing footprint and our facilities. 
 As it relates to metals, look, I'm really happy with the progress of the 3D Printing business unit on multiple dimensions, not just the metals dimension for which they've made really good progress. We have some several companies like GKN that we're working with to serve the auto industry. We have similar efforts underway in the health care industry. But we continue to perform well in the 3D Printing business. We recently announced that over 10 million parts were produced using our 3D Printing technology last year, with half of the parts manufactured for end-user products. 
 In -- quarter 2 was a busy quarter. We launched our new HP Jet Fusion 5200 series, which is a printing platform that delivers improved economics and performance and part quality, really designed for manufacturing. We also launched a new TPU material. And for those of you that want to geek out with me here, it really enables new classes of applications ideal for flexible and elastic parts. We also expanded our alliances with BASF, Materialise and Siemens, a very important announcement with Siemens just last week. And really, they're at the epicenter of all manufacturing. If you want to get into manufacturing processes, you need to be doing that with companies that have been doing it for decades, and Siemens is an industry leader. 
 We also announced last week a major, incredible partnership between HP and SmileDirectClub, who's the leader in teledentistry, and they're really set to disrupt the orthodontics industry. SmileDirectClub will be deploying a fleet of 49 HP 3D Printing systems, produce more than 50,000 unique and highly personalized molds a day. And that's one of the largest 3D Printing manufacturing projects in the United States, and that's a true example of an industrial-scale 3D production. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. 
Matthew Cabral: On Personal Systems, just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the impact of component costs particularly given some of the renewed declines in DRAM and just if you happen to pass that through versus the ability to drop some of that down to the bottom line. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. Yes. I think broadly speaking, we have seen some easing around the overall supply chain cost in the basket of kind of commodities and logistics. That being said, given the current currency environment and volatility we're seeing in the strengthening of the dollar, we've seen much of that offset. And kind of even looking forward, likely, the increased headwinds will continue to be an offset of some of the changes we've seen in the overall supply chain costs. So exactly how this is going to play out in the next quarter or quarters to come will really depend upon overall market and competitive dynamics as we've got some puts and takes as it relates to the overall cost on the Personal Systems side. 
Matthew Cabral: Got it. And then on Printing, just wondering if you could provide an update on how the Apogee acquisition is playing out so far and just what the learnings from that mean for your wider distribution strategy as you push more towards A3 over time. 
Dion Weisler: Look. Let me start out by mentioning it's now been several quarters since the acquisition of Apogee. And while we're running it as a stand-alone business from a go-to-market perspective, it's very much aggregated into our overall OPS business unit. I'll also remind you that Apogee enables HP to gain access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services, and then it accelerates the deployment of what we know is superior technology into the growing contractual office printing market, especially among SMBs. The transaction augments our existing go-to-market channels, and it enhances our ability to deliver solutions and services that are necessary to win in the contractual market. This is all on point and on strategy, and more and more customers are shifting to contractual. So we feel, as we did when we made the acquisition, that this is absolutely leading us in the right direction. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I also have 2. I guess the first is, can you talk a little bit -- you mentioned uncertainty in the environment, which just makes sense these days. But can you provide some more details on what you're seeing geographically in terms of demand and specifically maybe what you're seeing in China with regard to U.S. brands? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: Look, I'll give a first stab. So what we saw in our results in constant currency was Americas was down 1%, EMEA up 2%, and APJ up 11%. In Americas, I think we saw -- the driver there was primarily on the Personal Systems business. And candidly, I think that was driven by the industry-wide supply constraints we had and how we ultimately allocated a product. And I think that was the largest driver in the Americas. I think we're seeing different geographic pockets of strength in those that are softening and maybe Dion with a comment on China specifically. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look -- yes, I think we've experienced some recent slowing in our China business. And having said that, I think it's important to mention that we can't conclude that, that slowdown that we are seeing is solely related to any of the discussions that are currently underway. China has been and continues to be a strategically important market for us. We have a really strong brand in the country, and we've been there for decades. The geopolitical environment remains, let's call it, dynamic, and we'll continue to assess and respond to the situation and the potential impact to our business. 
 That said, we continue to drive insight-driven innovation to our portfolio. That's one of the ways in which we go about running our business. It's through local insights and local product development. For example, in China, gaming has been a great success for us, including the most recent launch of our dual-screen OMEN gaming laptop, which we launched globally out of China. It's also worth noting our APJ region, just as Steve mentioned, as a whole, grew 11% in constant currency in quarter 2 against that backdrop of a slowing business in China. So we're seeing, for example, other areas within APJ, like Japan, being particularly strong. 
Shannon Cross: And then maybe Dion, if you can talk a little bit about the relationship with Canon. I'm just curious, do you feel like you're working more closely with them given some of the pressures on toner and the need to reposition against the aftermarket? And do you think they're reacting as aggressively as you'd like from a litigation standpoint? Because I know they have started talking about it a bit more than they had historically. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, Shannon, as you know -- you've been following us a long time, we have an incredibly close, 35-year partnership with Canon, and I think it is stronger now than it has ever been. I just came back from Japan a couple of weeks ago and met with Mitarai-san. Clearly, aftermarket alternatives is not what we would want, either of us. And we're working very closely together to really think through the multidimensional levers that we have available to us. And I think both companies are being appropriately aggressive. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: I just wanted to drill into the consumer PC deterioration, net revenue down 9%. It was up by 1% last quarter. And I just wondered if maybe you can comment on, regionally, where you saw that. And maybe we can tie it back to your other comments but I'd love it if you would give us some color. And also, just comment on whether you think that in those regions, you're seeing -- I heard you talk about Asia and China in particular, Dion, but just kind of what you're seeing from a consumer demand point of view across the globe? 
Dion Weisler: Look, I'll take a first stab. Steve might want to chime in. I guess on a macro level, there's been volatility in the market, and that causes uncertainty around the world. And in this type of environment, consumers tend to react more quickly to market conditions both on the positive side and on the negative side versus commercial customers, which has less sensitivity to the short term. The current environment has seen some slowing in Consumer in varying levels by country, and it will take us a long time to go through every single country. But it does vary country by country. We continue to innovate. That's the most important point. We need to continue to innovate with our products, like the Tango X in the Printing side of the business and the Spectre Folio in the Personal Systems, just to name 2 examples. And when we do that, we're giving consumers a reason to purchase, because they only do that when they have great innovation. 
 So while we broadly agree with the industry views that both PCs and print are flattish markets over the mid- to long term, we'll continue to play our own game. We'll segment the market then we'll segment it again. We'll find the heat in the market, and we'll focus on outperforming the market. That's exactly what we've been doing and what you can expect us to do. 
Steven Fieler: Maybe one other small comment to add is our Consumer performance is really in line with the market. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Just 2, if I could, real quick, and they're sort of partial clarification. Just going back to the supply dynamics, do you feel that you've fully identified the problem areas such that you have your arms completely around the dynamics that manifested last quarter? And if not yet, what remains to be done? How long until you think you'd do? I just want to make sure I'm fully understanding where you are with it. And then I have a quick follow-up as well. 
Steven Fieler: So the short answer is yes. We -- as Dion said, we put a task force of our most talented individuals. Both Dion and I have spent time in EMEA, and I think Dion described some of the actions we're doing. We would expect that these actions and in particular the impact on the overall channel inventory levels, which I sized at approximately $100 million, including the downstream, that those channel inventories would be reduced through this year. 
Ananda Baruah: Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then a quick follow-up. I believe your comment around chipset constraints was into 3Q. Does that imply that you think after 3Q, you'll actually start to get some relief? And any context there in addition would be helpful with that. 
Dion Weisler: Look, I guess you are referring to the fairly well-known Intel shortage, which has come along with chipsets that go with it. I'd start by saying it's probably not fair or appropriate for me to second-guess the supply updates that Intel has provided over the past several weeks. Based on the most recent update from Intel, we continue to expect supply constraints through calendar quarter 3 just as we had through calendar quarter 2 and calendar quarter 1. I think you've seen us optimize as best we can on behalf of our customers and partners. The demand is really strong for our products, particularly in Commercial. And we'll continue to work closely with Intel to ensure that we drive the best outcomes. 
 So thank you all for taking the time to be with us. We're at the bottom of the hour. Let me end the call where I began. We're delivering on our plan, and we're striking the right balance between driving performance for today as well as investing for the long term. While we will always have more work to do, we're making good progress against our priorities. We'll continue to put our customers at the center of everything we do and we will remain consistent and true to our strategy to engineer experiences that amaze while driving profitable growth. And I have a high degree of confidence that we'll continue to execute on that strategy with rigor and focus. So thank you very much for joining us today. 
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you all for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2019 Q1  (2019-02-27 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2019 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is William, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. And I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2019 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

 And now I'll turn it over to Dion. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. In Q1, we once again delivered top and bottom line growth. We continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our EPS, generate free cash flow, and we remained focused on positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth. 
 While this quarter had many areas of strength and progress against our plan, there was an unexpected challenge in supplies, and we have more work to do there. First, let me cover the highlights for the quarter and then talk about the business more broadly. 
 In quarter 1, we delivered revenue of $14.7 billion, up 1% or up 2% in constant currency; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52, an increase of 8% and in line with our outlook. And we generated strong free cash flow of approximately $700 million, returning almost $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends.
 Our results demonstrate the continued vitality of our innovation across the portfolio as well as our ability to execute and adapt in a tough environment. Our strategy remains consistent, and a key part of that strategy is our focus on continuing to refine our business model to match changing customer needs and market conditions. This is one of the core strengths of our organization. We have a proven track record of leveraging change to create opportunity.
 Let's go through the performance of each of our businesses, starting with Personal Systems. Our Personal Systems team continues to perform at a high level, driven by a relentless focus on execution and profitable growth. In quarter 1, Personal Systems revenue grew 2% and delivered strong 4.2% operating margins. We are improving our product mix and managing our costs. As expected, the first half headwinds we previously shared with you are playing out, and we are navigating them well. We are also strengthening our position in strategic segments where we see pockets of growth and delivering differentiated and premium hardware, services and solutions. 
 In January, we kicked off CES with a bold lineup of innovative firsts for modern lifestyles, changing workplaces and immersive gaming. For consumers, we introduced the new Spectre x360, the world's first 15-inch laptop with an AMOLED display for exceptional clarity and color. We announced the world's first Quantum Dot on Glass display, providing movie theater-quality visuals at home. And we showcased the world's first AMD-based Chromebook, bringing the power of cloud applications to a broader range of customers. 
 We also introduced solutions designed to power the workforce, workplace and work styles of the future. We launched the third-generation of HP Sure View technology, further protecting users against digital hacking. And with more than 70% of U.S. workplaces using open-concept designs, we unveiled the world's first display and first all-in-one with an integrated privacy screen, giving workers confidence in their security and privacy. 
 We also expanded our gaming portfolio with innovation that creates even more immersive experiences to take gaming to new heights. We debuted the world's first 65-inch gaming display with integrated sound bar and launched the new OMEN 15, featuring HP's fastest display refresh rate, 240 hertz, to help gamers stay ahead of the competition.
 We also remained focused on driving innovation and growth in key vertical segments. This quarter, we introduced a variety of education-centric Chromebooks. Simple, secure and shareable devices that enable schools to empower the next generation of innovators and leaders. And in retail, we launched a new point-of-sale solution including a strategic collaboration with PayPal, specifically designed for small- and medium-sized retailers and hospitality owners.
 In print, while we have made progress against our strategy, growing hardware revenue, share and operating profit dollars, our supplies performance did not meet our expectations this quarter. So this is what I want to cover first.
 Supplies revenue was weaker than anticipated, particularly in EMEA, where supplies declined 9%. As you know, we look at our supplies business in terms of our 4-box model: in store base, usage, share and price. The 2 factors that varied from our plan were a decline in share and, to a lesser extent, pricing. We saw this most significantly in our commercial channels, which is having the largest impact on office supplies. There are several factors contributing to the change in customer purchasing behavior. All commercial customers are purchasing supplies online, and while we have leading share online, it's at a lower percentage than our share with traditional commercial resellers and in-store retailers. In addition, as macro uncertainty has increased, we have seen further price sensitivity among customers, pressuring both our share and our supplies pricing. The combination of these 2 factors negatively impacted HP Supplies share. It also changes our assumptions in the 4-box model for the remainder of the year. As a result, we no longer expect supplies to be flat to slightly up in fiscal '19. 
 On a related note, we continued to maintain the levels of channel inventory under our Tier 1 ceiling and monitor Tier 2 inventory, where we had some visibility. However, we continue to fulfill orders likely over multiple quarters based on our regional share assumptions, which we now believe were overestimated. This resulted in additional HP supplies in the ecosystem, including the unmonitored downstream portion. In summary, this is what led to the challenges in supplies. 
 Now let me tell you what we're going to do about it, and Steve will provide additional details. We are taking actions to lower the level of supplies inventory in the market to be consistent with our new share assumptions. And we are implementing additional share improvement plans, including online programs, targeted marketing and brand protection to promote the value of HP original supplies in terms of quality, sustainability and environmental impact. The team's agility and ability to respond to challenges gives me confidence in how we'll manage through this environment. We are taking action, and importantly, we are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow outlook for the full year.
 As Enrique talked about at our Securities Analyst Meeting, our markets are changing, and we must keep evolving our business and business models. This is why we are focused on accelerating our strategy to more contractual sales, which we expect will have 2 benefits: diversifying our profit pool through services and securing a higher share of the supplies for these units. Both Instant Ink and Managed Print Services are examples of these models. The Instant Ink subscriber base continues to have impressive growth. We have now rolled out the program in 18 countries and continue to see strong adoption rates. In Managed Print Services, our machines-in-field number is growing double digits, and we are scaling our MPS coverage with expanded opportunities for our premier channel partners in both the A3 and A4 categories. 
 We are also evolving our business to include products that generate a larger portion of their lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. This includes not only products like Sprocket but also our HP Smart Tank and HP Ink Tank printers that can print up to 8,000 color pages before more ink is required. These printers not only deliver strong total cost of ownership, they deliver the quality and durability that customers expect from HP Original Ink. Our print innovation continues to help define this business. 
 In home, printing products like HP Tango X, the world's first smart app-based home printer, are helping us to make printing relevant again in modern homes and to a new generation of users. This quarter, Tango launched in APJ and expanded into new countries in EMEA. This printer is being called the smartest and most elegant printer on the market.
 In office printing, our push into the contractual A3 market continues with the introduction of finishing capabilities on a range of systems that help to drive affordable color printing, best-in-class performance and energy efficiency. We now have 9% A3 market share, which is up 1.1 points since last year. 
 In graphics, we introduced a design-to-print portfolio at Autodesk University to help users experience the speed and simplicity of HP PageWide XL and large-format printing solutions. This kind of innovation, paired with our transition to services, is how we'll reinvent the print category and deliver on our long-term opportunities.
 Looking at the 3D Printing business, we're expanding both our production and prototyping installed base across the automotive, industrial, consumer and health care markets. Millions of final production parts are now being produced each quarter on the Multi Jet Fusion platform, and the range of applications being printed is incredible. 
 As part of our Multi Jet Fusion portfolio expansion, this quarter, we began ramping shipments of our 300/500 solutions targeted at the prototyping market. We also continued to execute on our 3D Printing metals technology, with partners including Volkswagen and GKN. 
 As I speak with CEOs across multiple industries, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is here and is shaping up to be one of the most significant opportunities of our lifetime. The future of manufacturing and production is digital and is becoming a mainstream topic as businesses look to change the way they design, manufacture and deliver new products to their customers. Leaders from the corporate world, government and academia recognize there is incredible potential to not only unlock new economic growth but to also drive a more sustainable industrial revolution with new and reskilled workers. HP is leading the industry forward to democratize manufacturing with our 3D Printing technology. This continues to be an enormously exciting part of our business.
 To sum up, HP delivered results consistent with our financial outlook, and we are generating strong cash flow and investing in the future to create long-term value. We know we have work to do to manage through the current supplies dynamics, and that's exactly what we're going to do. 
 We will continue to play our own game, execute our strategy with rigor and focus on driving sustainable long-term growth. Our markets will continue to change and evolve, and we will focus on adapting and reinventing. 
 With that, I'll pass the call over to Steve to go through additional details. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Dion. Looking at the company's Q1 financial results, we delivered revenue growth, with non-GAAP EPS growing even faster. And while our respective business results were mixed, we are making good progress across our core, growth and future strategy in important areas. In others, we have more work to do. As always, we will continue to balance where to invest and capture opportunities on one hand and where to drive efficiency or fix challenges on the other, all with a focus on creating long-term shareholder value.
 Looking at the details of the first quarter, starting with the top line. Net revenue was $14.7 billion, up 1% or up 2% in constant currency. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas declined 2%, EMEA was up 2% and APJ grew 11%. Gross margin was 17.8%, flat year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margins were up 20 basis points, driven by improved rate in both Personal Systems and Print. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.6 billion, up 1% driven by an increase in SG&A. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $57 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.52, up $0.04 or 8%, with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $29 million, acquisition-related charges of $10 million, restructuring and other charges of $55 million, nonoperating retirement-related credits of $12 million, tax adjustments of $55 million and a tax-related impact on all of these items. As a result, Q1 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.51. 
 At the segment level, in Personal Systems, we are pleased with our results and ability to navigate the current environment. We have demonstrated a strong track record of execution and financial performance, and demand for our products remains strong. Revenue in the first quarter was $9.7 billion, up 2% against a tough year-over-year compare and industry-wide supply constraint. Operating profit was $410 million, up $75 million versus last year. Operating margins were 4.2%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by better pricing and mix, partially offset by higher costs and currency. Sequentially, operating margins were up 50 basis points, driven by better pricing and mix as well as cost favorability, partially offset by currency. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 1%, and commercial revenue was up 3%. By product category, revenue was up 6% for notebooks, down 3% for desktops and up 3% for workstations. In calendar quarter 4, our market share was 23.6%. We continued to execute our strategy and focus on growth areas such as premium and gaming, and at the same time, leveraged the scale of our business including our supply chain and go-to-market. 
 In print, our results were more challenged. We grew hardware revenue, increased our unit share and continued to make progress in our contractual offerings. However, this performance was offset by disappointing total supplies revenue. Let me start with some comments on supplies, and then I'll summarize the rest of the print results. First quarter Supplies revenue was $3.3 billion, down 3%, which is below our expectation, driven primarily by EMEA. During the quarter, we saw a slowdown in sell-through from Tier 1 to Tier 2 channels. Therefore, consistent with our Supplies sales model, we reduced our revenue sell-in so that we would maintain channel inventory levels below our Tier 1 ceiling. The size of the slowdown made it increasingly apparent that inventory had grown in the ecosystem, including the downstream portion beyond our reporting visibility. This was supported by new share insights. Previously, we had relied primarily on lagging and incomplete market share surveys. But as the installed base of newer, connected toner-based products has increased and become more statistically significant in key geographies, we have gained incremental telemetry data. This new telemetry data indicated that HP's Supplies share, and particularly in our office business, was significantly lower than what we had assumed in our 4-box model. We have sized what the potential incremental inventory impact is in the ecosystem as well as changed our go-forward Supplies growth assumptions. As a result, as Dion described, we expect to lower the inventory in the entire ecosystem enabled by reducing our Tier 1 channel inventory. The impact of this action will create an approximately $100 million headwind to Supplies revenue for the remainder of FY '19 or roughly 1% of total Supplies revenue. We expect this impact, combined with the lower go-forward Supplies share and pricing assumption, to result in Supplies revenue decline of approximately 3% for the year.
 In addition, it is important that we tighten the levels of total inventory available in the ecosystem going forward. By doing this, pricing should improve. Therefore, we will be fine-tuning our operations and further reducing our channel inventory ceilings. Also, we need to enhance our business management system, including more telemetry data to improve the quality of our inputs. Our 4-box model is only as good as its assumptions. With some of our recent enhancements in both big data and software and an increasing installed base of newer, connected toner-based products, we expect to have an increasingly clearer picture of office supplies share.
 The 4-box model remains our best predictor of Supplies demand. It does require a combination of data analytics and judgment to accurately forecast our Supplies results. Finally, it's important that we continue making the right returns-based investments, including the investments required to win back share. We have made good progress with previously implemented cost actions, which help support these investments, and we will continue to focus on a lean cost structure going forward.
 Now looking at the Print business overall, total Q1 revenue was $5.1 billion, flat year-over-year. Operating profit grew $22 million versus the prior year. And operating margin was 16.2%, up 50 basis points. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin improvement were expense management, partially offset by unfavorable gross margin. Total hardware units were up 3%, with commercial units up 4% and consumer units up 2%. In calendar quarter 4, HP's market share was 41.1%, while the overall market declined. We continued to take advantage of opportunities to place NPV-positive units. 
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow from operations was $862 million, and free cash flow was $673 million. In Q1, the cash conversion cycle was minus 35 days. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle improved 3 days, with a 3-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 1-day increase in days sales outstanding and a 1-day decrease in days of inventory. We returned $720 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $249 million via cash dividends in Q1. 
 Looking forward to the rest of FY '19, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook. We continue to expect a headwind from currency. In Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints through the first half of calendar 2019 with improvements in the second half. And we expect the cost from the overall basket of components and logistics to improve compared to Q1 levels. In print, we expect Supplies revenue to be approximately minus 3% for the remainder of the fiscal year. For corporate investments and other, we expect the quarterly run rate expense to be approximately $175 million per quarter. Also, as I have said before, we remain committed to driving productivity and investing for growth at the same time. Effective cost management remains a critical element of our success in very competitive markets, and we'll continue looking for ways to operate more efficiently and effectively. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection to be 16% in FY '19. 
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook. Q2 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53. Q2 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.45 to $0.48. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22. We expect full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.10 and full year free cash flow of at least $3.7 billion. We continue to expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full year. 
 And now let's open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And today's first questioner will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I wanted to understand -- and you gave a lot of disclosure during the call on Supplies. But I guess, Dion, when you look at it, I mean, is this something that can be fixed to get back to flat? Is it -- I know it's secular. But one, I guess, would have thought with the copier initiative and what's going on in 3D Printing and some of the other growthier areas that you'd be able to offset some of the core pressures.  So I guess, maybe from a bigger picture standpoint, how are you thinking about this business over time? And should we think about it long term as something that's stable? Or will it just be sort of a constant decline? And then I have a follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Great. Thanks, Shannon, for the question. I'll try to summarize it in terms of if we accept that, really it was a loss of share and, to a lesser extent, pricing, the question is, why we're losing share? And what are we going to do about it? It's true that these challenges versus third-party alternatives are not new. We're essentially fighting the same war, but we're now engaging on a new battlefield, and it's called online. Historically, we've been very strong in our traditional channels, including both retail and the commercial channel. You see, online offers a growing route to market for alternatives. And we're seeing more of our commercial customers moving to online, where our overall share, while still leading, is not as large. The growth of online and the access it enables for reman and aftermarket alternative is also creating incentives for aftermarket alternative manufacturers to invest in breaking in on better technology faster. And this has resulted in a faster deceleration in our aftermarket share on some newer platforms than we expected through this route to market. So while we've been expanding our presence in the omnichannel, we need to do it faster, and we need to do it more effectively. We need new weapons to fight on the new battlefield. We just can't bring a musket to a drone fight. So most importantly, what are we going to do about it? First, we need to continue to evolve our go-to-market and expand our online initiatives as well as our targeted marketing, and we'll certainly be doing that. The second thing we have to do is we've got to expand our order processes to protect our brand and discourage counterfeit and other IP infringements. We've got to support the value proposition of original supplies in terms of quality, sustainability as well as environmental impact. Thirdly, we have to shift our business models in order to diversify our product pool for services and securing a high share of the supplies for those units. Both Instant Ink and Managed Print Services are great examples of these models. And then finally, we've got to also evolve our business to include products that generate a larger portion of the lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. So we know the situation that we're in. We've named it, and we also know what we need to do about it. 
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then can you just talk maybe, Steve, a bit about cash flow? You maintained the cash flow. I know it's still early in the year. But given the pressure on Supplies, where are your other levers that you're going to be pulling? And how susceptible is it if we do see more of a PC slowdown? Just, I guess, your comfort level with the cash flow guidance. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I guess, for starters, I am comfortable with the at least $3.7 billion. Similar to what we've done in prior quarters, when we look at our free cash flow outlook, we do take into account our forecast on earnings, our volume, especially in Personal Systems and cash conversion cycle. And then from an earnings perspective, while we do have the challenge in Supplies, we are taking actions, including cost actions, to address some of that. So net-net, on our earnings, volume and CCC perspective, I feel confident in the guide. And as I mentioned last quarter, worth repeating, we finished Q2 with a negative cash conversion cycle of minus 35 days compared to minus 32 days at the end of Q4. I'd acknowledge that we would likely have some upside to that minus 32 days at the end of last quarter. I still see that as potential upside, which helps further confirm and give confidence in the at least $3.7 billion number. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Wamsi Mohan: Dion, can you talk about why you're seeing this particularly in EMEA in Supplies and the risk that this spreads to other regions as well? And how confident are you about this prediction of 3% decline you -- and that you have actually captured an appropriate amount of data and telemetry that's guiding that given that this is not the first time that we'll see the Supplies reset? And I have one more question. 
Dion Weisler: Yes, no problems, Wamsi. I'll start, and I'm sure Steve may want to chime in as well. I guess, the underlying cause as we outlined during the call, was the surprise around our assumptions about share were wrong, and it was most specifically in EMEA. There are 2 main drivers that I'll comment on. The first is the omnichannel impact, and the second is our operational visibility. Let me start with the omnichannel. The omnichannel and the consumer preferences to buy online are definitely not new. What we've seen is more commercial customers purchasing online. And while our online business has been growing significantly and we have leading share online, it's at a lower percentage than our share with traditional commercial resellers and install retailers. Where we went wrong is that we had incorrect Supplies share assumptions in our 4-box model regarding the plans for Supplies selling in quarter 1 '19 and in prior quarters. This made it very difficult to spot the buying behavior change as a trend. It didn't necessarily all happen in Q1, but now that we understand the trend better, it has driven a change in our expectations for share going forward. In addition to that, the macro uncertainty has also increased, and we've seen further price sensitivity among customers pressuring both our share and our Supplies pricing. If I turn to operational issues, since we don't have much visibility into the downstream channel ecosystem and we were maintaining CI levels below our Tier 1 ceiling, we did not see clearly enough that we had an issue. However, we saw lower sell-through during the course of quarter 1 and adjusted our operational plans to reduce shipments, consistent with our Supplies sales model. We also received new share analytics. It's a really important point, and we were able to triangulate that our revised share assumptions were below our previous ones. And so in retrospect, when the new share insights are applied, we believe that our inventories in the ecosystem -- in the whole ecosystem began growing in prior quarters. However, the prior share assumptions made it hard to call this out as a trend as it was masking the underlying problem. And as a result of that, we've adjusted our go-forward 4-box assumptions and sizing inventory impact, as Steve talked about, to be approximately $100 million. 
Steven Fieler: So then I'll just add to that and address more specifically on the extent beyond EMEA and then even the sizing of that $100 million. So in Q1, certainly, the revenue weakness and the incorrect share assumptions were primarily in EMEA. And while the multi-tier channel dynamics that have been described are not unique to EMEA, they are more prevalent there. That said, the competitive trends are global, and both the changes in the customer buying with more commercial customers purchasing supplies online and the pricing that Dion just referred to are more macro in nature. And therefore, when we revisited our 4-box assumptions, we did look at all regions and revised our share and pricing accordingly, and that's all embedded in our guidance. And then specifically, I think you indicated this is what happened before. In terms of the channel itself, just to put context, we're talking roughly 1% of our total Supplies stream of over $13 billion. And while there are some things that are clear with data, there are others that we need to triangulate on. And we can't be precise on all fronts, especially because we don't have visibility into the entire downstream unmonitored ecosystem. So our approach here was to triangulate on a channel inventory number across the ecosystem by analyzing different data points. We compared our old share assumptions with the revised one that have been informed by big data, and we also looked at prior selling statistics and CI trends. We then estimated how much additional downstream channel inventory may exist, and we believe $100 million is the right estimate. 
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Appreciate that. And then if I could just quickly follow up. Can you talk about the longer-term print margin assumptions for the segment now, given that we're talking about some structural headwinds here on Supplies? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So we obviously delivered 16.2% in the quarter. And when we entered FY '19, Dion and I had a good conversation. We actually took proactive steps to address some of the growing global uncertainty we saw at the time and began some targeted expense reductions. We didn't anticipate this Supplies challenge, but we saw, we reacted quickly and further tightened OpEx. It's important that we continue investing in the areas where we expect good returns, like our growth initiatives, placing the right units and evolving our business model to be more contractual. So that's important for us to continue. It is why, though, that we must continue to drive more productivity and more efficiency in the model. I do acknowledge that maintaining the 16% going forward is tougher, given the Supplies challenge, but it does remain our target. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Just following up on the Printer Supplies discussion. It sounds like some of the visibility into market share came on the back of the telemetry data, which is something that you've talked about for a couple of years. Why this quarter did that show you a picture that actual market share was different than you thought? Why weren't the systems flagging that ahead of time? And do you have to invest in technology so that you can get better insights out of that data? And then I have a follow up. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Katy. To help you understand it better, let me explain a little bit about our methodology that drives the share assumptions we use on office supplies, which is primarily toner-based, and how it's changed. It's worth noting that it's different than ink-based products, where we've historically had more telemetry data. Previously, we had used periodic third-party survey data and market research aggregators to estimate toner supply shares. We did not have a statistically significant sample from the system telemetry and the instrumentation nor the capabilities to calculate share for toner-based products in the installed base. We've had this data for ink-based products, but due to the limited number of machines that were phoning home in commercial due to enterprise firewall constraints and otherwise unconnected devices, we've had to build the connected installed base over time. And so with the increasing mix of newer products and the growth of the connected installed base, combined with improvements in big data, we've been able to move to a better source of share data based on system telemetry. It's worth noting that the share we calculate through big data reflects the share at the time the customer hits the print button, which may be months after they actually purchase the supplies. So when the new share insights are applied, we believe that the inventory in the ecosystem had been growing during quarter 1 and previous quarters. And the combined effect of the change in market dynamics impacting share and the lack of visibility to the change resulted in excess HP supplies in the market and lower Tier 1 channel sell-through. Having said all that, we will obviously need to continue to refine the telemetry data and our instrumentation and business management system as we move forward. 
Kathryn Huberty: And then just shifting the discussion to PCs, how is the industry reacting to lower memory prices? Is that at all getting passed through in prices to customers? Or was holding onto the lower cost a contributor to the margin expansion for both you and some of your peers this quarter? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. When we looked at our margin in Q1 and certainly, the ASP portion of that, the large sort of greater than 50% increase in the ASPs was actually driven by mix, with the remainder being overall pricing dynamics. And we did see some favorability from Q4 to Q1. We'd expect continued favorability from Q1 to Q2 on the overall commodities. Exactly how this will play out in our margins going forward is going to depend, though, on overall market and pricing dynamics. Obviously, we've got currency volatility we continue to see, and likely headwinds from currency will partially offset some of the tailwinds we are seeing on commodity costs. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Your guidance for EPS for Q2 is a little bit -- the midpoint of it is a little bit below Street consensus. Should we interpret that as you're feeling now more confident in the low end of your EPS guidance, particularly in light of the Supplies news? Or do you believe that consensus has mismodeled seasonality for the year? And I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I think in general, our Q2 EPS guide is in line with normal seasonality. And I think the comment was on the full year, so maybe I'll comment on the full year and get back to Q2. Full year, we are maintaining our guide at $2.12 to $2.22 non-GAAP EPS. Confident we can deliver across the various puts and takes. We have factored in now the lower Supplies revenue; the CPU constraints, which we had already taken into account; and FX headwinds. We have multiple levers to offset. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to continue driving cost management whether they be in-flight initiatives that we can accelerate or continued push around digital transformation. I mentioned the components on the prior call -- or excuse me, prior question. And so how much of that sticks, again, is to be seen. So we do have levers. But if I reflect back at SAM when I laid out the FY '19 guidance and broke it up between the segments, which was about $0.05 to $0.12 of the year-over-year increase, and shares and other about $0.05 to $0.08 of the year-over-year increase, I think we're generally in line with that. On the segments, more strength in Personal Systems, and now we have some challenge on the Print overall. And on the corporate and other, have a year-over-year favorability on shares, to a lesser extent, OI&E. But we are investing more in corporate investments and other. So net-net, I feel confident holding the midpoint of our guide. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just back to Supplies. So if Europe is a third of your business and was down 9%, that suggests that Supplies outside of Europe was down 0. And I guess, the question would be, why does the rest of the world not start to migrate towards sort of negative sell-through growth on a go-forward basis? And accordingly, why do you have confidence in minus 3% growth? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, clearly the issue in Q1 was and pertained to EMEA. And even the share delta from the assumptions that we previously had to what we now view as our share was, primarily, the delta was in EMEA. That being said, we looked and reanalyzed the entire business across all regions. And the minus 3%, we believe, is a prudent guide. It does take into account both, number one, the channel inventory in the entire ecosystem. Again, it's about a point of it, the $100 million takedown. And the second is we did revise our shares and pricing assumptions worldwide. So net-net, we think that it's the right way to look at the business even though the issue in Q1 was primarily EMEA-based. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Milunovich: Just one question. In the past, at some of the SAM meetings, you've talked about $1 billion negative hit from commodity costs. I'm just curious, how much of a positive are you expecting this year in the swing? One would expect it could be quite substantial. You've also, in the past, talked about the ability to offset that by taking out $1 billion of costs annually in the business. And just said that's the normal course thing we have to do. Are you still on track to take out about $1 billion from the cost base? 
Steven Fieler: So let me respond to that. So on the first piece, actually, on a year-over-year basis, costs and commodity costs are still a headwind. Sequentially, they're a tailwind. But we're still, from a year-over-year basis, going through the period where costs had risen for some time. I think whether it be headwind or tailwind, I think the reality is that the market adjusts pretty rapidly to different changes in component costs and other short-term factors such as currency. So how much actually falls to the bottom line or how much we need to mitigate through additional productivity is very dependent upon the circumstances. In terms of the actual dollars that we're driving, we do remain on track to our productivity initiatives. It's an area where we'll continue to look to accelerate, candidly, given some of the Supplies challenges. But this is really in the DNA of HP, and I'm very confident in our ability to drive expense actions where we need to. 
Dion Weisler: And the only thing I would add to that is that we won't lead the market down on price. We obviously need to remain competitive in the marketplace, and we've been investing heavily in innovation and we believe our customers are valuing that innovation. And the demand signal for our products remains really strong. 
Operator: The next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: I just want to come back to the telemetry question and ask you if you could give us some idea where you are in the process of improving telemetry. So have you -- what kind of sample you have? So should we expect for you to continue to look at this and improve telemetry over time, and therefore, maybe come back to us and continue to adjust this inventory in the channel? Or is everything pretty much done now, and you wouldn't expect any changes? And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: I guess, for starters, the 4-box model historically has been a relatively good predictor. And I think we need to acknowledge that it is not perfect. There is data and science. There is also judgment and art to it. And to your question, we do need to get better with the telemetry data. And also, we've -- bundled it up to more analytics and business management system in general. And so what it really depends upon, I would sort of call it, a few dimensions, it's really the quantity, quality and speed of the telemetry. And from a quantity perspective, it's installing and shipping more of our installed base with the kind of newer, toner-based telemetrics such as the JetIntelligence. But it's also ensuring that we have access to that. And so increasingly, the penetration of our installed base and quantity is important, but also then the quality and speed in which we can analyze this information, apply more predictive BI analysis around it. So we are investing in this, and I would expect it to get better over time. But I'd -- to my opening comments, we have been pretty good at predicting with the 4-box model, and this is fine-tuning. 
Dion Weisler: But with all that said and done, I think it's also important to note something I mentioned earlier. We need to shift our business models in order to diversify our profit pools through services and securing a higher share of the supplies for these units. And so I am encouraged by the work that we're doing around Instant Ink and growing our installed base there as well as Managed Print Services. They're great examples of that model. And secondly, what I talked about is we've got to evolve our business to include products that generate a larger portion of the lifetime profitability at the time of purchase. 
Roderick Hall: Okay. And then I wanted -- on the follow-up, I just wanted to come back to the cash flow guidance. And I guess, do you see if there's any way -- I guess, the issue -- it makes sense to us that you could take working capital out. But this is a year when Personal Systems, we're not expecting a lot of growth, whereas we've had double-digit growth the last couple of years. So it seems like a tougher year to take working capital out. So I just wonder if there's anything else you can do to help us bridge back to the cash flow guidance or is it just a case that the cash flow guidance is a little bit more aggressive, considering the underlying fundamentals? 
Steven Fieler: I already highlighted the likely improvement in cash conversion cycle, and that obviously brings cash into the current year. When the Personal Systems business grows sequentially, even if it's small growth, it does pull cash into that period. And so while we are not anticipating the growth that we have seen in prior years, we do -- we are factoring in what we think the revenue and volume trajectory is of Personal Systems. And as long as that business has sequential growth, it is a cash generator. 
Operator: And our last questioner today will be Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. 
Ananda Baruah: Two if I could. Just going back to Supplies, Dion, is there any way for us to think about how you're thinking about what long-term, new normalized Supplies rates will be? And appreciate all the detail that you guys gave. But how should we be thinking about -- what's the best way for our models after '19 for us to be thinking about it, best you can tell right now? And then I have a follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Look. First, as Steve alluded to in our outlook, we've taken into account the approximately $100 million headwind from reducing inventory in the Supplies ecosystem. This is about a point of Supplies revenue, as Steve highlighted. And the remainder of the decline is the base is really based on factoring in the revised share and the pricing assumptions. And future outlook beyond '19 will depend upon a number of things including the progress we're making across each of our 4-box drivers and the pace of our business model evolution that I referred to at the last question. So at this time, just as we ordinarily do, we're not going to comment about future years. 
Steven Fieler: And maybe to provide a little additional context, I'll just sort of give an update of where we are on the 4-box. Enrique shared at SAM what we thought the various 4-box arrows looked like. And if Enrique were doing that today, given the changes we've seen driven by the commercial channel and evolving marketplace Dion described, first, we wouldn't expect any changes to installed base or usage. Where we would expect some change is in office. Whereas we have previously had an arrow going up of gaining share, given the new data, we'd actually expect share to be down to a lesser extent on office. Pricing, which was a down arrow, driven by the mix more to A3, we offer additional commentary that there would be pricing pressures, again as we described on the call. On home, almost all the boxes will remain the same except for share, given that a smaller portion of home does have toner-based products. And so the share we have previously had going up, it would still be going up but not as, I guess, strong of an arrow going up, as we had said at SAM. 
Ananda Baruah: That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a quick follow-up. Reiterating the EPS guidance, should we think any differently now about the potential for the upper half of the range? My personal -- I mean, our assumptions were that you actually had a good chance to beat the EPS guidance previously. So maybe there's still a good degree of confidence to land the upper half as well. But how should we think about that where it stands today? That's it for me. 
Steven Fieler: Well, as always, we view and take a very prudent view to our guidance, taking into account all of the puts and takes and risks and opportunities that we see, and we provide a range around it. I'm not going to comment specifically other than we have a range, and we've got confidence we can deliver within it. 
Dion Weisler: And we'd held that range. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. 
Dion Weisler: So thank you, everyone, for taking the time to join us. We remain confident in our business. We're reaffirming our full year EPS and full year cash flow guidance. We're relentless in both managing our costs and reinvesting to create long-term value. We know we have work to do to manage through the current dynamics, and that's exactly what we're going to do and what you should expect from us. We'll continue to play a long game. We'll execute to our strategy with rigor and focus on driving sustainable, long-term earnings and cash flow growth. Thanks very much. 
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q4  (2018-11-29 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Q4 2018 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] And please note that today's event is being recorded.
 And I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. 
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I'm Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc. And I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Steve Fieler, HP's Chief Financial Officer.
 Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available on our website shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. 
 We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations website at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. 
 For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials related to the forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on the information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HP's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, and other HP SEC filings.
 During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year-ago period. For financial information that isn't expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release for those reconciliations. 
 And now I will hand it over to Dion. 
Dion Weisler: Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us. It was great to see so many of you in New York for our Security Analyst Meeting. 
 As we close fiscal 2018, I'm proud of the results we delivered. It was a strong quarter and an exceptional year for HP. Our results demonstrate sustained operational performance, a disciplined investment framework and prudent cost management. Our core growth and future strategy is working, and we are well positioned for continued success across our categories and our regions. 
 For quarter 4, we delivered revenue of $15.4 billion, up 10%, with strong performance across regions and businesses; non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54, an increase of 23%; and strong free cash flow of approximately $800 million. For the full year, we grew 12%, adding over $6.4 billion of revenue. We grew non-GAAP earnings per share 22% to $2.02. We returned over $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we generated these results while continuing to invest in our strategic initiatives that are helping to strengthen our long-term competitiveness.
 We are consistently executing and winning with customers and partners while simultaneously fulfilling the commitments we made to our shareholders. With our winning portfolio and strong financials, we enter 2019 well positioned to compete across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D.
 Let's look at each of our segments. Personal Systems continued to deliver impressive profitable growth both in the fourth quarter and for the full year. In quarter 4, revenue and operating profit grew 11%. For the full year, revenue grew 13%, and operating profit grew even faster at 17%, adding more than $200 million to the bottom line. These results reinforce the strength of our market position as we focus on segmentation and delivering differentiated hardware, services and solutions.
 HP continues to be a leader in product design. At our analyst meeting, we introduced you to the stunning way of the Spectre Folio. The product is now hitting the market, receiving high praise for design, versatility and performance and driving renewed excitement in the PC category. We also recently launched 2 new Spectre x360s. The Spectre x360 13 delivers the world's longest battery life in a quad-core convertible, while Spectre x360 15 is the most powerful convertible we've ever created. 
 In Commercial, we unveiled the latest EliteBook, the world's smallest and lightest 14-inch business convertible and the first with gigabit class 4G LTE. In gaming, our OMEN PCs and displays powered the Overwatch World Cup where 24 countries battled for domination in front of nearly 10 million viewers. We also launched our latest OMEN desktop and our remote service called Game Stream that turns the OMEN PC into a cloud-based gaming server to enable experiences on the go. 
 And at Adobe MAX, we unveiled the new Z by HP workstation portfolio and announced a subscription-based hardware and services bundle specifically designed for elite creative professionals that combines powerful PCs, pro-grade displays, printers and accessories.
 As we innovate across our core, we are also continuing to accelerate our growth pillar with Device as a Service. 60% of IT organizations tell us their resources are increasingly taxed by device management, and 80% of their costs are coming after the PC is purchased. HP DaaS uses data and analytics to reduce costs and optimize the experience for IT and for end users. This quarter, the Technology Services Industry Association recognized HP DaaS with its STAR Award for Innovation in the standard managed service offering. This is one of the highest honors in the technology services industry.
 Like Personal Systems, Printing continues to drive profitable growth. Total Print revenue was up 9% in quarter 4 and 11% for the full year with growth in all regions and across hardware and supplies. Operating profit grew in both periods, adding $177 million to the bottom line for the full year. This consistent growth is yet another proof point of customer adoption of HP's innovative portfolio.
 Similar to the PC market, design is increasingly important for printers. Earlier in the quarter, we introduced the world's first smart home printer, HP Tango. Tango combines voice-activated and app-based printing with stunning design and convenience through our Instant Ink subscription program. We believe that Tango reinvents expectations for home printing, setting a new standard for print to fit seamlessly into consumers' lifestyles.
 We are also strengthening our leadership in the office space to drive new contractual and A3 growth opportunities. As we mark the anniversary of the S-Print acquisition, I am pleased with the progress we have made. We're one team focused on accelerating our penetration of this large addressable market. Earlier this month, we further accelerated our penetration of the copier market by completing the acquisition of Apogee, providing us with deep solutions and services expertise and a faster means to scale this business and tap into the profit pools that they offer.
 Lastly, we are focused on growing our Graphic Solutions business. Our strategy is to provide market-leading products and solutions that enable customization and personalization while reducing both inventory and turnaround time for print service providers. A key win that showcases the power of digital is ePac Flexible Packaging, an all-digital flexible packaging converter who purchased 20 additional HP Indigo digital presses to expand operations across the U.S.
 In 3D Printing, this quarter, we announced a new Metal Jet platform, bringing 3D mass production to the metals manufacturing industry for the first time. We're excited by the potential of this business and are working closely with automotive and industrial leaders like GKN, Volkswagen, Parmatech and many more. 
 We're especially encouraged by the volume of final part applications we are delivering across verticals, including the transportation, industrial and medical markets. At Formnext earlier this month, together with customers and partners, we showcased many of the new applications that have developed over the last year. One of these, BMW, is now manufacturing production parts for their cars on HP's Multi Jet Fusion. And FORECAST 3D now has 2 dozen Multi Jet Fusions deployed, operating around the clock to produce millions of final parts as their business grows.
 Looking at the year in total. We made great strides in 3D Printing. We expanded our portfolio, increased the number of customer applications tenfold, signed numerous strategic partnerships and generated multiunit customer orders. Multi Jet Fusion is now the most used industrial 3D printer in the world.
 Overall, I'm pleased with our company's 2018 results. We've done what we said we would do. We're growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow. We're delivering returns for our shareholders and investing in the future to create long-term value. 
 Looking ahead to 2019, as we said at the recent Security Analyst Meeting, we're monitoring several evolving market dynamics, including the global trade environment and currency volatility. In addition, our caution related to industry-wide CPU availability is now playing out and is constraining our growth. We're working diligently with our vendors and partners to reduce the short-term impacts on our customers in light of our ongoing strong demand. 
 Against this backdrop, we are focused on the things that made us successful in 2018, including innovation, execution and cost management. Short-term category headwinds do not diminish our excitement about this business and will not derail our long-term strategy. We will continue to play our own game, execute our strategy with rigor and aim for sustainable growth for the long term. And we will do so with the same sense of urgency and passion that has propelled our business forward since separation.
 With that, let me turn the call over to Steve to go through additional details. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Dion. We finished FY '18 with a strong Q4. Our results demonstrate the consistency of our strategy and focus on creating shareholder value for the long term. We delivered against our objectives with a focus on day-to-day execution while also investing in our strategic growth initiatives across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D to position the company for the future.
 For the full year, we grew revenue and operating profit dollars across both Printing and Personal Systems. We also delivered strong earnings per share growth, generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow and returned 83% of that free cash flow to shareholders, above the high end of our long-term range of 50% to 75%.
 Now let's look further into the results for the fourth quarter. Starting with the top line, net revenue was $15.4 billion, up 10% or up 9% in constant currency. Just as we've seen throughout the year, our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas grew 6%, EMEA was up 9% and APJ grew 17%. Gross margin was 17.6%, down 0.5 points, primarily resulting from the addition of S-Print. Sequentially, gross margin was down 0.8 points, driven by seasonal business mix and currency. 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 7%. This increase was driven by the addition of S-Print along with the incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $54 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.54, up $0.10 or 23% year-over-year with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. 
 Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share excludes amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, acquisition-related charges of $26 million and restructuring and other GAAP-only charges totaling $45 million, offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $54 million and related tax impact on all of these items. It also excludes a net gain of $597 million related to tax adjustments. The noncash gain was primarily related to a change in our ability to utilize certain deferred tax assets. As a result, Q4 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.91.
 At the segment level, Personal Systems net revenue remained strong, delivering $10.1 billion, up 11%. Results were again broad-based across customer segments, geographies and products, reflecting the strength of our product portfolio, go-to-market and supply chain. By customer segment, Consumer and Commercial revenue were both up 11%. By product category, revenue was up 14% for Notebooks, up 6% for Desktops and up 10% for Workstations. 
 In calendar quarter 3, our market share was 22.5% as we continued to execute our strategy and focus on profitable growth. Our performance was driven by strong execution as we managed a dynamic market environment and the initial signs of CPU shortages, which we expect will constrain our growth in the first half of 2019.
 Personal Systems continued to grow operating profit, up $37 million versus last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher volume and better ASPs, partially offset by higher commodities and logistics costs and the initial impact of tariffs in the U.S. Operating margin was 3.8%, flat year-over-year.
 In Printing, revenue was $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 9%. We have made steady progress in the performance of the business and remain focused on managing our core businesses of building for the future across our strategic growth initiatives.
 Total hardware units were up 11% with Consumer units up 3% and Commercial units up 85%, including S-Print. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to place NPV positive units when we see them. In calendar quarter 3, overall Print unit share was 42%.
 Q4 Supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 7%. The Supplies mix of total Print revenue was 64%, down year-over-year and sequentially. We continue to operate below our ceilings for Supplies channel inventory. For the full year, Supplies revenue grew in line with our outlook, inclusive of the acquired S-Print supply stream and installed base which, as we described at SAM, we expect to continue to decline. 
 Printing operating profit grew $46 million versus last year and operating margin was 16.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, up 0.1 points sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were the addition of S-Print and the strong unit placements as well as investments in growth and future initiatives, including A3 and 3D Printing, partially offset by favorable currency.
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q4 cash flow from operations was $968 million, and free cash flow was $843 million. For the full year, we delivered free cash flow of $4.2 billion, above our previously provided guidance of at least $3.7 billion. 
 Q4 free cash flow includes both the timing benefit of higher Personal Systems volume and a better year-end cash conversion cycle of minus 32 days. This was an improvement versus our prior outlook of minus 29 to minus 30 days, driven by lower days of inventory. Sequentially, cash conversion cycle weakened 2 days, in line with typical seasonality with a 3-day decrease in days payable outstanding; a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding, driven by revenue linearity; and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory, largely a result of a decrease in strategic purchases.
 We returned $598 million to shareholders through share repurchases and $219 million via cash dividends in Q4. For the full year, we returned $3.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends or 83% of free cash flow.
 Looking forward to FY '19, keep the following in mind related to our overall financial outlook: Based on recent moves in the U.S. dollar, we are expecting increased headwind from currency compared to the end of September rates we used in the outlook we provided at SAM. Our plans to mitigate previously announced and implemented China-U.S. tariffs are on track. As described at SAM, we expect the headwind to be larger in the short term and reduced throughout the year. We have not considered any impact from unannounced tariffs or any significant demand changes that may result from an increase in geopolitical uncertainties.
 Specific to Personal Systems, we expect CPU supply constraints through the first half of 2019. Regarding the overall basket of components and logistics, we expect the cost to improve compared to Q4 levels. This should offset some of the increased currency headwind, assuming the market is not incrementally more competitive. 
 In Printing, we continue to expect overall Supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year. And we are including the full year expected impact from the Apogee acquisition. In addition, for the full year, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in FY '19.
 Taking these considerations into account, we are providing the following outlook: Q1 '19 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.53, Q1 '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.49. We are maintaining our full year fiscal 2019 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.22 and full year fiscal '19 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.04 to $2.14, and we expect to return approximately 75% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over the course of the full year.
 And now let's open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Amit Daryanani: Two questions from me. I guess, maybe the first one, Dion, you mentioned about CPU shortages impacting your growth in the quarter you're in. Can you just touch on how much revenues do you think you left on the table due to these issues? And as you think about the first half, is the impact sort of start to diminish in Q1 and Q2? Or does it actually magnify more so which is on Q4? 
Dion Weisler: Okay. Thanks, Amit. So you'll recall at the Security Analyst Meeting that we said we were cautious for the first half of 2019 with regards to CPU shortages. And that's exactly what's playing out. Intel stated again this week that shortages are constraining the customers' growth across their ecosystem, and we're seeing that impact across multiple core families of processes and chipsets that have an effect or an impact, both the high end and the low end of the range. We also said at SAM that we expect bigger impact in the first half of 2019 with more variability around revenue, depending on the ability to secure supply in order to meet our robust demand. The demand signal for our products is and remains really strong even through the market supply constraints that we're seeing. And while the shortages are expected to put a strain on the industry and the ecosystem, this is just something that we have to work through with our supplies, our partners and our customers in the short term. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. The one thing I'd add there, as Dion said, our caution is definitely playing out, and it's really not dramatically different than our views at the Security Analyst Meeting in totality but probably expected more of an impact in Q4 and so would see a larger impact in Q1 than we saw in Q4. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And Steve, let me just follow up. You had very impressive free cash flow in fiscal '18 at $4.2 billion. As I think about the fiscal '19 guide of $3.7 billion, and I think you had assumed, at least at the Analyst Day, that cash conversion cycle would improve by a couple of days in '19 versus '18, can you just help me understand what are the couple of levers or headwinds you have that drags down fiscal -- free cash flow down in fiscal '19? Or are we just being conservative over here? 
Steven Fieler: Yes, so maybe I'll just sort of describe then some of the assumptions. We did have a strong finish to fiscal '18, in Q4 specifically. And as a reminder, we do expect that -- our free cash flow to grow in line with earnings over time. But as we saw for the full year and again in Q4, we had stronger Personal Systems volume, and we did have an improving cash conversion cycle. Personal Systems volume, for example, grew 7% sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and our cash conversion cycle was minus 32 days. That was better than our outlook for the year. And how that then bridges to '19, I do remain confident in delivering at least $3.7 billion for the full year. However, taking into account our strong FY '18 results did pull in some upside from '19. And also, given some of the comments we just made on the constraints on CPUs, I would expect that, in the first half, some of the softening of the Personal Systems revenue and constraints, we'd expect a weaker first half free cash flow just given the negative working capital on the Personal Systems business. So the assumptions that I discussed at SAM hold. I'd just add, we have factored in all of the respective segment-level kind of business volume, including the implied slower growth in Personal Systems. And we've also seen additional opportunities to improve cash conversion cycle beyond the minus 32 days, primarily around DPO. And finally, we do expect now to have other cash flow favorability in '19, including timing of certain tax and other cash items. So altogether, our bottoms of outlook gives us confidence of maintaining at least $3.7 billion for the full year. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 
Wamsi Mohan: Dion, just a clarification on your answer to the prior question. You said you are seeing constraints, CPU constraints, both at the high end and the low end of the range. I was wondering if you could maybe give us some color that could help us triangulate, like, is the -- either in terms of units or in terms of revenue impact in the first half of the year that you would be seeing from these CPU shortages that can help us like think through the quantification of that? And I have a follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Yes, I would say it actually affects both units as well as revenue. And I believe that the shortages, certainly, what we are seeing today exist both at the low end of the range as well as the high end of the range. So there is a mix. And the mix is still moving around as Intel is working furiously to get capacity up to support demand. So it is -- it's moving around, but I expect that we will see it both in terms of units and in revenue. 
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. And as a follow-up, are you seeing any evidence of the channel behaving differently in terms of maybe building some inventory ahead of these tariffs? And what are you thinking about from a broader supply chain standpoint, if there are incremental tariffs that are not included in your guidance, as those get put on. What are some of the levers that you can use? Are you thinking about moving production and working with your ODM partners to do incrementally more outside of China? If you could give some color there, that'd be great. 
Dion Weisler: Sure. So in terms of -- so the first part of your question there was around inventory levels and partner behavior and customer behavior. What I would say is our demand signal is really strong. It's not perfectly measurable exactly how much of that is because of a well-understood reality of the shortages. We're looking at our sellout data very closely. And that gives us a signal as what are actually going into end customers' hands, and that remains broadly strong. And so I think whilst -- generally, when this happens in the industry, there is a tendency for a lot of order load to come into the system. We're certainly seeing that. But I would say, generally speaking, as you're seeing through the course of 2018, demand has been strong for our products off the back of really strong innovation. Steve, you might tackle the first part of the tariff question, and I'm happy to comment as well. 
Steven Fieler: Yes, I mean it's somewhat kind of what I commented earlier. I mean, at this point, we have factored in to our guidance all of the known tariffs. This includes the tariffs that were announced, implemented in the September period. We have not included any incremental unannounced tariffs into our guide, and we have multiple levers that we're implementing to mitigate the tariffs. There's a variety of strategies in place. But at this point, there's no reason for us to put into any sort of guidance what is an unknown. So we're just sticking with what we know and the certainties around that. 
Dion Weisler: And I think we've been pretty consistent about that. We said we'd continue to monitor the evolving tariff situation just as all of you are doing as well, I'm sure. We've said it before, we don't speculate or chase ghosts. We have, as Steve mentioned, a number of levers available to us should additional tariffs come into place. The tariffs that we know about, the first tranche and the second tranche, have been fully factored into the guide that Steve provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. And we'll continue to work to optimize all of our operations to deal with the industry dynamics that are just part of operating this business. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. I just wanted to follow up on some of the previous commentary. I was at the Securities Analyst Meeting, and my sense was that the message around CPU availability was much softer than it was on this call. I think the notion was we face these. We can manage around it. There will be some impact, but we can manage it. And it feels like, incrementally, that's become a bigger issue than you had thought. And kudos to you that you can still manage around it and uphold your guidance. But I just wanted to be clear about whether this is incrementally tougher than you thought a month ago. And ultimately, what has driven it? Is it stronger-than-expected demand or the relative availability to you, as one of the biggest players, is not as strong as you thought? And I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I think, Toni, I think a part of your question sort of answers it, which is we are maintaining our full year guidance and our Q1 outlook of $0.50, $0.53. It does incorporate all of the known risk and opportunities, including the risks around the CPU constraints. At SAM, we did talk about the caution, and that caution is clearly playing out. But again, it is all factored into our guidance. And I'd say, sort of directionally speaking, it's not dramatically different than what we provided from caution. It is just now real and playing out. 
Dion Weisler: And that demand still remains strong as it has been all throughout 2018. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just on the tariff question. You have had some tariffs impact principally your desktop machines and your Workstations. I think in response to that, there's been selective price increases. I did notice your desktop growth rate was a little bit lower in the quarter than your notebook growth rate. So I'm wondering if you can comment on whether you've seen any elasticity associated with price changes from tariffs. And then secondly, if we were to see the $200 billion in tariffs, would that not apply to essentially all of your notebook business and the vast majority of your Printing business? Or am I misguided in that assertion? 
Steven Fieler: Yes, I mean taking a step back on Q4, the overall tariffs that have been announced, implemented through September, I'd say, didn't have material impact on the company. But to your question, they did have impact in our Personal Systems business and in desktop. And you saw that, really, it's a margin headwind that we help mitigate through other factors. And we are working through a variety of mitigation items on the tariffs. Pricing could indeed be one of the ways we mitigate, but there's others ways to do it as well. Maybe, Dion, if you want to talk about the broader unknowns, but there's not a whole lot to say. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. So I think, Toni, it's important to understand how we think about pricing in all of our markets. We have a pretty definitive process and strategy that looks at our products' performance adjusted based on the various differences from one SKU to another SKU, what we call PFE. And we set a strategy market by market, and we need to ensure that we remain competitive. So I would say that we're obviously watching our pricing very carefully. We're looking at our competitors' pricing very carefully. We tend not to lead the market down on price. And sometimes, in many cases, we're the first to take up pricing. But having said that, I think Steve's quite right. We've got many levers available to us, and we're exercising all of them. As it sort of relates to the second part of the question, which was around... 
Steven Fieler: Any unknowns. 
Dion Weisler: Any unknowns. We just don't chase ghosts, Toni. We don't know what the rates would be. If there were tariffs, we don't know to what extend -- extent it would include listed items. Would it be everything? Would it be partial? So rather than speculating on that, when they become announced, we put our mitigation plans into place. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I was hoping you could provide some more insight into the competitive environment within Printing. Xerox and Lexmark have both had some pretty significant changes in senior leadership. Ricoh, I think, is a little more focused on profit. So I'm curious how you're seeing some of your competitors react to the industry. 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I would say the Printing market is still -- there's many players. There's upwards of over a dozen players in the printing market. And in an overall market that's relatively flat, generally, what happens in that environment is, where you don't have the scale, it becomes more difficult to compete. Some of our competitors are a little distracted. Others are focused. We look at all of our competitors, but ultimately, we're playing our game. We have an incredible portfolio of products, a very clear strategy, both transactionally as well as the work we're doing in our contractual space. Our security messages are really resonating with our customers. It's on every C-level executives' mind, and we have the most secure printers on the planet. Our Managed Print Services business continues to be an area of focus for us. The integration of Samsung's business has just gone through its first-year anniversary, and I'm really pleased with how we've integrated that company and how we're making progress against our goals in the A3 contractual space. So all in all, we're playing our game, and we're very focused on that. And we'll continue to be competitive in the marketplace. 
Shannon Cross: And then with regard to 3D Printing, you had a successful show, I think, at Formnext. Clearly, there have been some product launches during the past year and then coming up in calendar 2019. What are you hearing from end markets? Do you feel like you're getting to a point where there's an inflection in demand within 3D Printing? Where are the areas that you're seeing the most growth and the most interest and sort of as you look to next year? 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I'm really excited by the 3D Printing businesses. It's an incredible business. And as we talked about in the Securities Analyst Meeting, it sits on our third time horizon of the future, and it's not something that we expect will have a material impact for us in 2019. But over time, in my mind, it's incredibly clear. It's not a question of if the Fourth Industrial Revolution will happen, it's when. And we are certainly positioning ourselves to be in pole position when that happens. We've had a great 3 years since we announced the creation of the business, and we introduced our first technology. We've done exactly what we said we would do. We said we would lay markers for all of you because we don't talk about the financials specifically, but they would be very specific markers and milestones by which you could hold us accountable to. And I think we've delivered on all of those. The introduction of the 3D printer for the plastics market. We've become the #1 player for production in a very short period of time. We've expanded our portfolio in line with our expectations. We have, inside the first product that we released, the follow-on product, the 4210, which really improves productivity of core plastics. We introduced color with the 3M 500 Series, which will begin generating revenue in 2019. We introduced metals last quarter. Customers will begin using our metal production service with our partners in 2019. We've added new materials. We started with PA 12 plastic. We then moved to glass beads. We've got PA 11 and TPU coming very soon and metal powders with GKN, which is really focused in the automotive industry. So with the partnerships that we've created and the ecosystem we're building, we're right on track to how we think we maintain this market leadership as the industry is set to disrupt this $12 trillion industry. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi Investment Research. 
Jim Suva: Kind of a housekeeping question then more of a strategy question. The housekeeping question is on your EPS guidance that you gave last month, am I correct that, that included like $0.01 or $0.02 from Apogee? And is that still intact? Or is that incrementally changing at all? That's the housekeeping item. Then strategically, when we think about if memory prices come lower because the past, say, 12 to 18 months, you've been adjusting prices higher, are you going to be adjusting prices actively lower? Are you looking to harvest some of that profitability or give some of it back because it looks like you've been gaining share still while increasing pricing? So I'm just kind of wondering about the strategy of how we should think about those component costs in your go-to-market strategy. 
Steven Fieler: So Jim, on the housekeeping topic, the guide provided today does include Apogee, and at the Securities Analyst Meeting, it did not. So we have -- just getting started with the year and have -- the range captures kind of all the known risk and opportunities. But I have included Apogee in the guide today. 
Dion Weisler: And as it relates to the sort of second part of the question, whilst it's true memory is certainly trending lower, overall, some of that is offset with currency headwinds with the stronger U.S. dollar that we are seeing. But again, we use this mechanism of price function value as we look at all of our competitors. We don't lead the market down on price. We want to ensure that we remain competitive in the marketplace. We are vigilant always on cost management across the ecosystem. And we're just looking to segment the markets, find the profitable areas of growth in the business and target profitable growth. We don't chase share for share's sake. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be John Roy with UBS. 
John Roy: So you are able to pretty much hit your Print margin number for the quarter. Can you give us the puts and takes that would make that move around for the rest of fiscal '19? And what are you thinking essentially all-in when you sum it all together where you might come out for '19? 
Steven Fieler: Well, we're pleased with the profit we drove in Print in Q4. We've been focused on driving incremental operating profit dollars consistent with our strategy, and we grew $46 million year-over-year and, for the full year, $177 million. And so we'll continue to focus on our strategy. That includes investing in our business, in A3 and the opportunities to disrupt that market and also 3D Printing. We're also going to continue to place units where we see NPV positive opportunities to do so. So as we're shifting the business over time to more services and contractual, we're going to operate that business with an operating margin target in the next 3 years of at least 16%. And we'll continue to drive Supplies to flat to slightly up this year. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. 
Paul Coster: I'm just wondering if the trade conflict that seems to be happening with China, whether that has any impact on your ability to go into the PC end market there, which I know, in the past, you've described as being an area where you're underindexed at the moment, so a growth opportunity. 
Dion Weisler: Look, China has been and continues to be a very strategically important market for us. We have a very strong brand in the country. We've been present for a very long time. We obviously continue to assess the situation and the potential impact on our business and our plans that we may or may not need to make as a result. But again, we're not chasing ghosts, but we're also not sticking our heads in the sand either. It's an important market and will remain so. 
Paul Coster: Okay. One quick follow-up. The printer market share seems to bounce around a little bit. It's up year-on-year but only 200 basis points, which is a little less market share gain than the prior quarter. Probably doesn't mean much is my guess, but I'm just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on whether there's any segments in which you think you're outperforming strongly or struggling a little bit. 
Steven Fieler: Yes, I mean, we concur. I mean, I think the market in the long term has some ups and downs and pockets of growth. And in any particular quarter, share shifts will occur. For us, we're going to remain very disciplined on pursuing profitable share. It's what we did in the last quarter, and you see it in the calendar quarter 3. Where there's some pockets of the overall market, we're choosing not to compete. And we see that primarily on the low-end consumer. But overall, pleased with the performance, growing A3 and on the office more broadly. But I think to your question, I mean, there'll be puts and takes every quarter, but we'll be very disciplined on ensuring we go after the profitable growth. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: So I guess, my first question is on the 0.8% move in gross margins. You'd said it was seasonality and FX. I just wonder if you might be able to quantify how much of that was FX on the sequential moves. And then I also wanted to see if you could update us on the A3 market share. You gave it last quarter, I believe, and you've got this target of 12%, so just curious how that progressed in the quarter. 
Steven Fieler: So I'll take the first one. The largest driver really was due to seasonality and a higher Personal Systems mix. Personal Systems again sequentially grew 7%. Print sequentially grew 2%. So that's the largest driver. Incremental to that, to your question, we did have some FX headwinds quarter-to-quarter. We did also have the initial impact of the tariffs on the Personal Systems side. But I would say, the short response is, the primary driver is really on the Personal Systems mix quarter-to-quarter. 
Dion Weisler: And as it relates to A3 share, Rod, we grew share year-over-year calendar quarter 3 by 0.8 points. And I remain really excited about the future opportunities and really encouraged by the progress of our A3 business since we started. We continue to introduce new products and solutions to complement an already very robust portfolio. We continue to sign our premier partners around the world, which is critical to scaling the business. We continue to focus on differentiators that really matter for our customers in areas like security and print quality. And as a reminder, and as we've said in the past, we don't expect the sequential growth to happen every single quarter. We remain on track to achieve our 12% market share by the end of calendar 2020. That's the marker, the longer-term marker we put in the ground. And that's what you can expect to see from us. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: I want to go back on the pricing discussion on the PC category. You guys have had several quarters now where pricing has been up solidly. And given the variables at play, I guess, the first question on that is, oftentimes in the past, HP has had the advantage of gaining share in the face of component supply constraints, such as the CPU situation, so I'm curious of how you plan to react and potentially if you see opportunity to take incremental share on that. And then second to that, on the component pricing dynamic, I'm curious of how much of the past couple of quarters in terms of pricing has been driven by mix versus, say, the pass-through of component pricing? 
Steven Fieler: So I'll take a crack at it. So on the last piece first. So what we saw in Q4, roughly speaking, about a 5-point ASP increase when you look at the revenue versus units. Just under 1/4 of that is the structural improvements we're making in mix. And the remainder was sort of the broader pricing category where we're factoring in the competitive situation, currency, commodities, et cetera. On the first part, I mean our strategy continues to be to kind of profitably grow share. And we see the current situation no different than we see it at any market situation where we like our product portfolio. We like our lineup. We like our ability to compete and win in the marketplace. And so just like we do in any market situation, our goals are go out there and to gain profitable share. 
Dion Weisler: The only thing I would add to that is you should expect to continue to see us focused on mix shift towards more profitable parts of the market as we do our segmentation. We've mentioned on previous calls premium and gaming. The Spectre Folio that we showed at the Security Analyst Meeting is an incredible piece of art and innovation, the intersection between the 2. And it's been really well received by our customers. So customers are looking for premium devices. Our gaming franchise continues to grow. We remain excited about that. And we're focused on other more profitable areas of the Personal Systems category. And you heard Alex say at the Security Analyst Meeting, there's displays and accessories and services where, traditionally, we've been underindexed, where we have a lot of focus as well as new growth opportunities with Device as a Service. 
Operator: And the next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. 
Steven Milunovich: I believe that you're the largest user of AMD processors among the PC vendors. Is that the case? And does that relationship help you offset the Intel issues? 
Dion Weisler: So that's probably a better question for AMD to ask them if we're the largest or not. But I would say that we have had a very long partnership and a very good partnership with AMD for many years. They're part of our multisource strategy, and we have a variety of tremendous AMD offerings in our portfolios. Customers make decisions. They weigh price and performance and functionality when making purchasing decisions. And there are definitely segments and geographies where AMD offerings are an attractive alternative. 
Steven Milunovich: And on the A3 business, you've talked about this past year was a placement year of hardware and then, down the road, you would begin to benefit from the associated supplies and services. Do we get much of that benefit in fiscal '19? Or do you need the installed base to get larger, so it's more of a fiscal '20 occurrence? 
Steven Fieler: We’ll start to get some benefit clearly in '19, but it does take time to get that installed base built. So we certainly see the greater upside in FY '20 and years beyond. 
Dion Weisler: And with that, I think we are out of time. Let me close by thanking you all for all of your attendance over the course of this year. It's been a very strong year for us this year in 2018. We've done what we said we would do. I'm very proud of that. As we look into and look ahead to 2019, we remain very focused on the things that have made us successful since separation. We're focused on innovation. We're focused on execution. We're focused on relentless cost management. We have very strong financials, the best portfolio, I think, we've ever had. We have solid opportunities across Personal Systems, Printing and 3D in core growth in future. We'll continue to play our own game, execute against our strategy with rigor and aim for sustainable growth for the long term.
 With that, I wish you all happy holidays. Thanks very much for joining us. 
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.

Dion Weisler: Thanks, Beth. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Quarter 3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth with consistent and balanced performance across businesses and regions. As a company, we're delivering what we said we would do and optimizing the business to consistently deliver long-term sustainable and profitable growth.
 Q3 was impressive. Specifically, we delivered 12% revenue growth, adding $1.5 billion to the top line, and we increased non-GAAP earnings per share 21% to $0.52. And we delivered $1.4 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and returned $900 million to shareholders, bringing the total return of cash to shareholders so far this year to $2.6 billion.
 Each quarter is an opportunity for us to strike the right balance in how we plan, innovate and deliver operational performance regardless of market conditions, external factors and competitor movements. We are continuing to grow in our core with profitable share, advance our position in our growth segments and invest in future categories where we can disrupt with innovation and new business models. And just as importantly, we're laser-focused on increasing productivity and taking cost out of the business.
 As I've been clear about, our goal is to consistently deliver on our financial commitments while executing our strategic framework. We do this by playing our own game and winning the right way and by delivering products and services that are consistently engineered to amaze our partners and customers.
 Now let me take you through what we're seeing across the business. First, let's start with Personal Systems, where profitable growth continues to be our priority. It was another strong quarter with operating profit dollars, margins and revenue each growing sequentially and versus the prior year. HP continued to outperform the PC market in the second calendar quarter, growing share with broad-based growth across regions and product categories. While we're proud of these results and the team's efforts, share gains continue to be an outcome of our innovation for customers and not an objective of our business. We are delivering differentiated products and experiences to the market. We continue to reinvent our Personal Systems business and portfolio with the most secure and manageable PCs. In May, we unveiled a bold new lineup of premium notebooks, desktops and displays across our Elite and ENVY portfolios, including the world's smallest business convertible and the first detachable with integrated privacy screen.
 The team is leveraging HP's design and engineering leadership to deliver the ultimate combination of style, performance and versatility, what I like to call our sprinkles of magic. Our premium pipeline remains strong, and we're excited about a range of new products that will be hitting the market as we head into the holiday season. Similarly, in vertical markets, we continue to drive innovation and growth.
 In gaming, we enhanced our OMEN brand with a new portfolio of industry-leading accessories. Our newest OMEN laptop that launched in May at a gaming festival in Beijing sold out in just 20 minutes on JD.com. And OMEN was front and center at last month's Overwatch League Grand Finals that attracted more than 10 million viewers across streaming platforms.
 In retail, we introduced the new HP Engage retail point-of-sale portfolio, providing retailers with a versatile platform with layers of security to enable seamless engagement from the moment consumers enter a store until the time they check out. Our new retail solutions will also be available through the HP Device-as-a-Service offering.
 Just like Personal Systems, the Print business continues to make steady progress and deliver profitable growth. Total Print revenue was up an impressive 11% with growth in all regions and across Commercial hardware, Consumer hardware and Supplies. Print units were up 12%, and the overall print hardware market grew 1% in the second calendar quarter, supporting our confidence in the health of the Printing business for the long term.
 The Print team not only continues to execute our strategy and innovate across the portfolio but is making progress in strategically shifting towards contractual business models. Over the past few quarters, we've expanded upon our acquisition of Samsung's printer business and extended our A3 product portfolio to offer customers affordable color printing while delivering best-in-class performance and security.
 We are building on this foundation of strong technology with differentiated solutions to expand Managed Print Services and with the investments in our direct and indirect go-to-market capabilities, including the selective acquisition of office equipment dealers or OEDs, that provide access to increased profit pools from higher-margin services.  Earlier this month, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Apogee Corporation. Apogee is Europe's largest independent provider of print and document services and has a proven track record and deep capabilities in contractual sales. This is an important next step in our strategy to accelerate growth in the contractual office print market. Following the announcement of the transaction, I met with a number of our large partners who understand that scaling our contractual business faster benefits both HP and our partners to grow in the industry shift to contractual.
 Looking at our other strategic initiatives. In graphics, we again grew revenue and are driving market-leading innovation. This quarter, we unveiled the new DesignJet Z large format photo printers that offer amazing image quality and production efficiency. We also announced that R.R. Donnelley is adding the new HP Indigo presses to their fleet to help increase their capacity and enhance their ability to deliver high-quality print products to their customers.
 Shifting to the 3D Printing business, we are pleased with our progress in accelerating 3D printing for production manufacturing. We drove installations with industrial-grade customers, including the new 3D printing center in China, the world's largest manufacturing market. We are encouraged by the increasingly wide array of final part applications across sectors, including the industrial, consumer, auto and health care markets. We're seeing north of 50% of the parts produced on our systems are for final production.
 This quarter, we also furthered our channel presence and expanded our strategic partnership with Siemens, providing design software support for our full-color platform. Ensuring the world's industrial product engineers have integrated design tools for 3D production is a critical enabler for market expansion. We are still in the very early stages of this business but remain excited and optimistic with our ability to disrupt the $12 trillion global manufacturing market.
 Before I move off 3D Printing, I'd like to share some additional news with you. After 37 years at HP, Stephen Nigro, President of our 3D Printing business, has made the decision to retire in early 2019. During the past 3 decades, Stephen has had a tremendous career from pioneering our first Inkjet printers to leading teams across the U.S. and Asia to most recently turning a nascent 3D printing opportunity into a business that has become the #1 commercial-grade plastics 3D printing vendor less than 2 years after product launch. Our differentiated 3D printing technology and leadership will help enable HP to accelerate the Fourth Industrial Revolution. I couldn't be more thankful for Steve's leadership, guidance and commitment to HP.
 One of the things we pride ourselves on is the depth and breadth of our bench and our rigorous succession planning. I am super excited that Christoph Schell, our current President of the Americas region, will transition to become President of 3D Printing, where he and the team will focus on the next phase of scaling our 3D Printing business. Christoph just celebrated his 20th year anniversary at HP, and he's a rigorous and balanced operational leader with outstanding experience transitioning customers and partners into new service-led business models. Under his leadership, our Americas region has delivered impressive and consistent growth. Christoph has a passion for 3D Printing and has played a key role in our earliest 3D Printing wins and partnerships. I have great confidence in his leadership of this important business. We expect the transition to be seamless and look forward to having you all meet Christoph at our Security Analyst Meeting in New York on October 3. Christoph's role is effective November 1.
 In summary, Q3 was another strong quarter of profitable growth with balanced growth across businesses and regions. We are pleased with the success in the business.
 Looking ahead to Q4, we are monitoring several evolving market dynamics, including the global trade environment, currency volatility and industry component availability. That said, one of the strengths we've consistently demonstrated is our ability to navigate the impact of these challenges and leverage our innovation and scale to create advantage and drive sustained performance. We are executing and meeting our commitments, and I'm confident in the team's ability to continue doing exactly this.
 With that, I'll hand it over to Steve to cover our financial results in more detail and share our financial outlook. 
Steven Fieler: Thanks, Dion. Q3 was another quarter where we delivered strong results consistent with our strategy and furthering our goal of creating long-term shareholder value. Having met recently with a large number of employees, customers and partners, it's clear that this company remains focused on executing each quarter while also positioning the company for the future. And our results demonstrate this balance of delivering in the near term while investing in growth and leading through an increasingly dynamic environment.
 We continue to post growth in revenue and operating profit dollars across both segments and earnings per share. We also generated strong free cash flow in the quarter and are on track to return capital to shareholders above the high end of our range of 50% to 75%. Similar to prior quarters, I'll walk through our financial details: first, the P&L, including the segments; then the balance sheet; cash flow and capital return; and finally, guidance.
 Starting at the top line, net revenue was $14.6 billion, up 12% or up 9% in constant currency. Our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, in constant currency, Americas grew 6%. EMEA was up 10%, and APJ grew 13%. Gross margin was 18.4%, down 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily resulting from the addition of S-Print. Sequentially, gross margin was down 90 basis points, driven by seasonal mix.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 15%. This increase, which is similar to the growth in prior periods, was driven by the addition of S-Print along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 2%. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $59 million for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.52, up $0.09 or 21% year-over-year with a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares.
 Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes amortization and tangible assets of $20 million, acquisition-related charges of $10 million and other GAAP-only charges totaling $11 million, offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $56 million and related tax impact on all of these items. As a result, Q3 GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.54. 
 At the  segment level, Personal Systems net revenue remained strong, delivering $9.4 billion, up 12%. Results continue to be broad-based across customer segments, geographies and products, reflecting the strength of our supply chain, go to market and innovative product portfolio.
 By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 10% and Commercial revenue was up 13%. By product category, revenue was up 13% for Notebooks, up 12% for Desktops and up 11% for Workstations.
 In calendar Quarter 2, we saw opportunity for profitable growth and we took advantage. We outgrew the market by 5.4 points and earned market share of 24%, doing so while managing cost headwinds and investing in innovation.
 Personal Systems continue to grow operating profit, up $52 million versus last year. We also improved operating margin to 3.9%, up 20 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially. The increase was primarily driven by higher ASPs due to both favorable currency and improved mix, partially offset by higher commodity and logistics costs.
 In Printing, revenue was $5.2 billion in the quarter, up 11%. We have made steady progress in the performance of the business and remain focused on managing the portfolio across the core growth and future product categories. Total hardware units were up 12%, with Consumer units up 2% and Commercial units up 91%, including S-Print, and up 3% sequentially. In calendar Quarter 2, overall Print unit share was 43%, up 1 point year-over-year. We continue to take advantage of opportunities to place units when we see them.
 Q3 Supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 8% or 6% in constant currency. The Supplies mix of total Print revenue was 66%, down year-over-year and nearly flat sequentially. And we continue to operate below our ceilings for Supplies channel inventory.
 Print operating profit grew $25 million year-over-year, and operating margin was 16%, down 1.3 points year-over-year and flat sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were the addition of S-Print and the strong unit placements and investments in growth and future initiatives, including A3 and 3D printing.  Additionally, as expected, we experienced increased raw material cost in the quarter, which should remain elevated in Q4.
 We continue to see momentum in our contractual offerings. Our recent announcement to acquire Apogee builds on our long-term contractual strategy by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and accelerates the deployment of our technology into the growing contractual market. We expect the transaction to close by the end of the calendar year 2018 pending regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. We expect the deal to be accretive by approximately $0.01 on a non-GAAP basis in the first full year after close.
 Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion and free cash flow was $1.4 billion. Cash conversion cycle improved 4 days sequentially to minus 34 days, driven by a 4-day increase in days payable outstanding, a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding offset by a 2-day increase in days of inventory. Increases in days of inventory and days payable outstanding are largely a result of leveraging our balance sheet and normal seasonality.
 We had capital returns of $696 million in share repurchases and $223 million in cash dividends in Q3. For the full year, it is now more likely that we will deliver returns above the high end of our FY '18 outlook of 50% to 75% of free cash flow.
 Looking forward to Q4, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we expect that the overall basket of components and logistics costs will remain stable to Q3 levels. In Printing, we expect strong unit placements, which should continue to push the hardware revenue mix higher. We've recently seen increased currency volatility, and we'll work to mitigate the impact via prior hedges and potential pricing actions, considering the full spectrum of market and demand dynamics.
 For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives. We'll also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. Finally, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate, which is based on our long-term non-GAAP financial projection, to be 16% in Q4.
 With all that in mind, we expect Q4 '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.52 to $0.55. Q4 '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.48 to $0.51. We are raising our full year fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2 to $2.03 and our full year fiscal '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.82 to $2.85. I look forward to engaging directly with many of you at the upcoming conferences and meetings as well as at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting on October 3.
 With that, let's open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: What was your market share in A3 during the quarter? And how are you thinking about the acquisition of Apogee and potentially other acquisitions in the distribution space in terms of what that could add to your A3 market share over time? And then I have a follow up on inventory. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Katy, and thanks for the question. Specifically, we grew share 2 points in the quarter to 9.1% in calendar Quarter 2., and we remain excited about our future opportunities. While I'm pleased with that performance and I'm encouraged by our progress that our team is making around our A3 business, we don't expect that kind of growth each quarter. We're -- as I'd like to always remind everybody, we're building a business for the long term. We're playing our own game. Our focus, as in all our areas of our business, is on profitable gains over time. We remain on track to achieve the 12% market share by the end of calendar 2020, and that guidance remains intact. As it relates to Apogee, our goal of 12% worldwide market share by the end of calendar 2020 is not materially impacted by this acquisition given its size relative to the worldwide total available market of A3. That being said, the Apogee transaction is all about giving access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and the acceleration of the deployment of our -- of what we assure is superior technology into the growing contractual spaces, especially amongst SMBs. 
Kathryn Huberty: And then... 
Steven Fieler: Katy, could I have the opportunity even... 
Kathryn Huberty: Yes, sure. 
Steven Fieler: In my prior role as Treasurer to be part of the -- leading the initial negotiation with Apogee, it really is about services capabilities. They've got a great leadership team and winning in their market. We definitely took a disciplined approach for that particular deal as we would for any other deal in that space and believe we've got a great opportunity to create shareholder value. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the $0.01 accretion, but we also like the margin profile. There have been double-digit EBITDA margins for some time, and they play in a fast kind of growing part of the contractual TAM. So we think we've got the opportunity to generate synergies over time with this deal. They've been very successful both organically and inorganically and really give us the opportunity to place more units over time as well as to leverage the platform [ they ] build for Device as a Service and other services capabilities we're building internally. 
Kathryn Huberty: And Steve, maybe a follow up for you. I was surprised to see inventory up as much as it was sequentially just given that you made some pretty big pre-buys over the last couple of years to deal with the tighter memory environment. That's now loosening. And so what's driving the inventory higher at the moment? 
Steven Fieler: Our inventory was up $500 million quarter-to-quarter, up 2 days. We feel comfortable what we're doing in inventory. We are leveraging our balance sheet. We're seeing higher sea and in-transit shipments. And it's generally in support of the growth in our Personal Systems business and to a less extent, in Print. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: I guess, my first question is for Dion. During the commentary, you mentioned the contractual market several times around the acquisition and then in some of the other areas in Print, but you've been offering Managed Print Services for many years. So I'm kind of curious if something has changed there in terms of how you're looking at it or if it's just the inclusion of A3. And then within contractual, sort of recurring revenue models, I'm also wondering what you're seeing in terms of DaaS for PCs. And I have a follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Shannon. Indeed, we're seeing increased demand from customers in their quest to move from a transactional relationship to a much deeper contractual relationship. And of course, the acquisition of the Samsung S-Print business was designed to give us access to a complete range of A3 products, which largely play in that they're almost exclusively contractual in nature. And that provides us an opportunity to tap into the $55 billion A3 market, which is, again, largely contractual. What, I guess, I'm alluding to in my prepared remarks is it's not just A3 that is contractual. It's also A4 that's moving into contractual, and a customer often has a mix of both A3 and A4. So largely, we're starting to think about the business and our customers through the lens of transactional and contractual. The Apogee acquisition was obviously designed, and the strategic rationale was to tap into this growing trend towards contractual. For those of you who are not familiar with Apogee, they are the largest independent print and document service provider in Europe. And they've got a really proven track record, as Steve alluded to, for growth and a deep set of capabilities in the contractual space. So with Apogee, we're going to gain access to new profit pools by expanding our ability to deliver value-added services and accelerate the deployment of our technology into this growing contractual office printing market, especially amongst SMBs. And it really augments the 3 existing go-to-market motions that we have, the direct motion, the traditional IT channels motion that we've had for the longest time. And now with us getting into A3s, we're more and more working with these office equipment dealers or OEDs. And we were underrepresented in OEDs, and Apogee is squarely in the space. And they enhance our ability to deliver the solutions and services necessary to win in this market. 
Shannon Cross: Okay, great. And then, Steve, can you talk a bit about cash flow? Clearly, it's strong, continues to -- you continue to overachieve in terms of cash flow and [ helped deliver] [indiscernible] billion at least. And so I'm curious when you look at cash flow this year -- and I know you're not going to give guidance for next year, but just how should we sort of think about recurring versus nonrecurring and whether there may be some puts and takes in the model both for the next quarter or so and then looking forward? 
Steven Fieler: Sure. Thanks, Shannon. I think at the simplest level, we do expect that our free cash flow will grow in line with earnings over time. And so when I do reflect upon our performance year-to-date at $3.3 billion, we are growing free cash flow ahead of earnings. And that is on the strength of our Personal Systems volume and the negative cash conversion cycle that it drives. In Q3 specifically, which helped the year-to-date performance, we did have an improvement in our cash conversion cycle to minus 34 days, and so that was a benefit to our cash flow. When I think about the full year, similar to last year, we would expect that our cash conversion cycle would align more closely to what we described at SAM, which was a minus 29 to minus 30 days. And that's why the at least $3.7 billion, we think, is a prudent guide. But to sort of get to the meat of the question, when you're thinking about our cash flow, I would think about it very consistent to our earnings and earnings growth over time. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: I'm wondering why you didn't see more operating profit leverage in the quarter. You did have higher volume and revenues. You have a cost takeout program in place, and particularly with Samsung, you were expecting to have more cost takeout as the year progressed. And yes, you were aggressive in placing units, but your printer unit growth was pretty similar to the last 2 quarters. So why do you feel you didn't see more operating profit leverage this quarter? And then I have a follow-up, please. 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I'll take that one, Toni. So I would say our results and performance are really in line with the strategy and in essence, what we said we would do. We are delivering today and building for the future across our core growth and future categories. We are driving incremental operating profit dollars and earnings per share up $0.09 year-over-year. To specifically address your question, when I look at the year-over-year performance, our Personal Systems business did add about $1 billion of revenue and they did have op margin expansion year-over-year. So I really think the gist of it is around the Print business. Our Print business did add about $0.5 billion of revenue and did grow operating profit dollars as well year-over-year, but it did come out a lower rate. Last year, we had 17.3% op margin. This year is 16% op margin. Really, the primary driver, and this is similar to the prior couple quarters, was the addition of S-Print. At the beginning of the year, we outlined that we had expected S-Print added on top of existing business to add another $1.4 billion and to be $0.01 accretive for the year. The simple math on that is  a 1% op margin, albeit back-end loaded. That's really the primary driver of why we didn't see as much drop and had a lower margin. We also do continue to invest in our growth in future categories, A3 and 3D Printing specifically. We see opportunities to disrupt the big markets there. We did place more units as you said, and our Supplies mix is down year-over-year. To a lesser extent, we saw some incremental raw material costs on the Print side. But the net of it is, is when you add it all up, I think we're operating closer to 16% range and driving incremental operating profit dollars year-over-year. 
Dion Weisler: I think that was really well articulated, Steve. The only add I would make is that when I refer to us playing our own game, this is exactly what I was talking about. It's about us executing against our strategy that has the 3 pillars of core, growth and future, some of that, which is still in investment mode. So I believe, consistently, our performance demonstrates our ability to drive improved operating profit dollars year-over-year whilst also investing for the long term. And that's something that I've committed to since we separated almost 3 years ago. 
Toni Sacconaghi: And to follow up, as you noted, your cash return to shareholders has been year-to-date slightly above your 75% high end of your range. But 75% of that return has been through buybacks and 25% through dividends. So I guess, the question that I have is why is not a north of 75% cash return to shareholders something that's -- why is that not sustainable? And then as we think about a total return to shareholders, initially post the split, it was more balanced between dividends and buybacks. Is there a incremental bias to buybacks and we should expect this kind of ratio on a go-forward basis? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. So our capital allocation strategy is in support of our business strategy. It does give us ability to invest in our business to drive long-term returns across the core, growth and future. It does give us the ability to support our shift to contractual to maintain investment-grade credit rating for our customers and also the flexibility to accelerate our strategy when we have opportunities to do so. And I think the Apogee transaction that we referred to earlier is a good example. So we think we've got a capital allocation strategy that is working. As you point out, we have returned roughly 80% year-to-date, and we were active in buying back shares. We saw an attractive opportunity to do so, and so we took advantage of it. As it relates to dividends themselves, our board does consider a dividend policy periodically. If we have any updated changes, we'll certainly communicate that to you. 
Operator: And the next questioner today, we have Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Jyhhaw Liu: This is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. From a commodity perspective, I think NAND pricing and to some extent, DRAM pricing has been more favorable versus 90 days ago. In the event that you're able to benefit from component price declines, should we expect a near-term margin lift for the Personal Systems segment? Or do you anticipate having to share some of this benefit with your customers and also to maintain your share in the PC market? 
Steven Fieler: Well, we look at the overall basket of commodities, you mentioned a couple, but the overall basket of commodities and logistics cost. Our perspective is that sequentially from Q3 to Q4 it is stable, so it is, in essence, a neutral impact. We are also though seeing much more currency volatility and specifically more recently, the dollar strengthening. So as we think about the drop rate or op margin in the Personal Systems business and the impact on pricing, we have to think holistically about all the various factors and market dynamics from commodities to FX, and that certainly will be factored into how we show up in Q4. 
Jyhhaw Liu: And I also had a question about your broader contractual and services business, which is inclusive of Device as a Service, Managed Print Services and Instant Ink among others. Given the growth in these businesses and the acquisition of Apogee, how should we think about your longer-term target mix of services or contractual revenue? And what are some of the milestones and metrics we can use to help us better track the performance of your services portfolio? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. I think in many of the examples you described, certainly Device as a Service as an example, it isn't material to our overall results today, but it is material to our long-term strategy. And I think as these businesses continue to evolve and continue to grow and accelerate, we will be able to provide more visibility and metrics in the future. But right now I think the metrics we're sharing around our core business are more material, but I think we can evolve that over time. 
Dion Weisler: And I think specifically as it relates to Personal Systems, we've said that we believe the business over the long term is in the range of 3% to 5%. We delivered 3.9% this quarter. Over the long term, we expect that services is a more margin-rich opportunity for us. So in addition to the mixing up that we have been doing, services will enable that window above the 4% that we traditionally had to now the 3% to 5%. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi. 
Jim Suva: On your Printing business, looking at the operating margins, it looks like year-over-year -- and when we look at it that way, that way we [ don't have ] seasonality. But year-over-year, it's been declining for about the past 3 quarters. Sounds like a lot of investments. But when will these investments really start to pay out? When we think about the ink consumption that I do at home or things like that, I would think that people would be replacing their toner and ink more than once every year or so. So when are these investments really going to pay dividends and how should we think about that? Or is there something else like the Samsung integration or the recent acquisition that is maybe not making it as comparable? 
Steven Fieler: Yes. And so to follow up on to the remarks earlier in the strategy we are driving in Print. It includes integrating S-Print, placing units, investing in the growth in future, but also driving productivity. And when I look at our rate now it is more driven by the addition of S-Print than any of those other factors. That's why I'd expect in the short to midterm to be closer to the bottom end of our long-term range around 16% because it is the strategy we're executing. We're driving operating profit dollar expansion. You've seen OP dollar improvement in Print for the past 4 quarters. And yes, we are investing in our growth categories, and we do think there's a long-term opportunity there. But you first have to build your installed base, place those units, and you're going to get the supplies attached later on. 
Jim Suva: Later on, like when does that later on come? 
Steven Fieler: In the years ahead. Just like we have built the rest of our business in Print, it takes time to build your installed base and have supplies attached. And so when we look out to the -- certainly the years ahead, we do expect that we continue to drop the OP dollars but also get the margin expansion from a rate perspective. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. 
Sherri Scribner: You've seen very robust growth in the printer business over the past 2 years. In the past couple of quarters, a lot of that robustness has come from ASP improvements. ASPs are up somewhere around 600 to 700 basis points more than units for you guys. As we think about the next couple of quarters and stabilizing of some of the component costs, how much of a benefit do you think ASP increases will be for the business? I guess, another way to ask it would be do you think you'll continue to be able to mix up to higher ASP products. Or should we see some stabilization where revenue and units grow at similar rates? 
Dion Weisler: Sherri, [ confirm ] [indiscernible]. Were you talking about Print there or PCs? 
Sherri Scribner: I'm sorry, PCs. 
Steven Fieler: Okay, great. Maybe I'll comment, first, Dion, just on that ASP environment. So Sherri, in Q3, let me use that as sort of an example, which can set up sort of a comment on the prospectively. But in Q3, we did see, once again, positive ASPs. That was driven -- like other quarters, really bifurcated between 2 factors, the first of which is we continue to drive a better product mix. I'd say that's roughly 1/3 of the benefit we saw in the quarter, and the remaining 2/3 was just overall pricing. And again, that sort of takes in the multiple factors from rising component logistics cost, which lends to increase in pricing but also takes into account what's happening to FX and overall competitive environment. And so looking forward, certainly an important part of our strategy is to drive and continue to drive product mix. In many of those categories, we are under indexed today, so we do feel like we've got opportunity. That being said, as commodities begin to stabilize here, that is less of a year-over-year tailwind on ASPs. But I think most importantly, we're going to focus on continuing to great -- develop great products to the market, and that's really what's going to drive, as much as anything, the improvement on the revenue side. I don't know if, Dion, you have any other comments you'd make on the PC. 
Dion Weisler: I think the only other comment, Steve, would be our increased focus as a business on Everything as a Service. And as we drive that strategy, it's roughly half the market, roughly half of the $334 billion TAM. That's a new opportunity for us as an organization where we're under-indexed. It's certainly a market trend. Our customers are looking to have that kind of contractual relationship with us. And I think that also drives growth in the future. 
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. And then switching gears to the Printing business. The margins related -- margins for that business are at the low end of your range, and you've made it quite clear that, that's related to the acquisition of Samsung. As we move into the fourth quarter, your commentary, Steve, seemed to suggest that margins would actually soften. So I guess, I'm trying to understand, should we think about 4Q margins falling below your long-term target and then possibly improving as we move into fiscal '19? 
Steven Fieler: I was not trying to imply that we would go below our 16% to 18% range. I was just trying to suggest that in the near to midterm, we'd be closer to the bottom end of that range. And so I think that reflects both Q4. I'm not going to comment any more specifically on the outlook. We have SAM coming up where we can kind of give the details about '19 and beyond. But for Q4, we would expect to still stay within our range. 
Operator: Next questioner today will be Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: Just as a follow-up to the last question, just trying to think about how you guys -- as we possibly see some normalization on the ASP benefits in the PC market, how you think about the growth dynamics of the PC market overall from a shipment perspective. Any kind of metrics you can share in terms of aged installed base and an opinion on what you think really kind of opens up the opportunities for the Everything as a Service to really start to drive the business model? Is there something that you're looking at specifically that starts to engage the customer base, the installed base on those opportunities that you see? 
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I think we've certainly been engaging that customer base, which is why we're outperforming the market. We outperformed the market again by 5.4 points this quarter. That resulted in us growing our revenue 12% on top of last year's 12% growth. So it wasn't against the -- an easy compare because we continue to play our own game of profitable growth of segmenting the market, of finding areas of growth that our engineering team and our people believe that we can engineer experiences that amaze them and encourage them to buy our products. And that's why we have had continuous share gain for the past 18 consecutive quarters we've outgrown the market. We broadly agree with the analysts that still predict the overall market will decline slightly in units in traditional PCs with relatively flattish revenue. Would suggest that ASPs will go up slightly. And in our business, we are taking change and turning it to opportunity. We have a consistent track record of doing that, whether that's a tougher currency environment or trade situations or other fluctuating market forces. What we are also obviously cognizant of is a Windows 7 sunset that will happen and the migration of customers to Windows 10. We think that's a little less spiky than it has been in the past. And the glide slope is a little smoother up and to the right because companies much like ours that have already fully deployed on Windows 10 have deployed Windows 10 earlier in the transition cycle than they have in previous cycles. So we think that's a positive stimulus in the market. So with all of that, we're poised to continue to gain profitable shares and move forward. 
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, just curious since you brought it up, the trade situation. How does -- how do you guys see that? Any effect at this point? Any concerns that you might have looking forward? 
Dion Weisler: Well, I don't think it has had a material impact on our business to date. We, like all companies, are monitoring the evolving market dynamics and the situation very closely. I can tell you that we don't speculate or comment on the situation until we know all the facts and things become more definitive. We continue to assess the actions that are announced and we go to work on making the best outcomes for our customers and our shareholders. And we work with the U.S. administration, make sure they understand our point of view on suggested changes. But our supply chain team and our go-to-market team and all areas of our business, including our board ecosystem of suppliers, customers and partners, work together to take any change and turn it to opportunity. And just we'll monitor the situation and evolve it as necessary. 
Steven Fieler: Just to be clear, our guidance does include the impact of tariffs in place, which, as Dion said, are not material to us. We have not included any potential impact from new tariffs being contemplated. 
Operator: And the final questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: So I had a couple of questions. I guess, one is with regard to the Supplies growth rate. I know that S-Print's in there and driving some of that year-over-year growth, but just curious if you guys would comment on what the underlying kind of organic growth there is. And if you don't want to comment on that, maybe just give us an update on whether you're still thinking flat next year as a possible outcome or a probable outcome. And then I have a follow-up. 
Steven Fieler: So we have been pretty predictive with what we call the 4-box model. And at the beginning of this year, Cathie outlined that we had expected from Q2 to Q4 that our Supplies would grow between 5% to 7% in constant currency, and that's actually exactly what we've been delivering. Within that 5% to 7% growth, that does incorporate legacy S-Print as well as HP Supplies. Given the fact that these businesses are integrated, our sales teams are selling SKUs and making trade-offs in the field, we do not have the ability to accurately break out what's inorganic versus organic, and that's why we put them together in our outlook. So we think forward to FY '19, we do have some headwinds. We do have some tailwinds, but we reflect on the 4-box model and what it's predicting. We have confidence that we will be flat to slightly up next year. 
Dion Weisler: And I think what you should expect from us is that we will continue to focus on executing against our strategy, both in our core as well as our growth initiatives in this area, which take time to fully play out into the P&L as Steve's alluded to throughout the call. We'll be relentless in our focus on optimizing all levers we have to impact Supplies with the right balance to ensure predictive value over the long term. I, like Steve, also have a lot of confidence in the predictive value of our 4-box model, which is the basis for what we guided for the rest of FY '18 and '19. 
Steven Fieler: No follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Okay. 
Steven Fieler: All right. 
Dion Weisler: So with that, I'd like to thank you all for taking the time to join us today. I'm really pleased with our Q3 performance. This quarter's another example of how we're delivering against our results by combining innovation with operational excellence. That said, we're never satisfied. Profitable growth will continue to be our priority as we move forward. Our strategy is working. The team is incredibly focused. And our commitment to our customers, partners, employees and investors has never been stronger. So overall, I think we're in a very strong position with our business and our reinvention journey remains confident in our strategy and our ability to grow. With that, I look forward to seeing you all at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 3 at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City. Thank you all. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining, and you may now disconnect.

Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to the Q2 2018 HP, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] And please note that today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Beth Howe: Good afternoon. I am Beth Howe, Head of Investor Relations for HP, Inc. and I would like to welcome you to the fiscal 2018 second quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Cathie Lesjak, HP’s Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations webpage at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to the forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions please refer to HP’s SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available now and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HP’s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2018 and HP’s other SEC filings. During this webcast, unless otherwise specifically noted, all quarterly comparisons are year-over-year comparisons with the corresponding year ago quarter. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today’s earnings release for those reconciliations. And now I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Beth. Let me start by saying it’s great to have you back on the Investor Relations team. I am quite pleased with our Q2 performance. It’s yet another quarter of strength, growth and consistent execution of our reinvention. We are creating opportunities and taking advantage of favorable market dynamics to deliver strong revenue and profitability across our segments and our regions. This was our 10th quarter since separation and you are seeing a sharp focus on innovation and execution, continued improvement on our business fundamentals, and an intense focus on long-term and sustainable growth. Our winning formula is straightforward. We are focusing on delivering operational excellence, predictable shareholder returns and prioritizing profitable growth, all aligned to our core growth and future strategy. Looking at our Q2 fiscal year ‘18 results, we added $1.6 billion to the top line growing revenue 13% to $14 billion. We grew top line and bottom line in both Personal Systems and Print. We delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and repurchased $800 million of stock and we delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.48, an increase of 20% and at the higher end of our range. The market remains dynamic and competitive, but I am confident in our strategy and ability to continue to grow faster than the market and out-execute the competition. We are playing our own game pursuing the heat in the market and our strategy is paying off. Let me review some of the highlights. Personal Systems delivered another exceptional quarter. Net revenue was up 14% and that comes on top of 10% growth a year ago on quarter two. This is now six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. This performance and the innovation coming out of this team is nothing short of incredible. HP continued to outperform the PC market with broad-based growth across all segments and product categories, not only are we seeing strong growth in notebooks, this is also the third consecutive quarter of double-digit desktop growth. In the first calendar quarter, we outgrew the PC market by 4.6 points, achieving 22.7% share. While we are proud of these results, share gain continues to be an outcome not an objective. Profitable growth continues to be our focus. In quarter two, operating profit dollars grew double-digits and operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 3.8%. Our team continues to drive improved productivity and product mix. One of the ways we drive value and profitable growth is through careful segmentation and aggressively pursuing targeted opportunities. One example is healthcare where safety, security and regulatory compliance are critical. We recently introduced a portfolio of products purpose built for healthcare providers by optimizing clinical workflows with RFID readers and improving collaboration capability for telemedicine. And this is connected to our innovation story and the sprinkles of magic we deliver that continued to be recognized in the market as first and best. This past quarter, we introduced the world’s first Chromebook detachable, the world’s widest curved all-in-one and the world’s first detachable in tablet with an integrated privacy screen. This is how we win with partners and customers. Much of our success is driven by the strength of our commercial channel and retail relationships. For us, the channel is a great competitive advantage. We are deeply committed to listening to our partners, understanding their customers’ needs, and delivering innovation that drives growth. We are coming off three of our largest partner events of the year where we met with thousands of partners from all regions. Their response was tremendous and we are consistently hearing that our innovation engine and go-to-market programs are setting a new standard in helping them to grow their businesses. In addition to the core, we remain focused on our strategic growth areas. In Personal Systems this quarter, we made progress in areas such as retail point-of-sale and device-as-a-service, where we saw strong double-digit growth. In fact, we closed the deal with a major global fast food chain to implement both retail point-of-sale and device-as-a-service solutions. Just like Personal Systems, the Print business delivered the trifecta of revenue, profit and share growth in quarter two. Total Print revenue was up 11%, with growth across commercial hardware, consumer hardware and supplies. We are seeing growth across all regions and broadly across the business. Print units were up 13% and supplies revenue grew 8% further supporting our confidence in the health of the Print business for the long-term. The overall Print hardware market grew 1.7% in the first calendar quarter and we grew faster than the market adding 1 point of share. With our continued productivity initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and lower product costs, we remain strongly positioned to place NPV positive units. We are on a journey to reinvent print and our focus on this enabled us to achieve several important and innovative milestones. We launched the HP NVISS Printer to the International Space Station in April, where it is currently in use alongside HP Z-Book workstations. We are investing in next-generation printing with a focus on modern lifestyle innovations like the new mobile-optimized HP LaserJet Pros and our expanded offering of HP voice-enabled printing. In A3, we continue to onboard new partners and gain year-over-year share. This business is strategic to us given the higher attach rates of supplies and services. Our A3 solutions provide our partners and customers with cost savings, increase manageability, and peace of mind with best-in-class security. As an example, ImageNet Consulting lowered its service cost are more than 15% using HP Smart Device Services remote management. And I am pleased with the progress in S-Print since the acquisition closed this past November. We continue to rationalize SKUs and streamline processes while we are working on new innovations and adding features and options that our customers and partners truly value. Finally, in our graphics solutions business, we closed our largest packaging deal ever with ePac Flexible Packaging, a leader in web-based digital printing that quadrupled its capacity with HP Indigo presses. We also unveiled the industry first hybrid latex printer capable of printing on both rigid and flexible materials for the print service provider community. As you know, the 3D printing business is a huge opportunity for us and one where we aim to disrupt the $12 trillion global manufacturing market. The growth trajectory and momentum behind this business continues. We are seeing an increase in customers placing repeat orders, upgrading their systems for higher volume manufacturing and scaling with double-digit unit installations. Forecast 3D, one of the oldest and largest 3D manufacturers in the U.S. is expanding and upgrading its entire fleet to our 4210 solutions as they respond to growing demand and full-scale production. They are expecting to produce millions of parts on Multi Jet Fusion in the coming year. And Jabil, one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers is now deploying Multi Jet Fusion in the U.S. and Asia as part of their distributed manufacturing strategy. We continue to make incredible progress across key industry verticals and expand into new geographies, including our market entry into Mexico. Overall, I am very pleased with our Q2 results and the efforts of our team. But as always, we have more work to do. We are never satisfied and we see plenty of room for us to grow, innovate, improve our cost structure and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Now, before I turn the call over to Cathie, let me address the other news we announced today. After 32 incredible years and the last 11 years as Chief Financial Officer, Cathie and I have decided it’s the right time to transition CFOs before she retires in early calendar 2019. Today, I am thrilled to announce the appointment of Steve Fieler, our Head of Treasury as HP’s new CFO. Cathie will become our Interim Chief Operating Officer lending her experience and leadership to help define our future of operations. Both appointments will begin on July 1. On behalf of all HP employees and shareholders, I want to thank Cathie for her remarkable contributions and commitment to shareholder value. We have been on an amazing journey together since separation and Cathie deserves tremendous credit for helping drive our performance and reinvention as a company. She is being my partner for the last 3 years and I could not ask for a better confidant and leader. Cathie has also cultivated incredible shareholder respect through their integrity, transparency and world-class financial discipline. She has built a deep and talented finance organization capable of leading us into the future. Steve is a great example of that bench. Having worked with him for many years, I am excited to have him join my executive leadership team and I am looking forward to our partnership. Steve has an impressive background as a leader in finance and operations and has the reputation for operational excellence and accountability. He is a great addition to the team as we continue to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I am now going to turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and financial outlook. And Cathie after 46 earnings calls, make this a good one.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. I have been privileged to serve as CFO for the past 11 years or as you noted 46 quarters, but who is counting. It has been an honor to work as part of the team with so many outstanding dedicated employees during a time of tremendous change and reinvention. With Steve taking over as CFO, I am convinced HP is in excellent hands. As many of you already know, Steve is an experienced finance and Investor Relations executive with a deep understanding of HP. He will be an outstanding CFO and a great successor. Now, looking at the results for Q2, we continue to deliver consistent results, with strong revenue growth and increases in operating profit dollars, free cash flow and earnings per share. Net revenue was $14 billion, up 13% or up 10% in constant currency. Our performance remains strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, Americas grew 7%, EMEA was up 21% and APJ grew 13%. Gross margin was 19.3%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, gross margin was up 150 basis points higher than normal seasonality primarily driven by favorable rate in Personal Systems and improved mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.7 billion were up 16% driven by the addition of S-Print, along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. Non-GAAP net OI&E expense was $84 million for the quarter, with a non-GAAP tax rate of 16% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.6 billion shares. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $57 million, acquisition-related charges of $45 million, amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, debt extinguishment cost of $126 million as well as non-operating retirement related credits of $53 million and the related tax impact on all of these items. It also excludes a net gain of $424 million for tax adjustments. The gain was a result of several tax settlements across various jurisdictions covering a multiyear period. The gain was partially offset by an additional provisional revaluation of the deferred tax assets due to U.S. tax reform and a $671 million tax indemnification. The tax indemnification amount is associated with our Tax Matters Agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company since these tax settlements were based on pre-separation tax years. As a result, Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share, was $0.64. Turning to the segment, Personal Systems net revenue remained very strong, delivering $8.8 billion, up 14%. We are encouraged as the results continued to be broad-based reflecting execution against our strategy and an innovative product portfolio. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 10% and commercial revenue was up 16%. By product category, revenue was up 15% for notebooks, up 16% for desktops and up 9% for workstation. Our disciplined focus on market segmentation enabled profitable share gain. Personal Systems operating profit dollars grew year-over-year and operating margin was 3.8%, up 60 basis points as we lack some of the largest commodity cost increases we saw last year. We will continue to balance pricing to adjust for the impacts of currency and commodity and logistics costs and other market dynamics. Turning to printing, revenue was $5.2 billion in the quarter, up 11%. We are pleased with this growth and are encouraged by the progress we are making integrating S-Print. Total hardware units were up 13% with consumer units up 4% and commercial units up 88%. Sequentially, commercial units were up 10%. In calendar Q1, overall print unit share was 42%, up 1 point year-over-year and up 4 points sequentially. Q2 supplies revenue of $3.4 billion was up 8% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. The supplies mix of total print revenue was 65% and we continue to operate the lower ceiling for supplies channel inventory. We also had good momentum in our contractual offerings. We are pleased with the strong growth in Instant Ink, where we are growing our global subscriber base and in MPS, we continue to grow revenue. Print operating profit grew $19 million and operating margin was 16% in the quarter, down 1.3 points year-over-year, but up 20 basis points sequentially. The primary drivers of the year-over-year margin decline were strong unit placements and go-to-market investments largely as a result of adding S-Print. Additionally, we saw increased raw material cost in the quarter, which we expect to continue throughout the year. Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation, Q2 cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion and free cash flow was $937 million. For the full year, we now expect free cash flow to be at least $3.7 billion. Cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days, improved 3 days sequentially driven by a 7-day increase in days payable outstanding offset by a 3 day increase in days sales outstanding and a 1 day increase in days of inventory. Increases in days of inventory and days payable outstanding are largely a result of negotiated payment terms and leveraging our balance sheet. Consistent with the cash priorities described in Q1 in connection with U.S. tax reform, we successfully completed a $1.85 billion debt tender during Q2. Additionally, we had capital returns of $801 million in share repurchases and $227 million in cash dividends. For the full year, we still expect to deliver returns toward the higher end of our long-term range of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. Before turning to guidance, I want to reiterate the importance of focusing on our cost structure. Because of the synergies we see in Print, including the result of the acquisition, combined with other cost efficiency opportunities, we will be expanding our current restructuring program. Compared to the high-end of our prior restructuring outlook, we expect the restructuring costs to increase by $150 million to $200 million. This includes both labor and non-labor related actions. We still expect to complete the plan by the end of fiscal 2019, including these incremental actions. We expect that the total gross annual run-rate savings before reinvestments to increase by at least $75 million over the higher end of the previously communicated range beginning in fiscal ‘20. Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we expect that logistic and overall component cost will continue to increase throughout FY ‘18. This headwind and any net impact on re-pricing will ultimately depend upon actual market demand, competitive dynamics and any impact from currency. In printing, we have began to see increases in raw material costs in Q2 and expect that pressure to continue during the second half. In addition, we expect to continue to have strong positive NPV unit placements, which should continue to push the hardware revenue mix higher. We will also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We are also updating the way we estimate our quarterly non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better visibility across quarterly reporting periods. Going forward, we’ll report our non-GAAP earnings incorporating a 16% tax rate calculated using long-term non-GAAP financial projections. The non-GAAP tax rate is based on our financial forecast and all currently available information and maybe subject to change for a variety of impacts, including the company’s ongoing analysis of the tax act over the measurement period, the rapidly changing global tax environment or other changes to the company’s strategy or business operations. Additionally, we would expect our cash tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 2% for the full year. With all that in mind, we expect Q3 ‘18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, is in the range of $0.49 to $0.52. Q3 ‘18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.47 to $0.51. We are raising our full year fiscal ‘18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.97 to $2.02 and our full year fiscal ‘18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.82. With that, let’s open up the call for questions.
Operator: Thank you. And we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead.
Steve Milunovich: Thank you and congratulations to you Cathie and Steve. Cathie, do you expect the printer margin to rise sequentially through the next two quarters or whether that will be offset by the higher raw material costs and higher unit placements? And specifically what raw material costs are you referring to that are going up?
Cathie Lesjak: Sure. So, in terms of the raw material costs what we are really seeing is increases in resin, plastics as well as DRAM, because there is DRAM also in the printer. Resins and plastics are largely up as a result of oil prices increasing. So that’s where what we are seeing there. In terms of how to think about the OP rate over time, we don’t really have an explicit rate for operating profit for print in any particular period. We do long-term expect that the margins will be 16% to 18%, which we talked about at SAM, which was pretty consistent with what we have seen historically. When you think about the progress in the, I would say, near to mid-term the way to think about it is as we integrate S-Print, ramp the A3 business as well as the 3D business and execute on our productivity initiatives, we do expect that the margins will improve from the 16%, but that’s really a kind of a mid-term kind of comment.
Steve Milunovich: Okay. And could you update us in terms of the buyback, I am not sure last quarter you were at that point ready to talk about the use of repatriated cash and so forth?
Cathie Lesjak: So in the first half, we repurchased shares for a total price of about $1.3 billion. In the second quarter, we did about 800 million of share repurchases, which is higher than what we have typically done. When we look forward to the rest of the year, we will be active in the market, but the second half will really be consistent with our capital return priorities. So, we have talked about the fact that we are going to be towards the higher end of 50% to 75% of our free cash flow this year and our buying in the second half will be consistent with that. And keep in mind that, that towards the higher end of 50% to 75% applies to now the increased free cash flow of at least $3.7 billion for the year.
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Paul Coster: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. So, I will move it to one if I may. Cathie, if you can just give us some sense of what the organic versus the acquired growth rate for the printer business was that would be helpful? And Dion, I guess we are seeing some potentially transformative consolidation taking place in the printer industry, arguably part of the end game, it must be trying for opportunities and risks. Can you just talk to us about what the near-term tactical opportunities might be given some of the strategic uncertainty amongst the two players? And also how it’s changing your view of what HP will do during this end game?
Cathie Lesjak: So, why don’t I start? Paul, as we talked about, I think it was last quarter or maybe even the quarter before, we are integrating the S-Print business into the core HP print business frankly as fast as we can. And the reason for that is that it’s going to drive shareholder value. So as a result of doing that, there isn’t really a way to meaningfully separate what is organic growth versus inorganic growth for the Print segment. I think the best way to think about it is that Print by all means has had a very strong first half in terms of performing. We are very pleased with the top line growth as well as the unit placements, the margin expansion and frankly the supplies revenue growth as well.
Dion Weisler: And thanks Paul for the question, the print industry is no different to the Personal Systems industry. I think we have seen the Personal Systems industry consolidating over many years and it’s still consolidating today and we are able to continue to grow in the Personal Systems businesses as you’ve seen us do double-digits for the past six quarters by playing our own game. And I think the Print business is no different. There is not room in an essentially flat market for 14 players. And so I think naturally over time that market will consolidate as well, but I don’t subscribe to the fact that it has to be done through acquisition. I think we made a very strategic execution of the Samsung print business that was a technology acquisition as well as an acquisition of some incredibly talented people, but it wasn’t a market share play. As we look at the market today, we feel that from a technology perspective we are very well positioned in both ink as well as laser in A4 as well as A3 and we continue to move towards a service-orientated business. And so by adding the sprinkles of magic that we do across the portfolio, I expect that we can outpace the market. Having said all of that, I have always said that M&A is an important part of our strategy that we wouldn’t surprise anybody, any of our investors or the industry with what we would do that. When we do think about M&A, it would leave somewhere on our strategy page and would need to bolster our strategic intent and accelerate our strategy that it will be returns based and it would be weighted against other organic options and alternative uses of cash that it would come at a reasonable cost and be modest in size and that we’ll remain thoughtful and disciplined and ensure that the opportunities are compelling and will maximize shareholder value.
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sherri Scribner: Hi, thank you. Cathie, you mentioned the operating expenses were up a little bit sequentially related to the S-Print acquisition. Can you maybe help us think about how operating margins will trend now that Samsung is in the business? Should we seem operating expenses at these levels or do you expect to be able to bring operating expenses down somewhat as we move through the year based on the cost-cutting initiatives?
Cathie Lesjak: Sure. So, Sherri, what I actually said was the OpEx is up largely as a result of S-Print, but not exclusively. We are also – we have made incremental investments in R&D and go-to-market as well and I believe that those will continue. Now, clearly when you look at either the total company or specifically the print business, our S-Print business has been in investment node in the first half. And as we talked about at the total company level that it would be accretive by about $0.01 in the full year. So, we do expect it to shift to making some money, which is always good. But keep in mind that even as it makes the money, it’s going to be dilutive to operating margin rates. I think that, that’s very important when you think about the trajectory of the print operating margin rate in fiscal ‘18.
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just looking at the supplies business, it’s trending very strongly and clearly you have turned that segment around, how should we think about growth in Supplies, I think we have talked about kind of flat maybe slight growth this year, I know there is some inorganic pieces in there, but it seems like you are trending well ahead of that supplies?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Sherri, what we expect that kind of the sum of Q2, Q3 and Q4 on a year-over-year basis that we would say see 5% to 7% growth in constant currency. That’s what we expect for FY ‘18. For FY ‘19 we expect that supplies will be flat to slightly up. Once we have an apples and apples comparison with S-Print in both years.
Sherri Scribner: And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi was Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you and congratulations Cathie on your tenure and all best wishes for the future.
Cathie Lesjak: Thank you.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and a follow-up please. First on PCs, ASPs were up about 7% year-over-year and we have seen real strength in ASPs for the last several quarters. Perhaps you can help us understand how much of it you think is coming from DRAM versus changes in your mix like gaming and accordingly sort of how sustainable once DRAM starts declining, how sustainable are ASP increases in PCs going forward or what’s sort of the right way to think about ASP changes in a more normalized environment? And I have a follow-up please.
Cathie Lesjak: So Tony, we saw good progress as you mentioned in ASPs both year-over-year as well as sequentially. And in both cases, the positive mix shift that we are driving into premium is having a significant impact on the ASPs and we believe that those will continue to be the case. We also saw as you mentioned we definitely saw some help from DRAM pricing or pricing that we took as a result of commodity cost increases. And depending on what happens to commodity costs that piece will obviously go up or down. And then from a foreign exchange perspective also with the tougher dollar, we could see some ASP increases as a result of currency as well.
Toni Sacconaghi: But was the impact from mix greater than the impact from price from DRAM and I will ask my follow-up, just on supplies back to printer supplies, I think last quarter you had said that the contribution from S-Print was about 6 points and I know it’s become more monies now, but would it be fair to sort of assume that the contribution from S-Sprint was sort of in that vicinity this quarter and were there any changes to your channel inventory? I think you said you were under your ceiling, but it’s a little bit of a different commentary from prior quarters where I think you said you were within your range. So just the follow-up on the ASPs and then supplies please? Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: Sure. The impact of mix on ASPs was material and greater than the pricing impact. In terms of supplies, I will go back to what I said earlier, we really have integrated the business here. So, it’s really not – we are really not able to meaningfully determine what was S-Print’s contribution to supplies versus the core, because we are rationalizing SKUs, we are now selling more HP SKUs than S-Print SKUs and therefore are those supplies S-Print supplies or are they HP supplies. So it’s just gotten. It’s not just gotten money, it’s just well-integrated, which is exactly what you want us to do, because that’s what’s going to drive the value. In terms of the channel inventory, I think we changed our commentary I want to say two or three quarters ago, when we really now are managing below a ceiling and we have been consistently below the ceiling for supplies frankly since we made the change to our supply sales model.
Dion Weisler: And Toni, I think we have consistently said and you and I have talked about it, we have this relentless focus on execution and we have a continued confidence in their predictive value of the full box model, where you can expect us to drive continued improvements across all full boxes to maintain supply stabilization in ‘19. We anticipate the headwinds that Cathie mentioned earlier. We have contemplated them. We have captured them in the expectations and we have guided that for the rest of ‘18 as well as ‘19.
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Katy Huberty: Thank you, Cathie. My congratulations as well. I have two questions, I will just ask them together. First of all, can you bridge the $0.05 guidance increase on EPS from roughly $1.95 to $2 at the midpoint? And then secondly from a free cash flow perspective, if you look at the last couple of years over half of free cash flow came in the back half of the year, which would suggest that you could do $4 billion plus this year, why is seasonality different this year versus the past couple of years?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Katy since it’s my last call, I think I am going to say if I give an inch you take a mile, I am just on the free cash flow. So, when we look at the first half free cash flow, we are very pleased with the performance. It’s really based on the strength primarily of Personal Systems to use Dion’s term a double-double and a double-double is pretty significant from a timing perspective to cash flow given the negative cash conversion cycle of Personal Systems. We expect Personal Systems to do well in the second half although compares are getting increasingly difficult. So I think that’s one piece. The other piece is that in the first half we did have some one-time positive cash flow items that won’t repeat themselves. And then when you think about the bridge for the $0.05 increase that you talked about, it’s largely as a result of the share repurchases that we did in Q2 that were in excess of what we had originally expected when we provided the guide. So, you have got the follow-on effect of that as well as obviously the share repurchases that we are going to do in the second half consistent with returning towards the high-end of the 50% to 75% of our free cash flow.
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much. And I echo the congrats, Cathie. I hope you get to take a nice long vacation sometime in 2019. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks for saying that, Shannon in 2019.
Shannon Cross: As I say but not before that.
Dion Weisler: Exactly.
Cathie Lesjak: I have got a lot to do, I am not going anywhere.
Shannon Cross: In terms of the 3D print business, Dion, maybe you can talk a bit about what you are hearing from customers, how you are seeing the ramp, I know you have a few new products that will be coming out this year, so just curious as to how it’s progressing in line or ahead of your expectations?
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I am really excited about the leadership position we have taken in 3D printing and the segment where we operate in a very short period of time, we are on the path towards disrupting this $12 trillion global manufacturing industry. But it’s a long path, I have always said this is a 5 to 10-year journey and we are making the investments today to really secure shareholder value both today and for the future we are seeing significant sales momentum, including repeat orders from customers as well as service bureaus. We are expanding our adoption across key verticals. We are seeing more than 50% of the customer benchmarks. So these are when a customer is contemplating buying 3D printing they will give us a file and they say can you make this path for us who want to see and test this path. And we are of course checking what that path is for and then 50% of the cases therefore production applications, which is really what differentiates us with this technology. And some of the recent highlights, Forecast 3D, one of the oldest and largest 3D manufacturers in the U.S. has expanded its Multi Jet Fusion footprint. It’s upgrading its entire fleet to our 4210 solutions and as they respond to the growing demand, they are expecting to produce millions of parts on Multi Jet Fusion in the coming year. Jabil, one of the largest contract manufacturers is now deploying Multi Jet Fusion in the U.S. and Asia as part of its distributor manufacturing strategy. And this quarter, we also continue to grow unit placement across all verticals and geographies, including new customers in the automotive and electronics industry. And we officially announced our market entry into Mexico as well. So stay tuned this is a great business for the long-term. We remain really confident.
Shannon Cross: Thank you. And then Cathie, I had a follow-up on cash flow, from like I know I think it’s going to probably kick you if I ask this, but from a 50,000 foot level, this year obviously cash flow has been up year-over-year or should be and so how do we think about it from sort of recurring going forward? Obviously, PCs play into it, but when we think about more sort of the recurring level of cash flow, it should come off the model maybe you could talk about puts and takes that happened this year that will or will not repeat?
Cathie Lesjak: Sure. Actually, thank you for the question. I probably should have mentioned this when we were talking about cash flow. Over time, free cash flow basically grows in line with earnings. And so we do get a timing benefit when Personal Systems has a particularly strong growth sequentially, because of course it has a negative cash conversion cycle, but over time, the cash flow that it generates is going to be largely, its profit. And so there is a pull-in for cash. And so over the long-term you should really think about free cash flow being in line with earnings.
Operator: Our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Congrats to you Cathie from me as well. Your margins have been pretty robust despite these commodity headwinds. Can you just talk about the commodity environment in terms of memory both DRAM and NAND I think you said that some commodities will be a headwind, but how have they changed relative to your expectation from last quarter or are you seeing any impact from extended lead times in some items like passive? And I have a follow-up for Dion.
Cathie Lesjak: Wamsi, we have seen an increase in commodity costs. If you think about going back to our security analyst meeting, we actually thought it was going to flatten out in Q4 of last year or towards the end of Q4 of last year. So, we have seen an increase that at that time we had not expected. But as important as commodity costs are as well as by the way the logistics costs are also going up a bit, it’s really about how you respond. What are the tools at your disposal to figure out how you mitigate those types of increases and this team has just done a tremendous job at mitigating and managing in that environment. In fact, I put my money on them in a tough commodity environment. So think about it we have used things like pricing, we have used our supply chain scale, we have leveraged our balance sheet and then to go back to Toni’s question we have done a great job of driving positive mix. And so those are the types of things that we will continue to use to kind of manage this tough environment. And I have every confidence that we will continue to be successful.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay, thanks Cathie. And Dion, as a follow-up to the question on the strategic changes that are happening, can you talk about the opportunity if you are seeing any that has been created for HP, particularly in managed print services and in the copier space given some of the events at Xerox and can you give an update on your Ink in the Office initiative as well? Thank you.
Dion Weisler: Sure. Look, the way I think about change in the marketplace is that change equals opportunity and so whilst these competitors that are distracted with structure and that generally presents an opportunity in the marketplace. So what we are doing is doubling down and playing our own game. If we are out in front of a customer making a call and our competitors are gathered around the water fountain, then we are out in front of the customer and that’s really where we want to be spending our time. I think we have incredible assets inside the organization. We are very focused on managed print services. There is no doubt the business model is shifting even in the traditional A4 space. It’s moving from transactional to contractual that’s happening at a different price in every country, but it is a mega-trend that we certainly want to be out in front of managed print services, we have been doing now for many years. And I think we have really mastered the art of how to manage this for a customer and the pipeline not only for managed print services, but device-as-a-service is really strong, so PC-as-a-service and increasingly customers are looking to have everything both at Print and Personal Systems and workstations and even 3D printing in the future as a service. So we remain focused on that. With regards to Ink in the Office, it’s an important part of our overall strategy. We have two incredible technology platforms. We have an ink-based platform and we have a laser-based platform. And as we talk to a customer, we don’t sell them a technology, we understand what their needs are and inside a customer, every department, every user has an individual need. So the marketing department is going to want laser-based quality. They are going to be wanting really vibrant color when they print proposals, as same with sales inside Cathie and now Steve’s organization. They are a little more frugal and so they want to be able to see red and black, but we would like to see green on headlights, that’s good too, but it doesn’t require the same high-quality, you get incredible quality with ink, but just not that glossy kind of quality. And so that represents a really unique solution. That means that when we go to a customer we can provide this mix of hybrid solutions down to a departmental and individual basis that makes our offerings very unique and compelling. So that’s what we are focused on playing our game.
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Yes, thank you. Congrats on mine as well to you, Cathie. I guess two questions. First one when I think about the commentary you guys have on supplies for next year being, I think flat to slightly up? I understand you don’t want to breakdown the delta or kind of breakdown the delta between HP and S-Print, but the supplies commentary would suggest that your installed base is perhaps declining at a faster rate today post S-Print versus what it was before? Is that a fair assumption to take away from your commentary for supplies in fiscal ‘19 and if so when do you see the installed base starting to normalize as you go forward?
Cathie Lesjak: Amit, the core HP installed base, I don’t think is declining at a faster rate, but clearly, the S-Print portfolio will decline at a faster rate and part of that’s because of that nature of the units that S-Print put into the markets, but also because we have rationalized SKUs and that’s why it’s not meaningful to talk about S-Print separately from HP, because they are one in the same, the better job we do at integrating, the better value for our investors and the fact to the matter is you can’t separate the two.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. I guess maybe I am trying to get a sense of when do you think the combined installed base starts to normalize and have the same trajectory that maybe HP did a year ago? And maybe just my follow-up by the way, how do you think about FX within your guidance for the full year given the fact you have had some fairly volatile consumables as of late?
Cathie Lesjak: So, I think I take you back to the security analyst meeting, where we talked about kind of what we thought was going to happen at the home, the office and the graphics level in terms of the four-box model. I think that’s probably the place to go. So, from a home perspective, we did expect that the installed base would continue to decline, that from an office prospective we thought the installed base with the addition of A3 would be flat, and that from a graphics prospective we thought the installed base would be up. And that gives you a sense of what’s happening from an installed base, our expectations from an installed base perspective.
Dion Weisler: I think we continue to successfully execute those growth initiatives, but it takes time and we had certainly expected it to take time as we enter into a new $55 billion business, the A3 business, where we have very low market share, we know that it is going to take time to develop that business, but we remain really confident that we will achieve the 12% market share that we set out to achieve by 2020.
Cathie Lesjak: And I think it’s important when we talk about S-Print that you separate the A3 business which was a very small part of the Samsung print business. It was really all about the future technology that future with their technology and it’s the A4 piece of the S-Print business that we talk about on the installed base coming down pretty significantly and to Dion’s point as expected.
Amit Daryanani: And you might want to answer the second question on FX?
Cathie Lesjak: I am sorry can you remind me the question on FX?
Amit Daryanani: Yes, Cathie. I was just trying to get a sense on how you think about FX and the impact of FX, which has been fairly volatile baked into your July guidance for the full year guide?
Cathie Lesjak: Sure. So FX has been very unpredictable and when we think about where the dollar is trading today, we think about revenue kind of the impact of revenue as a result of FX for the total year would be approximately 2 points and obviously most of that impact – the vast majority of that impact was happening in the first half.
Operator: And the last questioner for today will be Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much and Cathie you will be missed and the great results and outlook. My question is Cathie, [Technical Difficulty] investment into the Print business. Can you specify was that equal amongst S-Print and your core typical prints or more on the graphics side or the 3D print side, the supply side and maybe allocate – maybe just talk about where these incremental investments are being allocated? Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: So, Jim, the biggest impact to FX was the addition of S-Print in the portfolio from a year-over-year perspective. But as I mentioned, we did make incremental investments in R&D and go-to-market and those are along the initiatives that frankly we have been talking about now for several quarters in A3 figures prominently in that, especially along the go-to-market lines. In terms of the specifics of how much is in the core, in the A3 space, S-Print, graphics, we don’t typically go into that level of detail, but I would say that you think about the initiatives that we have for growth and that’s going to help drive you to where the OpEx investments are being made.
Jim Suva: Great. Thanks so much for the clarification and detail.
Dion Weisler: Great. Well, thank you. We are at the top of the hour. I’d like to reiterate that that I am very pleased with the results of the quarter, but as always, there is more work to do. We never stop. We remain confident in our strategy and our ability to grow. Our reinvention is paying off. And I believe our best is yet to come. And finally, I again want to thank Cathie for her incredible partnership and I look forward to having Steve here on the call next quarter and to speak to you all then. Thanks so much.
Operator: And the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2018 Q1  (2018-02-22 17:35:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2018 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is William, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. 
 I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host for today's call, Steve Fieler, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed. 
Steve Fieler: Good afternoon. I'm Steve Fieler, head of treasury for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2018 first quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. 
 Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of this webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. 
 As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
 We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018, and HP's other SEC filings. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. 
 And now I'll hand it over to Dion. 
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 
 Right out of the gate, we're off to a strong start for the fiscal year. A great quarter of double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth year-over-year speaks to our ability to deliver consistent and sustained momentum across our portfolio and across regions. To echo what I've said many times, we're playing our own game, delivering operational excellence, predictable shareholder returns and prioritizing profitable growth. And we're doing this while building the business for the long term and investing in our core growth and future strategic framework. 
 And while our strategy remains consistent, every day, we are improving and refining our business and go-to-market execution. We are engineering some of the best innovations in our history to enhance value for our customers and partners. We're evolving business models to match changing customer needs and market realities, and we're constantly looking for ways to improve our overall cost structure, and it's working. 
 Quarter 1 was impressive across many dimensions. We delivered another quarter of top line growth year-over-year with net revenue up 14% to $14.5 billion and growth across all 3 regions in both Personal Systems and Print. We drove bottom line growth as well in Personal Systems and Print with year-over-year increases in operating profit dollars. 
 We delivered $0.48 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share, up $0.10 compared to Q1 of last year. Even when you adjust for the tax rate benefit from U.S. tax reform, we earned $0.44 in Q1, up 16% year-over-year and above our previously guided range of $0.40 to $0.43. And we delivered nearly $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and returned 71% of it to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 
 As you know, Congress passed the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our fiscal Quarter 1. HP supported tax reform and believes it will make the U.S. more globally competitive and help stimulate the economy. We expect tax reform to benefit HP's stakeholders and are planning for a lower go-forward effective tax rate. We believe this will help us drive higher net earnings, strengthen our balance sheet and increase our near-term shareholder return opportunities. 
 We expect it will also create capacity for us to invest in our business, including incremental investments in our workforce. We intend to use a portion of our annual tax savings to invest back into our nonexecutive employees by increasing their ongoing annual variable performance bonus opportunity. Cathie will walk you through more details on U.S. tax reform in her remarks. 
 Now let me cover HP's segment performance. Personal Systems had a terrific start to FY '18. Net revenue grew 15% year-over-year, marking 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. Let me repeat: 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit revenue growth. And this quarter comes on top of 10% growth in Q1 of FY '17 versus the prior year. We also achieved the trifecta: share gains, revenue gains and profit dollar growth. Congratulations to this team for a stellar job. 
 Performance was strong and broad based across all segments, product categories and regions. We achieved double-digit growth in Consumer and Commercial in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations, and in the Americas, EMEA and APJ. Personal Systems continues to deliver strong financial results, unrivaled innovation and, ultimately, is shaping the future of personal computing. 
 Underpinning our market success is amazing design, innovation and a consistent focus on leveraging customer insights to create and deliver experiences that amaze. But it's not just us saying we have the most innovative product lineup. At January's Consumer Electronics Show, we took home 77 awards for innovation. And despite being a consumer show, our awards recognized our Consumer and Commercial lineup as we continue to design for OneLife, products at the intersection of home, work and mobile. 
 We introduced convertible PCs, such as the latest 15-inch Spectre x360, and new innovations like HP Pavilion Wave that brings Amazon Alexa to a powerful compact desktop. And we showcase continued leadership and security and manageability with products like the updated EliteBook 800 series. 
 In gaming, we continue to be well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities with our OMEN lineup. We announced enhanced streaming in these powerhouse products, including the incredible OMEN X big format gaming display with NVIDIA G-SYNC. 
 And as the market accelerates with a service-led economy, our Device as a Service solutions continue to gain traction. Last week, we announced DaaS offerings to Apple devices to support our multi-OS leadership. Device as a Service supports our customers with the ability to drive efficiencies, free up capital and IT resources, and improve employee experience with technology. 
 Our focus on providing incredible experiences to our partners and customers contributed to market share gains. In calendar Quarter 4, the PC market grew both in units and revenue. We outpaced the market growth in every region, extending our #1 unit market share to 23.5%, up 1.7 points year-over-year. As we've said before, market share continues to be an outcome of great innovation and operational excellence, not an objective. 
 Much like Personal Systems, the Print business is off to a fantastic start. In Q1, we grew revenue and operating profit and placed more good units. And we did this irrespective of the addition of our Samsung Print transaction. Total Print revenue was up 14% year-over-year with growth across Consumer hardware, Commercial hardware and Supplies. We're seeing growth across all regions and broadly across the business. As I've talked about, we are reinventing how the world experiences Print, and the business is more relevant than ever. 
 Supplies revenue grew 10% year-over-year, marking another quarter of substantial progress and supporting our confidence in the Four Box Model to drive health in the Print business for the long term. 
 Let me highlight a few areas of Print progress as part of our growth strategy. Graphics revenue grew year-over-year largely driven by Indigo and PageWide presses. Managed Print Services revenue grew year-over-year as businesses continued to shift to contractual printing. In IDC's most recent report on the smart multifunction print market, HP was the recognized leader for both A4 and A3 across laser and PageWide. IDC recognized HP as the #1 vendor in both capability and strategy. 
 And in A3, we're gaining market share both year-over-year and sequentially. In Quarter 1, we added an important new functionality to our A3 PageWide products for the Enterprise with low-cost color, maximum uptime and best-in-class security. And we're excited to have closed the Samsung Print acquisition as of November 1, 2017, that we'll now call S-Print going forward. We have now created a larger Print family, which will help us address the $55 billion A3 market opportunity along with adding capabilities and revenue in A4. The integration efforts and key initiatives are on track. We're joining teams, combining our product portfolios, onboarding new partners, rationalizing SKUs and streamlining processes. 
 Q1 also marked more milestones for our 3D Printing business. Earlier this month, we introduced a lower-cost color solution that, for the first time in the industry, creates engineering-grade prototype, functional parts in black or a full spectrum of color, including white. This opens up a whole new TAM, and importantly, we're now the only 3D printing provider that enables both prototyping and industrial final part production on the same underlying technology platform. 
 We also introduced a future collaboration with Dassault Systèmes, a world leader in 3D design software to unlock new voxel-level possibilities for product developers. And we continue to grow within our key verticals and add new customers, such as FedEx and the U.S. Marine Corps. 
 Overall, I'm very pleased with our Q1 results and the vitality of our business. But as always, we have more work to do. We are never satisfied, and we'll continue to build on HP's strong foundation and incredible opportunities ahead. Every day is a new opportunity to embrace change, accelerate our thinking and deliver for the market and for our customers. 
 We're leading in the core with sprinkles of magic across our portfolio. We've entered adjacent markets with disruptive IP and strategies where we can provide differentiation and accelerate industry shifts. And we're investing in our future, creating categories with potential upside for decades to come. 
 We're also investing in lending our voice to what makes HP an important company in the world, from sustainability and the environment to diversity and inclusion, we believe it's not just what we do but how we do it. Deep in our DNA, we believe in leveraging the power of the company to benefit societies and the communities in which we operate. These efforts underpin our business focus and our corporate values. This is a very exciting time to be at HP. 
 Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and our financial outlook. 
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. We delivered strong results in Q1 with impressive revenue growth and year-over-year increases in operating profit dollars, free cash flow and earnings per share. 
 Before getting into specific Q1 performance, I want to first provide some context on tax reform and its impact on our results. There are many broad and complex elements to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that require extensive tax analysis, much of which is ongoing as government authorities share further clarifying publications. We expect additional details to be available in the months ahead, so on today's call, I'll highlight the largest impact areas and provisional adjustment. I'll then later summarize the combination of these impacts in our financial outlook. 
 For starters, we recorded a noncash tax-related accounting gain of $1.1 billion in our Q1 GAAP-only results. This $1.1 billion gain is a net number, inclusive of the expected repatriation transition tax charge and other net accounting benefits. Under the new tax code, U.S. companies are required to pay a repatriation transition tax on offshore earnings that have not been previously repatriated to the U.S. We booked a gross repatriation charge of $3.2 billion with payments to be made over the published 8-year schedule. However, the actual cash payments will likely be much lower as we expect to reduce the overall liability by more than half once existing and future credits and other balance sheet attributes are used. 
 We've also recorded a net $4.3 billion accounting benefit in the quarter, which more than offsets the gross repatriation tax. This provisional adjustment is a result of reversing previously accrued-upon earnings from foreign subsidiaries, which are netted against revaluing our deferred tax assets and liabilities at a lower 21% U.S. tax rate. 
 In Q1, we also saw a positive impact on our effective tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 15% compared to our previously provided guidance range of 21% to 22%. The 6.5 point tax rate delta generated approximately $0.04 of non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the quarter. 
 With this context in mind, let me now cover the Q1 results. Net revenue was $14.5 billion, up 14% year-over-year as reported or 13% in constant currency. And our performance remained strong across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year, Americas grew 10%, EMEA was up 13% and APJ grew 18%, all in constant currency. Gross margin of 17.8% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improved rate in Printing, partially offset by higher commodity cost in Personal Systems. Gross margins were down 30 basis point sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.6 billion were up 17% year-over-year or 5% sequentially driven by the addition of S-Print along with incremental R&D and go-to-market investments to support growth. 
 Net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 15% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.48 or $0.44 when adjusting for the previously estimated 21% to 22% tax rate compared to the 15% recorded. 
 Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $31 million, acquisition-related charges of $42 million, amortization of intangible assets of $20 million, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $56 million and the related tax impact on these charges. Most significantly, we recorded a provisional $1.1 billion net gain for the adjustments resulting from the U.S. tax reform. In Q1, GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $1.16. 
 Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue remained very strong, delivering $9.4 billion, up 15% year-over-year as reported or 13% in constant currency. The results continue to be broad based, reflecting our innovative product portfolio and global execution. 
 By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 13% and Commercial revenue was up 16% year-over-year. By product category, Notebooks were up 14%, Desktops up 17% and Workstations up 11% year-over-year. 
 Personal Systems operating profit dollars grew year-over-year and operating margin was 3.6% in the quarter, which is down 20 basis points sequentially and year-over-year. We saw industry-wide increases in component costs again in Q1 driven primarily by DRAM, which continues to put pressure on margin. We now expect to see increased component costs throughout FY '18 and, therefore, are mitigating via pricing, supply chain scale and leveraging our balance sheet, driving positive mix shifts and currency favorability. Together, these actions should enable us to offset some of the commodity cost increases. 
 Before turning to Printing, let me add a little more color on S-Print since our financials include a full quarter of results. As a reminder, last quarter, we updated our full year FY '18 guidance to include the operational impact of the acquisition. We estimated $1.4 billion of revenue and added $0.01 of non-GAAP net earnings per share to our full year outlook. 
 We highlighted that, as expected, S-Print's hardware and Supplies revenue base was in decline driven by low-end A-4 products. We also describe that S-Print would be in investment mode during the first half of the fiscal year, putting pressure on overall Print margins before becoming profitable during the second half. 
 It's important to reemphasize that we intend to integrate the business across the globe as quickly as possible. This is fundamental to our value-creation plan and includes rationalizing SKUs with 25% of Samsung-branded SKUs already reduced by the end of Q1, combining the respective Samsung and HP-branded products into an integrated portfolio for our collective sales force, and transitioning the S-Print installed base into the HP sales model. The faster we integrate, the quicker we create value, and this is exactly our plan. 
 A direct result of this integration strategy is that we are unable to accurately size organic versus inorganic hardware units or revenue results. Said differently, depending on the actual tradeoffs already being made in the field, the additional $1.4 billion of acquisition revenue in FY '18 may indeed come from either Samsung or HP-branded SKUs. 
 From a reporting perspective, we have included all S-Print hardware in Commercial hardware revenue and units since the integration is being led by our office business. As a result, there is no impact to Consumer hardware revenue or units at this time. In the future, we may realign these SKU-level results depending on the organizational ownership at that time. 
 Now getting back to Printing performance. Revenue was $5.1 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year or up over $600 million. We're very pleased with this growth with or without the impact from S-Print. Total hardware units were up 14% year-over-year with Consumer units up 7% and Commercial units up 73%. In calendar Q4, overall Print unit share was 38%, down 2 points year-over-year. 
 Moving to Q1 Supplies performance. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 10% year-over-year, which includes approximately 6 points of S-Print supplies. We do not anticipate breaking out S-Print's specific Supplies results in future quarters due to the integration progress that has already been made and, specifically, the impact that hardware unit placements in Q1 would have on future supplies. 
 Overall, our Supplies results reflect our sustained efforts around stabilizing supplies and an easier year-over-year compare. We believe that the Four Box Model remains a good predictor of our Supplies performance, and we continue to operate below our channel inventory ceiling. We're in the early days of A3 but remain confident and optimistic about the opportunity ahead. An important marker for success of A3 and for our S-Print acquisition is making steady progress towards our goal of achieving at least 12% market share of A3 hardware units by the end of fiscal '20. 
 In calendar Q4, we achieved 7.9% total share, including both S-Print and HP. We also continue to make progress in our contractual offerings, including good momentum with Instant Ink, where we are growing our global subscriber base. 
 Print operating profit dollars grew $87 million year-over-year, and operating margin was 15.8% in the quarter, down 20 basis points year-over-year and 80 basis point sequentially. The largest driver of the margin decline is the impact of adding S-Print. We expect that our Q1 operating margin rate will be the low for the year. 
 Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $996 million and free cash flow was $977 million in the quarter. We finished Q1 with a $1.2 billion net debt position, which includes the approximately $1 billion in funding for S-Print. Cash conversion cycle was minus 27 days, which weakened 3 days sequentially driven by an 8-day decrease in days payable outstanding, offset by a 2-day decrease in days sales outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. We have been deliberately building our owned inventory and accounts payable balance steadily in FY '17 and specifically in Q4 as we leveraged our balance sheet to address rising component costs and to support growth. In Q1, we typically adjust these balances down for seasonality, and we shifted more this year, given the higher beginning balances. 
 During Q1, we had a total capital return of $692 million through $462 million in share repurchases and $230 million in cash dividends. With tax reform, our long-term capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. However, we will now have the opportunity to more efficiently access our global cash and run the business with lower levels of cash on the balance sheet. We are still finalizing the specific timing and quantity of repatriated cash, and we'll update you more in the months to come. 
 In addition to supporting operating cash needs, our priorities for using this cash are, first, ensuring that we maintain our existing investment-grade credit rating. We plan to reduce our gross debt levels, taking into consideration our resulting net debt position after repatriation, the tax repatriation, cash liability and share repurchases. 
 Second, opportunistically returning capital to shareholders with a focus on incremental share repurchase. Third, investing in our nonexecutive workforce as Dion described. And finally, we're not changing our disciplined and returns-based approach to capital allocation, including M&A. 
 Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook: In Personal Systems, we now expect that the overall cost of components driven primarily by memory will continue to increase throughout FY '18. This headwind and any net impact on repricing will ultimately depend upon actual market demand and competitive dynamics, including offsets from gross currency benefits. 
 In Printing, we expect that Samsung-branded supplies continue to decrease due to declines in the historical installed base. Overall, we expect that total Supplies revenue, inclusive of both legacy HP and S-Print, to be up 5% to 7% in constant currency for the aggregate remainder of FY '18. Looking forward to FY '19, we expect the overall Supplies business to be flat to slightly up in constant currency. In addition, we expect to opportunistically place units with a positive NPV. 
 For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We also continue to look at opportunities to take cost out of the business, especially with the close of S-Print, overall commodity cost environment and the opportunity to expand the TAM of positive NPV units. We'll also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. 
 We have factored in the various tax reform implications in our full year non-GAAP outlook. We estimate our go-forward effective tax rate to be 16% plus or minus 2 points, which is improved from our previously guided FY '18 tax rate between 21% to 22%. This generates a full year diluted net earnings per share benefit of approximately $0.13, of which $0.04 has already been earned in Q1. 
 Importantly, the 16% rate plus or minus 2 points is a full year outlook. We are likely to see more quarterly variations to the rate just like we saw in the lower Q1 15% rate, which is now expected to create a sequential tax headwind in Q2. 
 Partially offsetting the $0.13 full year diluted net earnings per share tax benefit is an approximately $0.03 diluted net earnings per share investment during the remainder of the year to fund the higher variable performance bonus opportunities for nonexecutives, which will be recorded in the segment's operating results. Therefore, the net U.S. tax reform benefit is approximately $0.10 per share for the full year with approximately a $0.02 benefit in each remaining quarter in FY '18. 
 From a GAAP-only perspective, our guidance now includes an incremental noncash $20 million charge per quarter for amortization of intangibles related to the S-Print acquisition. We have not assumed other GAAP-only adjustments related to the U.S. tax act other than the onetime $1.1 billion accounting gain already recorded in Q1. However, our tax analysis is ongoing and tax guidance is still being regularly clarified by government authorities, which may impact our go-forward tax model or accounting and, therefore, result in future adjustments. 
 With all that in mind, we expect Q2 '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.45 to $0.49, including the $0.02 net benefit from U.S. tax reform. Q2 '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. 
 We are raising our full year fiscal '18 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by $0.15, including the $0.10 net benefit from U.S. tax reform. The range is now $1.90 to $2. And our full year fiscal '18 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $2.53 to $2.63. 
 Before transitioning to Q&A, I want to update you on prospective changes to our earnings calendar. We're looking to move our earnings calls in future quarters closer to the date of quarterly or annual reports with the SEC. The changes in the number of dates will depend on the specific quarter, and we'll continue to announce our earnings call dates about 2 weeks prior to each call. 
 I know there are a few new and somewhat complicated topics that we covered, so let me briefly summarize our quarter. We had impressive revenue growth and year-over-year operating profit dollar expansion across both segments with or without S-Print. We continue to make progress executing our core growth and future strategy. And we're investing in the business for the long term and, at the same time, committing to return capital to shareholders. 
 With that, let's open up the call for questions. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questioner today will be Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. 
Amit Daryanani: I have 2 questions, I guess. Maybe the first 1 to start with, when I think about the 4% organic Supplies that you guys talked about in Q1, could you just maybe help connect that with the expectation that fiscal '18 will be flat to slightly up in Supplies, what do you guys see in the Four Box Model, I guess, that gives you pause that the trend you saw in Q1 doesn't sustain on an organic basis in Supplies? 
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Amit. But let me just make sure it's clear what I said in my remarks because, what we said is that in -- for Q2 to Q4, we expect that the Supplies growth in constant currency would be 5% to 7%. That includes the Samsung-branded Supplies impact. And the way we came to that number, and this is really helping all of you have a milestone at which to measure us against, and that's that we took the base plan for HP core for FY '18 that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, which was basically flat to slightly up in constant currency. And we layered into that, on top of that, the S-Print Supplies before the integration begins -- began, okay. And the result is that when you look at that on a year-to-year basis, it's 5% to 7% for Q2 to Q4. As you appropriately talked about in Q1, we were up 10%. We have about 6 points of Samsung-branded Supplies in Q1, and that's probably the only quarter in which it's a real clear inorganic piece that we can calculate. I'm sorry, are there other people hearing that? Hold on, you guys. We have music coming in. We're not quite sure why. 
Amit Daryanani: That sounds to be coming from the main speaker line 
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, maybe. Okay, sorry about that. So in Q1, 10% year-over-year Supplies growth, 6 points with Samsung-branded Supplies. And again, this was the first and only quarter we're really going to get a clean view of Samsung Supplies because those Supplies in Q1 really came from the preacquisition installed base. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have had SKU rationalization of about 25% of the S-Print SKUs have been reduced. And so going forward, some of what would have been originally considered part of a increasing install base for S-Print hardware is now really going to be HP. So there's not a clear cut. But in Q1, there wasn't that list that's with 4% of organic Supplies growth year-over-year. 
Dion Weisler: So let me just add, Amit, that we have really high confidence in the Four Box Model and the team's ability to drive improvements in each element of each of the 4 boxes. I think, Enrique and the regional presidents -- Nick, Christoph, Richard -- and the teams did a great job in stabilizing Supplies earlier than expected last year. I have confidence in the team's ability to deliver a successful integration of the S-Print business going forward so that our total Supplies business is flat to slightly up next year and the Four Box Model is delivering as predicted. 
Amit Daryanani: Got it. And if I could just follow up on the Personal Systems side. Again, overall revenue number is fairly impressive here, especially given the tough compares you guys have. Can you just maybe -- -- when you look at the performance there, what is enabling that? Is it share gain? Or is it end demand in PCs doing better? And I guess, your confidence that there isn't a channel build that's happening at this point in that segment. 
Dion Weisler: Well, I'm happy to kind of give you the bigger picture. And Cathie, if you want to give some tactical data points for the in-quarter numbers to the team, that would be helpful. I tend to remind folks every quarter this is still a massive $334 billion market, half of which is traditional hardware. And while 1 in 5 have an HP logo on it, I always remind our sales folks that 4 out of 5 potential customers are missing out on experiencing HP's magic. And so I like this market. I've always liked this market. I've been pretty consistent about that. I think we got the best portfolio in our history. It keeps on getting better, which is why we grew at a 7-point premium to the market last quarter, and I think we've shown that we can consistently do that. And while share gains are not the objective, we see upside in the outcome of engineering experiences that amaze. We're playing our own game. We're shifting our portfolio towards more profitable parts of the market, and we're taking share where we want to, and we're not taking share for share's sake. Our channel inventory continues to be well managed. I'm very confident that our strategy of innovation, of cost management, the team's ability to execute positions us well, not only for today but also well into the future. 
Catherine Lesjak: And Amit, if you look at what's going on in the market from a PC perspective, we are starting to see some signs of improved PC growth, both in calendar Q3 and in calendar Q4. We did see growth in units and revenue, although I will say the analysts are predicting that units will be down in traditional PCs this year with revenue roughly flattish. Some of the dynamics that are going on, our ASPs are up. They're up because we've been repricing -- we and the market -- the rest of the market have been repricing for commodity cost increases. But they're also up because we're getting a really nice mix shift to higher-end products, higher price, better margins. And so that is also helping with kind of revenue versus units. But we have seen some signs of life in Personal Systems. 
Operator: Our next questioner today will be Steve Milunovich with UBS. 
Steven Milunovich: You had a good cash flow quarter once again. And yet, you didn't raise the $3 billion-plus target. Was free cash flow above what you expected? And why couldn't we expect a higher number for the full year? 
Catherine Lesjak: So we're very pleased with the free cash flow this quarter. And it is pretty atypical for us to update our free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, so we are still at, at least $3 billion. That being said, there is -- we are starting to see some upside in that number. But keep in mind that free cash flow is really driven by earnings, obviously, but also what happens to the cash conversion cycle and also the business mix. And when we look at those components, we still -- we feel very confident in the at least $3 billion in free cash flow for the year. 
Steven Milunovich: Okay. And then I think you were looking for an improved Personal Systems margin as you go into the second half, figuring the comparison's improved. And maybe at the time, you were thinking that DRAM prices weren't going to rise. Should we still see an increasing Personal Systems margin in the second half? And to what degree does this new view on DRAM impact that? 
Catherine Lesjak: So let's start first with kind of our expectations around commodity cost, and they have changed. So if we go back to the Security Analyst Meeting, we really thought that they would start to level off, and we're kind of at the levels that they would stay at. And we have seen continued increase in fiscal Q1 for us, particularly in DRAM. And we now expect that to continue throughout the year. In terms of margin, we definitely saw ASP increases, again as a result of pricing that we've taken over the last year, mix, positive mix and currency. But that just wasn't enough to offset the commodity cost increases that we've seen, and so we are basically down 20 basis points year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter. But one of the things I will ask you to just think through, mathematically, if we were able to offset 100% of our commodity cost increases but not generate any incremental profit on these commodity cost increases, it would be dilutive to margin. And the numbers that we're coming up with is somewhere between 15 and 20 basis points is the headwind, simply if we were able to 100% reprice for commodity costs, which we have not been able to do. 
Dion Weisler: And let me give you just some additional longer-term context as we discussed at SAM, our mix shifts and our relentless focus on cost will continue, but we will also see a positive evolution of operating profit dollars and margin, which we expect to happen in the medium to longer term as we do that mix shift. Remember, half of that $334 billion market is not in the traditional hardware. It's in other things like services and more profitable parts of the market, and we are mix shifting towards that over time. And as a result, we raised the high end of our range to 5% at the Security Analyst Meeting, and we feel confident in our strategy and in our ability to transform the portfolio over time. 
Catherine Lesjak: So we were in the 3% to 4% historical range. We think that we will remain in that range for the rest of the year. But keep in mind that we also -- we go after any revenue that isn't dilutive to our margins, and it would be really a mistake for us to just focus on rate and not on operating profit dollars because, ultimately, it's operating profit dollars that are going to generate cash flow long term. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. 
Wamsi Mohan: Dion, now that you've had the Samsung portfolio for over a quarter, has anything surprised you in the business? And do you anticipate making any changes to the rate or pace of investments needed there? And can you just give us some context. Has this Intel chip flaw had any impact on demand? Or do you anticipate any uptick in demand from that? And I have a quick follow-up for Cathie. 
Dion Weisler: Sure. Look, I would say the S-Print integration is going according to plan. We moved the head of our office Print business. He relocated to Korea with his family last year to oversee the process and the business, so we've got people from our traditional business inside the S-Print business and vice versa. We've combined our R&D orgs. We've created a new center of excellence in Korea. Remember that we added more than 1,000 incredible R&D engineers into the HP family and more than 6,500 patents. So I would say it's -- we're 1 quarter in and the business is operating as expected, and it's providing us with the opportunity to really accelerate our progress in the A3 $55 billion market, where we've been underpenetrated. So I feel good about that. The second question was... 
Wamsi Mohan: On the Intel chip flow. 
Dion Weisler: Intel. No, I don't think we've seen a broad reaction to the demand for PCs broadly or for the Intel platform. Obviously, we work very hard to make sure that we're providing the appropriate updates. Security is incredibly important to us and to our customers, and I think we're on the front foot there, reacting faster than all of our competitors. But I don't believe it's made a broad impact to demand. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. 
Kathryn Huberty: Two questions from me. The first is where do you think copier share could exit this fiscal year? And then when will the A3 market begin to pull through noticeable aftermarket revenue and really have some impact on Supplies? And then I'll ask my follow-up. 
Catherine Lesjak: So Katie, from a -- A3 hardware share perspective, as you know, our goal is to hit at least 12% in FY '20. And we had 7.9% share in the last calendar quarter and up both year-on-year and sequentially. So we're feeling confident and optimistic about what we can do in the copier space. The kind of reception from customers has been positive, and so it does take a little bit of time, with such a big transactional business that we have, for it to have a meaningful impact, but we are making progress. 
Dion Weisler: We continue to sign new channel partners. The pipeline is growing consistently in every single region. So this is obviously an area that we spend a lot of time. It is, again, a $55 billion market. We've been underpenetrated for a long time. We're making progress. More work to do and we're on track. 
Kathryn Huberty: Is there any meaningful Supplies impact yet? Or is that still to come from A3? 
Catherine Lesjak: It's not meaningful at this point in time. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. 
Toni Sacconaghi: I have one for Dion and one for Cathie. Dion, I'm just trying to reconcile maybe qualitatively more than anything sort of the forces at work on Supplies. So Supplies organically have grown better than 2% for each of the last 3 quarters. And all the leading indicators sound good. The graphics business is growing. MPS is growing. You've commented for the last several quarters about placing profitable units. A3 is ramping. All of those would kind of suggest that Supplies actually should improve going forward. And yet, the guidance for fiscal '19 appears that it may be softer than what we've seen in recent quarters. So are there some offsetting takes that we're missing? Or how do we sort of square the circle here? 
Catherine Lesjak: Toni, so maybe I'll take that one. There are some forces outside of the core HP Supplies business in Samsung. Their installed base is continuing to come down pretty significantly, and their installed base is mostly low-end A4 laser and just not pulling the attach. And so we will, in FY '19, be flat to slightly up in constant currency. And I think that that's not inconsistent with what we've been talking about in last year or this year when you look at the easy compare that we had. 
Dion Weisler: I mean, it's not a surprise to us, I guess, is what Cathie's saying. We contemplated it. It was fed as an input into the Four Box Model, and the Four Box Model has been the strong predictor of outcomes for us. And as a result of that, we believe that Supplies in '19 will be flat to slightly up. 
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just a follow-up. Cathie, currency has moved much more favorably since you provided your SAM guidance. Wouldn't that be an incremental tailwind to both revenue and EPS? And can you help quantify that for us? And then should we expect a 16% tax rate beyond fiscal '18? 
Catherine Lesjak: So let's start with the last question first. Yes, we expected in FY '19 our tax rate will be 16% plus or minus 2% so in line with FY '18. In terms of FX, you're right. At the time of SAM, we thought that the tailwind to revenue is going to be 1 to 2 points. With kind of exchange rates now, it's more like 2 to 3 points. And we saw in Q1, basically, 1.7 points worth of tailwind. But we also are starting -- are seeing basically commodity cost increases. And so that is basically being offset somewhat by the tailwind that we're seeing on the currency side. And then also just the pressure in the market. It's a very competitive market. The competitive dynamics are such that there is pressure to basically reprice. And so the combination of the commodity cost increase and the repricing assumptions basically say that the tailwind from currency in FY '18 versus '17 is still about 6 points -- $0.06. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Jim Suva with Citi. 
Jim Suva: One question for Cathie and then one for Dion. For Cathie, the operating margins in Print segment, which went down, I believe, about 20% -- 20 basis points year-over-year. Is that solely attributable to the Samsung integration or investing or something else? And then for Dion, with average selling prices of PCs going higher, are you seeing a average life of the PC be extended even more? Or what's your view on the current installed base average life of the PC going forward? 
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with the Print margins. There are a few factors to consider. The first one is what you mentioned, and that's that S-Print, we have a full quarter of S-Print since we closed this transaction on November 1. And as we talked about on the last earnings call, S-Print is in investment mode in Q1 and, frankly, the first half of the year. And so that, of course, is diluting not only margins but also operating profit dollars. And that's probably one of the big impacts to the 15.8% versus the 16.6% that we saw last quarter. The second one is the NPV positive unit placement. We have seen a significant increase sequentially relative to normal seasonality with unit placements. And of course, we all know that you've got to place the units in order to get the recurring revenue on Supplies. So at this point in time, we do expect that the 15.8% will be the low point in the year since Samsung will help because it will continually improve over the course of the year. 
Dion Weisler: And on the second question, I'd say broadly speaking, there's quite a few forces acting on the pretty aged install base of Personal Systems today, given it's sort of about 5-plus years for the most part. But we see tablets down. We see mobile phones under pressure. And that's creating capacity for investment in other areas. And in the Personal Systems category, due in large part to the kind of innovation that we've been driving, we've been giving people a reason to upgrade. If you look at a PC of 5 years ago, it's probably unrecognizable from the products that we make today. 
Catherine Lesjak: It's ugly. 
Dion Weisler: It's ugly, yes. Unrecognizable. And as a result of that, I think we're not quite sure whether it remains at 5 years or whether it moves to 4 or it goes to 5.5, I think a lot of that depends on us as innovators. How can we keep an innovation engine alive that is giving customers a reason to update their equipment? What else is it going to do for their businesses? What else is it going to do for their personal lives? So we spend a lot of time thinking about how we can not only invigorate the different categories but how we can invent new categories. And it's incumbent, I think, on the industry to provide customers with a reason to upgrade. 
Operator: And our next questioner today will be Shannon Cross with Cross Research. 
Shannon Cross: Just one and then a follow-up. In terms of subscription services, I'm curious how do we think about the percent of your revenue that's now under contracts and recurring. I assume most of it's sort of weighted to Printing, but I'm also curious as to how Device as a Service for PCs is being received by customers. 
Catherine Lesjak: So maybe I'll start with kind of the contractual business as a percentage of our total business, and then Dion can handle how it's progressing. The contractual element is there. It's happening but it's relatively slow and gradual. We're pleased with the progress, but in terms of it having a meaningful impact on our top line or our bottom line, it's just going to take quite a bit longer. It's just not -- it's not that meaningful at this point in time. It is an important trend for our business both in Print as well as in Personal Systems because it does create an opportunity to drive incremental profit. 
Dion Weisler: And if you -- if we think more broadly about the big mega trends affecting societies, there is very clear evidence that markets are going to shift more from transactional motions to contractual motions where they value Everything as a Service. And so the investments that we're making in not only our Managed Print Services but in really very innovative Device as a Service offerings plays out over time. And to Cathie's point, as a percentage of revenue today, it's relatively small. The interest we see from customers to move to Everything as a Service and big customers, small customers and everything in between, is quite large. There's about a 6-point shift happening from transactional to contractual, and it varies country by country. But again, it's up to us to innovate in these markets served. The different types of customers, Gen Zs really want Everything as a Service, and we think we've got an incredibly exciting portfolio in that area. It's a great part of our pipeline going forward, both in terms of product innovation but also in terms of real sales funnel. 
Catherine Lesjak: And one of the big announcements that we made this past few weeks, I think, was really related to now us bringing Apple devices or being able to service Apple devices within a Device as a Service offering. And this is important because, in order to really do that well, you have to be multi-OS. You can't just be kind of your own product set. And so that's an additional kind of move forward for us. 
Dion Weisler: And Shannon, you know that well from Managed Print Services. You often walk into a company that has a fleet of many different vendors. And if you're going to be successful in Managed Print Services, you have to be able to take over the entire fleet regardless of where it comes from. The same is true for Personal Systems, and the strategic hook-up with Apple was a very important component to enable us -- to be able to service Apple devices as part of managed Device as a Service contract. 
Shannon Cross: Great. And then I think we've gotten through this call until now and not talked about 3D Printing. So I'm just curious as to what kind of update you can give there and what you're seeing from customers. 
Dion Weisler: So we remain very excited about the 3D Printing business. We laid out markers that we wanted you guys to continue to check back with us at the Security Analyst Meeting. One of those was the product portfolio. We said we were getting to full production -- full color, and we launched a low-cost prototyping product into the market a couple of weeks ago, which complements the production system that we already have. It's off the same platform technology, and that's really important as we get leverage from that single investment and pull it from a low-cost full-color platform all the way up to a full production system. We continue to make progress with our end customers with multiple repeat orders. We have continued to grow our channel. We continue to grow our materials partners. So that business is operating according to our plan, and we remain excited about its ability to tap into the $12 trillion manufacturing market over time. 
Catherine Lesjak: And I think there's 2 important points about that, the announcement with the low-price, full-color 3D printer. And one is Dion mentioned in his prepared remarks is that because it's the same platform, now for prototyping as well as production, that's unusual in the market. And so that's a draw. And then the other one is, over time, if we're really going to disrupt this $12 trillion manufacturing industry, we've got to get folks to design for 3D. It's not just replacing a part today that's injection molded. It's saying, is there a better way to design that part? And this lower-price printer is going to get placed in universities so that the new generation really starts thinking about designing from 3D right away. 
Operator: And our last questioner today will be Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. 
Roderick Hall: I wanted to come back to this idea of Supplies growth in 2019 flat to slightly up. And at the same time, your A3 share is growing. And just see if you can help us understand why continued growth in A3 share doesn't drive increase in Supplies since that's such a big part of the net income? And then I have a follow-up to that. 
Catherine Lesjak: So Rod, it's not that A3 doesn't provide some lift in Supplies in FY '19. It's the other factors that are offsetting the good unit placement, kind of the A3 growth that we're seeing. We are -- with S-Print, we have an installed base that is declining. We have Supplies on low-end A4 laser that just doesn't have the same sort of attach at that price band. And so what we're doing is we're offsetting some of those headwinds and are confident in our ability to have Supplies stable, flat to slightly up in constant currency in FY '19. 
Roderick Hall: And then I wanted to -- I wouldn't mind if you'd comment on when that sort of all that underlying movement on the negative side of that equation kind of stabilizes and when we are -- actually see it growing. And then the second question I had was just on NAND pricing. I wanted to check and see if your views there have changed? I know DRAM kind of makes sense to us. But just double checking that you're not also thinking NAND continues to increase through the year? And whether you've changed any thinking there. 
Catherine Lesjak: So Rod, in terms of Supplies, 1 year at a time or maybe 1.5 years at a time. We've now talked about '19. Stay tuned. At the end of '19, we'll talk about '20. 
Dion Weisler: And with regard to sort of memory, broadly, we know that DRAM is obviously a headwind. There are other components in the very broad basket of components that some move up, some move down. There may be some pressure from NAND. The biggest material impact is from DRAM, and that's what the teams are looking to obviously reprice wherever they can. We look to offset that through other items within the basket of costs as well as our own noncomponent costs within the business. We selectively leverage our balance sheet to secure inventory. We shouldn't forget that. You can't reprice what you don't have. Our Supplies value that consistency. The sustainable partner to smooth their cost investments is very important to them, and that drives a closer relationship to secure components at rational prices. And I think we've demonstrated our ability to do that. We'll always remain aggressive in our pursuit of other noncomponent cost takedowns. It's part of our DNA. It's wired into the way we work, and we'll continue to drive the mix shift to higher-priced, higher-margin segments as we laid it out at SAM. 
Catherine Lesjak: And we are getting a little bit of a tailwind obviously from currency that helps us in fiscal '18 to offset. 
Dion Weisler: But overall, I would say in closing out that I'm really pleased with the vitality of our business and our Q1 results. Very broad based. It's no one single pill inside the company. It's Printing. It's Personal Systems. It's Notebooks. It's desktops. It's home. It's office. Impressive revenue growth and year-to-year operating profit improvement delivering across the portfolio. We're leading in the core. We're accelerating our growth initiatives. And we're investing and continuing to invest in our future. We're never satisfied. We know there's much more work to do. We need to remain humble and continue to innovate and amaze our customers. We think we have an incredible opportunity to move even faster, embrace the change that's happening within the industry, accelerate our own thinking and deliver for our partners and our customers. And as I always say, our [ reinvention ] journey is just beginning. I'm convinced the best years lie ahead of us, and this year will be no exception. Thank you all. 
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you. 
Operator: And the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Dion Weisler: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It was great to see so many of you at our recent Security Analyst Meeting here in Palo Alto. Our results today echo what you heard from us, HP is strong and getting stronger. And my message to all of you is we’re just getting started. As I look at our performance in the quarter and for the full fiscal year, I’m pleased with our consistent execution, ability to grow revenue, generate cash flow, and invest in our future to create sustainable growth over time. It’s results like these that give us confidence in the trajectory of our business moving forward. It was just two years ago that we began our reinvention journey. We committed to compete and win in our core, into new growth markets and natural adjacencies, and invest in our future where we can disrupt industries and create new categories. We’re also committed to a relentless focus on productivity, to take cost out of the business. We did what we said we’d do, and I’m proud of the substantial progress we have made. There is more work to do, but we’ve never been more competitive, more fixated on the customer, more innovative, and more focused on operational excellence than we’re today. Let me review the highlights. We drove impressive topline growth with net revenue up 11% year-over-year to $13.9 billion including double-digit growth and share gains across the Americas, EMEA, and APJ. Both, Personal Systems and Printing grew year-over-year, together for the third consecutive quarter. We grew non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share year-over-year, delivering $0.44 for the quarter. We delivered $0.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, taking us to $3.3 billion for the full year. And we returned 69% of our FY17 free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, let me turn to segment performance. In quarter four, Personal Systems had another stellar quarter, driving growth, gaining profitable share, and delivering impressive innovations. This team is hitting their stride with truly outstanding performance. Personal Systems net revenue grew 13% year-over-year, which came on top of last year’s 4% growth in quarter four. For the full year we grew 11% year-over-year with double-digit growth in each of the past four quarters. Growth in Personal Systems continued to be broad-based with double-digit year-over-year revenue gains in consumer and commercial and across all three regions. We also saw consistent growth across product categories led by notebooks, and strong performance in desktops and workstations. Our regional leaders and sales partners are doing an incredible job of driving growth and delivering value for our customers. In calendar quarter three, the overall PC market returned to year-over-year growth both in units and revenue. We once again outperformed the PC unit market growth and increased our market share to 22.5%, up 1.2 points year-over-year. We saw year-over-year share gains continuing in each region in both consumer and commercial. In quarter four, we continue to surprise and delight the market with innovation. We announced our biggest premium launch across consumer and commercial, introduced the world’s most powerful and first detachable PC workstation, unleashed our most powerful OMEN X laptop for gaming athletes. And as you heard from us at SAM, we are doubling down on security with the world’s most secure and manageable commercial PCs. Security is built into our systems from the BIOS level and up, securing at, below, and above the operating system. As customer demands to services grows and the market transitions towards an on-demand based economy, we are gaining steady traction with enhanced devices or service offerings for the fleet management. We are seeing strong wins by our channel partners and a healthy pipeline for the future. Shifting to Printing. This business continues to make significant progress with year-over-year growth in revenue, operating profit and market share. In quarter four, total revenue was up 7% year-over-year with growth across all three geographic regions. We delivered year-over-year revenue increases in consumer hardware, commercial hardware and supplies. Quarter four supplies revenue grew again, demonstrating the huge progress we’ve made with this business during the year. Hardware units grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by consumer. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. Total print unit market share was 40% in calendar quarter three, and we gained share in both our office and home businesses. The graphics business continues to grow, even without the positive uplift that we experienced last year from the industry-wide drupa event. And as highlighted at the Security Analyst Meeting, we signed the single largest deal in our graphics history with Lightning Source. It’s a multimillion dollar, multiyear deal to deploy 24 PageWide digital presses to five printing sites on three continents. Lightning Source prints roughly 40% of the books sold through Amazon and this deal is going to help transform the distribution and sales model for book publishers all over the world. In A3, we continued to onboard new partners and gain market share, both year-over-year and sequentially. And I’m excited that on November the 1st, we closed the acquisition of Samsung’s Printing business. This creates a combined team, focused on innovation, acceleration and print excellence. Together, we are building on more than 30 years of print leadership and innovation, and now we have an unmatched portfolio and amazing technologies that will enable us to drive growth over time. As our two teams become one, we will preserve the best, the best talent, the best culture and the best technology to become better, stronger and faster. We’ve gained critical IP and now have a broad portfolio of laser and ink offerings that better positions us to attack the overall $55 billion A3 growth opportunity. And that also strengthens our A4 business. 2017 was a great year for 3D. We turned out 3D printing initiative into a business with global reach, repeat customer orders and expanding partner and materials ecosystem and revenue. This quarter, we continued to grow our business with new customers such as Medtronic, one of the largest medical device and service companies in the world. As previously highlighted, we As previously highlighted, we added more than 20 new partners including Henkel, our first worldwide reseller, and announced partnerships with Deloitte and Siemens to digitally transform manufacturing. Looking to 2018, we plan to introduce a new, lower cost full color system, allowing us to expand into new markets. We believe that Multi Jet Fusion will be the only 3D printing technology in the industry that can make mechanically robust, fully functional, color parts. Not only, are we leaders in polymers but we’re going to disrupt 3D printing with metals. Stay tuned for more news about this in the coming year. Overall, we’ve done what we said we would do. We’re growing the business, top line and bottom line, and generating strong cash flow. We’re delivering returns for our shareholders and investing in the future to create long-term value. I’m very pleased with our Q4 and FY17 results, but we always have more work to do for our customers, partners, employees and investors. Our markets remain highly competitive and our year-over-year compares are now much tougher, but we’re ready for it. I’m optimistic about our future and excited that we’re just getting started. I will now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details on our performance and our financial outlook.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. I’m very pleased that we have sustained the momentum achieved during our first three quarters of FY17 and drove strong Q4 results. We delivered net revenue of $13.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, as reported or 12% in constant currency. Our performance remained consistent across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year, Americas grew 10%, EMEA was up 11%, and APJ grew 16%, all in constant currency. Gross margin of 18.1% was down 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by segment mix with the higher commodity costs in Personal Systems partially being offset by the improved rate in Printing. Gross margins were down 50 basis points sequentially, driven by continued strength of Personal Systems revenue, combined with lower supplies mix and higher unit growth in Printing. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.5 billion were up 6% year-over-year and sequentially, driven by SG&A investments to support growth. Net OI&E expense was $65 million for the quarter. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.44. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $113 million and acquisition-related charges of $49 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of $34 million, tax indemnification credits of $23 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.39. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $9.1 billion, up 13% year-over-year as reported or 14% in constant currency. We’ve been delivering strong topline performance and are now beginning to lap tougher compares. By customer segment, consumer revenue was up 18% and commercial revenue was up 11% year-over-year. We again achieved strong results by product category, with notebooks up 16%, desktops up 10% and workstations up 8% year-over-year. This consistent performance is a result of our innovative product portfolio and effective execution. We delivered 3.8% operating margin in the quarter, which is up 10 basis points sequentially and down 50 basis points year-over-year. As we have highlighted throughout this fiscal year, margins have been pressured by industry-wide increases in component costs. We have increased prices globally, continued to leverage our supply chain scale and balance sheet, and have driven positive mix shifts in the business, enabling us to offset much of the commodity cost increases. Turning to Printing. Revenue was $4.9 billion in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year. Total hardware units were up 3% year-over-year, with consumer units up 3% and commercial units flat. In calendar Q3, overall print unit share was up about a point year-over-year with share gains in both our home and office businesses. Now moving to Q3 supplies performance. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 10% year-over-year or up 3% after adjusting for currency and last year’s negative impact resulting from the supplies sales model change. We continue to operate below our channel inventory ceilings. We are also making good progress with our growth initiatives. We are still in the early days of A3 and adding Samsung’s printing team and technology should be a further accelerator to the business over time. As Dion highlighted, the graphics business continued to grow and we look forward to entering into textiles [ph] later this year. It was also a very strong quarter for managed print services with high double digit new TCB growth. Managed print services results can be heavily impacted by large deals signed in a quarter. And this was the case for us in Q4 which was driven by key wins. Print operating profit was 16.6% in the quarter, up 2.6 points year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to the lower margins in Q4 2016 resulting from the supply sales model change. Excluding this onetime adjustment, we still saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year. Sequentially, print operating margins were down 70 basis points, driven by materially higher than normal unit shipments, especially in consumer. The overall supplies revenue mix for the quarter was 64% versus 66% in Q3. Now, turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $680 million in Q4 and approximately $3.7 billion for the full year. Free cash flow was $515 million in the quarter and approximately $3.3 billion fiscal 2017. Cash conversion cycle was minus 30 days, which weakened five days sequentially, driven by a three-day decrease in days payable outstanding, and a two -ay increase in days of inventory. Our cash conversion cycle and free cash flow results were better than expected for the quarter, driven by continued strength in Personal Systems revenue. During Q4, we had a total capital return of $722 million through share re-purchases and cash dividends. For the full year, we returned $2.3 billion or 59% of free cash flow, which is towards the higher end of our target range of 50% to 75%, even after overachieving our full year free cash flow guidance provided at our 2016 SAM. Looking forward, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. Starting with Samsung’s printing business, we are updating our full year FY 2018 outlook to include the operational impact of the acquisition. This includes approximately $1.4 billion incremental revenue, primarily A4, which has been in decline, particularly in the low-end; an additional penny of non-GAAP EPS for the full year. And as a reminder, we expect to be in investment mode in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, we expect to record various business combination accounting adjustments, which are not yet reflected in our outlook, since the acquisition just closed. These are noncash and GAAP-only costs and include adjustments to the fair value of certain acquired assets such as purchase intangibles and inventory. In addition, we will continue to look at opportunities to take costs out of the business, now that the deal has closed. For the rest of Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up for the full year. This is organic growth and excludes any impact from the acquisition of Samsung’s printing business. In addition, we expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV. In Personal Systems, we now expect the cost of components will continue to increase from Q4 into Q1 and will remain elevated throughout FY18. We anticipate that ASPs may be pressured due to competitive repricing effectively offsetting a sizeable portion of any gross currency tailwind, but this will depend on the actual market dynamics including component costs, competition and currency rates. Overall, we would expect more of the FX favorability to show up during the second half of the year as prior hedges roll off. For the full year, we expect to deliver our productivity initiatives as guided at SAM. We’ll also continue to leverage our balance sheet, if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. With all that in mind, we expect free cash flow to be at least $3 billion for the full year and our cash conversion cycle to be approximately minus 29 days as we exit FY18. Q1 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.40 to $0.43. Q1 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.38 to $0.42. With the $0.01 increase in EPS from our acquisition of Samsung’s printing business, we’re raising our full year fiscal 2018 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share by a $0.01 to be in a range of a $1.75 to $1.85, and our full year fiscal 2018 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of a $1.70 to a $1.80. With that, let’s go eat some turkey, or we can open up the call for questions.
Operator: We’ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team, as well as a happy early Thanksgiving. I have two questions, I’ll ask them at the same time. Perhaps the first one is to Dion or Cathie, and the second one more towards Cathie. Regarding the -- Dion, the sales upside was -- looks like across basically almost every line and every end-market, which is great but the drop here to EPS at the bottom, I guess some investors could have wanted or hoped for more. Are you spending a little more for like investing in the business, in the channel and products and R&D? And if so, what are the specific areas as to where you’re investing or not seeing the drop through? And then, the follow-up is on the Samsung acquisition, a $0.01 of earnings. I assume that it’s first half of the year more of a headwind as you integrate and the accretion comes in at the tail end and then longer term, it should be much more than a $0.01 of annual EPS?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Jim, let me start with the first one in terms of your comment around the drop. I think, the way we think about this is if you go back to kind of the Q3 earnings call, we provided an EPS range, and we ended up at the higher end of that range. So, we anticipated kind of where we thought we would end up. Now, we did see a little bit of upside from a Personal Systems perspective, and that drove a lot of the top line, and there just isn’t as much drop in Personal Systems, especially when you combine that with commodity cost headwinds that we’ve seen in that business. And then, on top of that in print, what we were really focused on this quarter was not only keeping supplies stabilized, which we did, very pleased with the results there, but we also took advantage of a little bit bigger market and also the opportunity to place materially more printer units than what we would normally see on a sequential basis. And so that obviously put some downward pressure on operating profit and EPS as well.
Operator: The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Cathie Lesjak: Operator, can you hold on just one sec? I think there was another question specifically related to Samsung, Jim, if I remember correctly. And basically we’ve obviously just closed the acquisition at the beginning of November. And for FY18, we do expect to see about a $0.01 of accretion but it is more backend loaded. So, for the whole year, it would be about a $0.01, but we do expect to be in investment mode in the first half of 2018. And then, over time, the pressure that we see on the math around the OP rate as a result of the acquisition of the Samsung printing business, we do expect that as we integrate that business and take advantage of the disruption, the disruptive technology they have in the A3 copier space that in fact the margins will recover. Okay. Operator, next question? 
Operator: The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Katy Huberty: Thank you. Couple of follow-ups on the printer business. If I heard you right, organically printer supplies grew 3% in the quarter, you’re guiding for flat to slightly up next year. So, can you talk about the elements in the four-box model that suggests a little bit of a deceleration as you got into next year? And then, just a follow-up on printer margins, they came in below the 17%ish that you were at the last few quarters. Can you just walk through some of those factors? And as you bake in some of the new categories you’re entering as well as Samsung, where do you think the near to medium-term range for printer margins will be? Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: So, let me start with the supplies question. Katy, thanks for that question. We have really proven to ourselves and hopefully to you that you should have confidence in our four-box model. We saw that we performed at least as well as we had expected and in some cases a bit better than what we had expected, both for the full year 2017 quarter by quarter as well as in Q4. And based on that, we grew supplies, obviously in Q3 and Q4 operationally, and we’ve plugged that into the model. And what we see coming out of the model is that supplies for FY18 would be flat to slightly up. But keep in mind, we are always working on ways to optimize kind of each of the boxes with a variety of strategies and tactics, and we will continue to do that and try to drive even better supplies performance.
Dion Weisler: Second question was around margins over time. 
Cathie Lesjak: And in terms of print margins over time, what we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, and this is without Samsung, was that over the long term, we would expect that the print margins would be in the 16% to 18% range. In the shorter term with Samsung, there will be pressure on the rate. I mean, think about that we brought Samsung in at about a $1.4 billion in revenue for FY18 and about a $0.01 of net profit to the Company. And in near to short-term, the next half, we expect it to be in investment mode. So, there will be incremental pressure. But, we do think over time that those margins get back to the 16% to 18% range.
Dion Weisler: And Katy just to reiterate the point that Cathie made to Jim’s question, the rate was slightly down this quarter but we did place sequentially many more units than we ordinarily would. And of course that bring the razorblade business model, generates returns over time, positive NPV units and a good deal for our investors.
Operator: The next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Please go ahead. 
Steve Milunovich: Following up on that, you did put more units out there, but the growth at least was higher on consumer than in commercial. And generally, the commercial units, I would think would have a greater attach rate. So, I guess what’s your confidence that those are in fact going to be NPV positive if it’s skewed a bit more toward consumer?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Steve, we have a lot of confidence. Our consumer portfolio, particularly in the inkjet space, those printers phone [ph] home regularly and they let us know where and what types of printers are getting really strong attach rate. You’re absolutely right, most of the incremental units were in the consumer space because that’s where we saw both a little bit better market sizing and then also on an opportunity to place positive NPV units.
Steve Milunovich: Okay. And then, should we look for a little bit of growth for the printer business next year? It sounds like graphics probably grows, supplies flat to up; I don’t know what hardware does, but you put all together. I assume, it’s a little bit of growth. And if we’re sitting here a year from now, what are your priorities, what are you hoping to achieve and how do we -- this last year was all about stabilizing supplies, what are we looking for to accomplish in the next 12 months?
Cathie Lesjak: I think Enrique said it best at the Security Analyst Meeting. We’re really focused on accelerating growth. We don’t guide revenue. But if you do the math, if you’ve done the math, you can imagine. I mean, if supplies is, 60 plus, 65% plus of the revenue and it’s flat to slightly up, and we’ve got growth initiatives across the A3 copier space, where we think there is real opportunities, we’ve got the 3D printing opportunity to grow, we think that we’re actually as Dion say, just getting started in that space.
Dion Weisler: I think it’s always important to remember, Steve, we’re executing across our entire strategy, which is to cross three pillars of our core business. It generates the vast majority of our revenue and operating profit today. The growth initiatives around A3, our graphics business, everything is a service which will obviously provide growth opportunities for us over the next two to three years and then further out into the future over the next five to ten years, the work we’re doing around the most of computing and 3D printing, really crates an opportunity for long-term growth for our shareholders.
Operator: The next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sherri Scribner: I want to ask a question on the PC business as we move forward into fiscal 2018. I think Cathie, you mentioned the compare is much more difficult in fiscal 2018. I think the bearish view is that the PC business will have a hard time growing next year. Are you guys anticipating being able to grow the PC business and what will help drive that growth?
Dion Weisler: Well, let me start sort of long-term, and Cathie might want to weigh in a little more than that. I’d still remind everybody this is still a $333 billion market that one in five machines got an HP logo on it, means four out of five don’t; that represents opportunity for us. I’ve said consistently that the market is consolidating; the top four grew 3.5%. We grew at 2.5-point premium to that. So, certainly, the big is getting bigger and we are growing much faster than the big four. And that’s really off the back of strong innovation to this lineup, I think we have ever had, we are getting incredibly positive reviews consistently. It’s a continuous transformation of the business to more profitable subcategories, finding where the heat is into the market and where we can get value for the innovation that we are creating. And in quarter four, that paid off yet again. We saw topline -- strong topline growth, sequential growth in operating profit. We saw year-over-year share gains. But those share gains, I’ll remind everyone and not an objective but rather an outcome of all of this work. There is no single magic pill that was all categories, all regions. The channel inventory was well under control. We aged inventory was well-managed. I think really kudos to the team both regionally within the business units, the supply chains and the functions. I think we are in a very good position to compete as we go forward in this market.
Cathie Lesjak: And I think, Ron laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting the fact that core traditional PC market from a unit and revenue perspective would be down in 2018 over 2017. But, as you’ve seen and as Dion talked about, we are playing our game and we know how to compete and win. We’ve got to make sure that we’ve got a great cost structure that we do hyper-segmentation and that we reinvest back into innovation, so that we can grow the market. The compares are tougher, no question about that. I mean, last year, we grew 10% in Q1 year-over-year, 10% in Q2, 12% in Q3 and now 13% in Q4. So, there are tough compares. But we know how to operate in this environment, and to outgrow our competition.
Sherri Scribner: And then, just a question on Samsung. I think you mentioned 1.9 billion in revenue to add. Can you give us some sense of how that breaks out between supplies and hardware units? And then, also on the margins, just to clarify, would you expect to be below the 16% to 18% operating margin in the first half of the year because of the dilution from acquisition or do you think you can still be in that 16% to 18% range?
Dion Weisler: Why don’t I sort of stop, because I know, we’ve got some new investors that have come into the stock and I think it’s important to reiterate and recall why this transaction was important to us, given that we’ve just closed the transaction, and then Cathie can talk specifically to those numbers. First of all, we welcome the Samsung print team to our family. And for our new investors, we bought this business for three primary reasons. Firstly, the A3 market is a $55 billion market and we are underpenetrated in that market relative to the A4 market where we have very strong market leadership. The traditional A3 players operate very complex machines, if you were to break those machines down, they would -- you would see thousands of parts on the ground. The Samsung technology really disrupts those traditional copiers with copier level performance but significantly less complex machine, the thousands of parts, when you were to break a Samsung down would be hundreds of parts. And this lowers the cost to operate and that translates to increased margins for our partners and/or lower cost per page for our customers. So, we have an extremely strong portfolio when you put our technology together with the Samsung technology now, HP technology in both the A4 and A3 spaces in Ink, in PageWide, and in Laser, the second reason is that we integrated it, the A3 and the A4 portfolio which really increases our managed print services capability, there’re certain customers and tenders that would come out, that had a requirement for a mixed deployment of both A3 and A4 and were often excluded from those A4 deals. Now having a very full portfolio, actually opens up A4, new A4 opportunities for us. And the third is, we now have incredible thing, we inherited more than a 1,000 top class engineers, industry-leading R&D team in laser space, includes go-to-market capability more than 6,500 patents being added to our core. And I think this newly combined team is increasingly diverse and industry-leading. And so with that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to attract at least 12 points -- or 12% of A3 market share in the next three years.
Cathie Lesjak: And then with respect to Samsung’s business, some of the things to keep in mind is that the revenue that I talked about for FY18 is $1.4 billion and the business that Samsung has is mostly A4 laser. And within that historically has been largely low-end laser, which means their supplies mix, as a percentage of the total print business is materially lower than our current business. And our job is to obviously improve that but they are -- they do run quite a bit lower in terms of percentage of revenue. In terms of the margins, I’ll leave it up to you to actually do the math on whether or not you think they drop below 16%. We know that in the very short term, there’s pressure from the Samsung business but over the long term, we’ll get back to good strong margins.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: I just wanted to follow up on Samsung. So, I think when you bought the business, you said it was a $1.8 billion business and supplies were about $1 billion, you’re guiding for a $1.4 billion for next year. Maybe you can tell us what the trailing 12 months was. And given that supplies shouldn’t roll off all that quickly that feels like a really dramatic decline in hardware, and maybe you can speak to that? And I’ve a follow-up, please.
Cathie Lesjak: So, Toni, in terms of $1.8 billion, that was the 2015 revenue for the Samsung printing business. But, we’ve never talked about what the percentage was of that that was supplies, and they run materially lower on supplies as a percentage of the revenue mix than HP does. So, I can’t really talk to that. But what is pretty typical is that when you have a long period between announce and close, there’s a lot of uncertainty and customers make choices. Right? And so, we’re not surprised by the fact that Samsung printing has lost market share and declined their revenues. And keep in mind again, this is mostly in the A4 -- low-end A4 Laser space, and that’s really not the reason why we bought the Samsung printing business, we really bought it to disrupt the A3 copier space.
Toni Sacconaghi: Just, if we’re ever going to really know what your organic supplies growth rate is next year, we really need to know how much is coming from Samsung. So, if you are not going to give it out now, are you going to be giving it out in the future? And then, my follow-up or separate question is just on PC ASPs; they were up about 8% year-over-year, which I think is a reflection of DRAM and some of the high-end targeting that you guys have done. I guess, the question would be, why wouldn’t we expect pretty rich ASP declines again in fiscal 2018, particularly in the first half?
Cathie Lesjak: Okay. In terms of Samsung, one of the challenges we are absolutely going to have on a go forward basis is with Samsung is that if we do our job right and we fully merge and integrate the HP print business with the Samsung printing business, we are going to be doing things like optimizing the portfolio and completely integrating go-to-market and R&D. So, it will become increasingly difficult for us to break out what was -- what is the Samsung’s printing business versus the HP Printing business. So that will be a challenge on a go forward basis. We can discuss and decide whether or not we are going to talk about supplies, tell you what the supplies percentage is of the $1.4 billion. But, on a go forward basis, it’s going to be very difficult. We will do the best we can, so that we can give you a good view of whether or not we are flat to slightly up on supplies, and we expect that we will be without Samsung.
Dion Weisler: The other thing to remember Toni on Samsung is that still the largest portion of the composition of the revenue today is A4. You’ll recall that we acquired these assets, so the A3 capability which was still largely in an investment mode. And so, as we move more and more into the A3 market and we shift the business from transactional to contractual, that generally comes with the higher supplies attraction. And so the composition of supplies over time is indeed going to change.
Cathie Lesjak: And then, in terms of your question on ASPs, Toni, can I just ask a clarifying question? You talked about the ASPs being up year-over-year as a result of the kind of the pressures from commodity costs and the repricing actions that we took. And I agree that is -- big piece of it as is the mix shift to higher end products, things like premium, gaming and work stations. But, then, you said why wouldn’t we expect a decrease, did you say in -- a material decrease in ASPs in 2018, is that what you asked?
Toni Sacconaghi: No, I’m sorry. I wasn’t clear. I was saying why would you not expect a similar level of ASP increases, particularly in the first half of the year and a substantial increase still year-over-year?
Cathie Lesjak: So, on a year-over-year basis, we do expect that there will be an increase in ASPs related to commodity costs but what we’ve been talking about in terms of the counter pressure is that the currency environment has gotten -- the currencies have gotten much stronger. And therefore there is kind of the counterbalance to that is what are the pressures going to be, the competitive pressures to actually decrease local currency prices in the foreign markets? And that’s where we think there could be some significant downward pressure in ASPs for Personal Systems.
Operator: The next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross: I have one follow-up on Samsung, then another. So, with regard to Samsung, sort of operationally, how are you thinking about the integration? And I’m trying to figure out within the one penny of accretion, how much synergy is in there or how much visibility you had prior to the closing the deal three weeks ago? And then, I have a follow-up. 
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Shannon. Of course, we were competitors up until that sort of 20 days ago. And so, you can imagine, this is somewhat of a tricky acquisition in terms of exactly how much information that we had leading into the closure. I would say, still very early days. The integration is going incredibly well; the team is incredibly focused on our customers, doing all the right things. But, we’re learning every day as we get under the covers of this business. We would expect that as our team looks at best industry practice that’s got us to the position where we are today that there will indeed be opportunities to capture those synergies. But, I would just say, it’s a little too early, not more than 20 days into the acquisition, to give you a lot of specifics around that.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then, sort of utilizing those synergies or maybe incremental synergies, you have 3D printing, you A3, I guess, gaming on the on the PC side and some other investments that your making. How are you engaging the level of investment per initiative or how are you thinking about the return on what you’re doing? And then, on the other side, I would assume continuing to reduce costs and simplify the business within sort of the core that may be isn’t growing as much as some of your growth opportunities.
Dion Weisler: Well, I think you’ve actually summarized it really well. We focus incredibly on cost, it’s table stakes. You have to be in the right cost position. If you’re not on the right cost position, you don’t have the opportunity to make investments. As it relates to investments, we feel good about the investment choices ahead of us. We believe we can create significant shareholder value. As we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting, we have confidence in our ability to execute and hope that we’ve dropped $1 or $2 in the trust bank over the course of the last couple of years to demonstrate that we can execute. I would say that our investment thesis and process that we follow is that we identify investment opportunities across the business, we weigh them all against one another. We’re very targeted to ensure that the investments that we do make advance our strategy, so that we don’t surprise anyone with the investments that we’re making. We’re very disciplined about establishing and hitting the milestones that we lay out. And ultimately, generating profitable growth is what it’s all about. Growth for just growth sake is not particularly fascinating. I think segment by segment, we’re demonstrating that those investments are good choices, investment systems, broadly in premium and specifically in gaming are great examples of investments that we made that are paying dividends right now. Same is true for graphics and the very targeted unit placements that Cathie talked about, NPV positive units and print. 3D printing has gone from a business that was nonexistent a year ago to a real business today, 65 channel partners around the globe in every single region and ecosystem that we’ve developed, partners in Deloitte and Siemens, more than 50 materials partners that are starting to look at making materials for the platform, plus the technology announcements that we made at the Security and Analyst Meeting around a lower cost color platform and the technology announcements we’ll make around metals in 2018. So, we’re feeling good about our ability to execute in the core, in the growth areas that we outlined, as well as the future.
Cathie Lesjak: And Shannon, just to remind you, this is all very returns based analysis. We step back and we look at what the investment is that’s necessary and then what the opportunity is in terms of cash flows on a go-forward basis to determine whether or not, it will add value to the firm. And then, also to stack rank and determine which ones we are actually going to invest in.
Operator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan: I have a Samsung question, then a follow-up. So, Cathie, I think you said that the mix of hardware relative to supplies is intrinsically quite different in the Samsung business relative to the core HP business. Now, the shrinkage in revenue from the time you announced the $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion, I would think that’s more or less hardware related. Is that a right assumption to make. And so, as the percentage mix that you are alluding to, is that something that holds true, both at the 1.8 billion and 1.4 billion level? And I have a follow-up.
Cathie Lesjak: So, Wamsi, yes, the mix of the $1.4 billion in revenue for supplies is materially lower than the current HP business.
Wamsi Mohan: But, would you say Cathie that the decline from 1.8 to 1.4 was largely hardware related?
Cathie Lesjak: I think it was led by hardware but it had obviously ramifications for supplies as well.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. And if I could follow up. On the PC gaming market, maybe Dion, you could share some sense of how much share you are you gaining in this market? How big of a growth driver it was in fiscal 2017 out of your total growth? Maybe if you could give us how many points of growth was driven PC gaming, that’d be great?
Dion Weisler: We don’t break it down at a segment level. And I think there are better sources of data to look at how much share we’ve taken in that particular space. And I wouldn’t want to make our analysts redundant. I would just say that this has been a material business for us that’s grown up over the last 18 months from nothing to a sizable portion, not only in terms of revenue but the gross margin that it drives, as well as the halo effect that it has on the overall brand, which I think is lifting our premium segment as well as every other segment that we had within the PC business. This is an incredible franchise; it’s a growing franchise; the airier is growing. And there is more people that are tuning in to these battlegrounds than game 7 of the NBA. So, we like being in this business and we see the growth continuing.
Operator: The last question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Amit Daryanani: Perfect. I guess, I need to start with the Samsung question as well. I guess, Cathie, it sounds like the deal is dilutive near-term. Your Jan quarter EPS guide that you guys gave us essentially bracking The Street numbers. Could you quantify what the EPS dilution is in the Jan quarter from Samsung and what’s the timeline to get this asset back to the 16%, 18% margin range that you guys have talked about core IPG historically?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Amit, we are not going to break down Samsung in that level of detail quarter-by-quarter. I think it’s suffice it to say that with our guide for Q1 2018 of $0.40 to $0.43 for non-GAAP EPS, we are covering and absorbing the little bit of headwind that we get from Samsung. And I’m sorry, what was the second part of your question?
Amit Daryanani: The second part was really -- you’ve talked about the Samsung asset longer term being in line to core IPG margins, 16% to 18%, what sort of timeline is that, is that a fiscal 2020 target or is that much more longer term than that?
Cathie Lesjak: It will take us some time, but we’ll see pretty consistent progress over the next few years to get it back to those levels.
Dion Weisler: I think it’s really worth reiterating why we acquired this asset. It was not to buy revenue. And I’m being pretty clear about that as is Cathie. We don’t chase share for share’s sake. And whilst the revenue is interesting, it’s not fascinating. What’s fascinating for us is the incredible disruptive technology that this team invented to take on a pretty unconsolidated A3 $55 billion copier market with a better mousetrap that enables our partners to earn more money and enables a lower cost per page for our customers with a very different value proposition from a servicing perspective. More than a 1,000 engineers of very rich portfolio of patents. It’s all of those reasons that we’ll pay dividends over time that we’re incredibly interested in and why we acquired this asset and we’re just kind of getting started in this space.
Amit Daryanani: And if I could just follow up on the core PC business, could you tell us how much of a headwind did you guys have on operating margins from memory right now? I mean, year-over-year, it is down about 50 basis points; revenue is up double-digits. So, just trying to get sense, how much memory had been you dealing with on op margin basis?
Cathie Lesjak: So, Amit, if you look at the total year, our commodity costs headwind was about a $1 billion. And so, we’ve actually done -- I think Dion talked about, we’ve done a really good job of managing in what has been a very tough industry-wide commodity cost environment. And we’ve done that by leveraging our balance sheet, looking at basically buying strategic -- doing some incremental strategic purchases to assure ourselves of supply, entering into longer term agreements, so that we not only assure ourselves of supply but also that we are able to negotiate better prices. We also have mitigated it by using our balance sheet by putting more product on the sea and then, when all of that -- we figure all that out and then we look at what kind of repricing that we’re able to do and still be able to be very competitive in the market. And in fact, as you see, significantly outgrow the market with kind of all of those tactics coming together.
Dion Weisler: So, with that, I want to take the opportunity to thank you all. I have been Americanized and I understand, it is a season of Thanksgiving, and we’re between you and a turkey. So, I want to thank you for following us through the course of our reinvention journey. Our results give us real confidence in the trajectory of our business going forward. We’re leading in our core markets, we’re entering new growth markets and natural adjacencies and at the same time investing in the future. We’ve never been more competitive. We remain humble and focused. We’re proud of the results that we’re delivering and proud that we’ve been very open and transparent and dependable. We think it’s been a great year of reinvention and we’re just getting started. Thanks all. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Cathie Lesjak: Happy Thanksgiving.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q3  (2017-08-23 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2017 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Steve Fieler, Head of Treasury. Please proceed.
Steve Fieler: Good afternoon. I'm Steve Fieler, Head of Treasury for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2017 third quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2017, and HP's other SEC filings. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I'll hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It was another outstanding quarter showcasing strong execution of our strategy. I'm very pleased with our sustained performance and continued momentum. We are striking the right balance in how we plan, innovate and consistently deliver. We are competing and winning in our core print and PC markets. We're entering new growth markets and natural adjacencies with the right products, supply chain and go-to-market with world-class sustainability. We're investing in future categories where we can disrupt with innovation, and we are relentlessly focused on increasing productivity and taking cost out of the business. With that context, let me highlight a few outstanding results for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.43, at the high-end of our outlook range. We grew net revenue 10% year-over-year to $13.1 billion, and for the second consecutive quarter, achieved growth in both Personal Systems and Print segments. And we continue to see broad-based growth across all regions with double-digit year-over-year increases in both EMEA and APJ. We surpassed our expectations entering the year delivering free cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion for the quarter and $2.8 billion year-to-date. And through quarter 3, we returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the past 7 quarters since HP became a standalone company, you've heard us talk about reinvention. We reinvented ourselves, our company and our solutions to amaze our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Reinvention is a long journey, but we're driving consistent results and seeing our hard work and dedication bear fruit. Make no mistake, there is much more work to do based on the volatility of our markets, but the past several quarters reflect our ability to consistently execute with a healthy balance across our portfolio and across all of our regions. We continue to leverage our innovation, differentiation and scale to create unique advantage and drive further growth. Now let me turn to business segment performance. Personal Systems had another stellar quarter. We achieved double-digit revenue growth for the third quarter in a row despite a tougher year-over-year compare. The results were balanced across the business with double-digit revenue growth across all 3 geographic regions in Consumer and Commercial and across Notebook and Workstations. I'm also encouraged that desktops returned to growth in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing reinvention of products. In calendar quarter 2, we outgrew the PC market unit growth by 9.5 points year-over-year, remaining the #1 global PC market share leader with 22.8% share. We saw year-over-year share gains in each region with Americas increasing share by nearly 3 points in both Consumer and Commercial. While we are proud of these results and the team's efforts, share gain continues to be an outcome, not the objective. Profitable growth will continue to be our priority. To this end, Personal Systems operating profit dollars, margins and revenue each grew sequentially despite the remaining industry-wide component cost headwinds. We are being proactive with our ongoing productivity efforts, repricing actions and focus on product mix. During the quarter, we continue to reinvent our Personal Systems business and ship the most secure and manageable PCs to our customers. We have raised the bar in the premium segment with the new Spectre X2, and we expanded our OMEN gaming portfolio with a new virtual reality backpack. And we offered even greater value to our customers buying Pavilion devices with extended battery life and new features such as biometric log-on and inking support. As a category, PC market revenue grew year-over-year in calendar quarter 2. Although units were down, the market remains highly competitive. But with that said, we have a strategy that is delivering. We're planning our own game, pursuing the heat in the market and it's paying off. We are now consistently achieving industry-leading results and setting the standard for the type of balanced performance the category has not seen in quite some time. The team's execution is truly superb. Shifting to Printing, the business delivered across multiple dimensions, reflecting operational progress and sustained momentum as we continue to ignite a Renaissance in Printing. Total revenue was up 6% year-over-year and once again included growth in both hardware and supplies. Units also grew year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter, and we remain well positioned to place positive NPV units. Total print unit market share was 38.5% in calendar quarter 2. We saw a slight unit share increase year-over-year in our office business and a slight decline in our home business. Turning to supplies. We are pleased to report that supply stabilization occurred in quarter 3, one quarter earlier than originally expected. Supplies revenue grew 10% year-over-year on a reported basis or up 2% after adjusting for constant currency and last year's supplies sales model changes. As you know, this is an important milestone and has taken a concerted effort across the Print team to achieve. Going forward, we expect the same execution in the 4-box model in order to consistently win in the market. Additionally, we are making progress in our strategic growth areas and have the opportunity to do more. Our Graphics business grew revenue year-over-year and constant currency for the 16th consecutive quarter. While I like this trend with our leading portfolio, this is an area where we can be growing even faster. Quarter 3 was the first full quarter of shipping our portfolio of disruptive A3 multifunction printers, and we are encouraged by the early progress. These are the most secure printers in the world. The customer reception has been positive, and we are adding new channel partners ahead of plan. Further supporting our A3 momentum, we expect the acquisition of Samsung's printing business to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Managed print services continue to grow revenue year-over-year. We have the opportunity to further accelerate this business, especially with our growing A3 portfolio. In summary, for Printing, I'm very encouraged by the strong and balanced performance across hardware, supplies and our key growth initiatives. Turning to 3D Printing. This quarter, we launched our business in Asia Pacific, the world's largest manufacturing market, expanding into Greater China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Australia. We now have more than 45 resellers globally and more than 20 reference and experienced centers. We're also expanding our open materials ecosystem, adding Sinopec, one of the largest integrated energy and chemical companies in China to our growing list of material partners. Shipments are accelerating, and we continue to have new and repeat customer wins with some of the largest companies in their industries such as Jaguar Land Rover, Flex, and others in automotive, pharmaceutical, government and education. We are also driving continued growth with manufacturing service bureaus, a key part of our market expansion strategy. This includes leaders such as FORECAST 3D in the United States, which has deployed a dozen systems to anchor a full-scale 3D production facility; Materialise in Europe; and Shining 3D ePrint in China, among others. We are pleased with the progress of this strategically important part of our future and continue to execute on our long-term plan for disrupting the $12 trillion manufacturing market. Overall, I'm proud of our Q3 performance and confident in our future. We're executing across multiple strategic dimensions and positioning HP to capture the big opportunities today and well into the future. We're delivering short term while investing for the long term, gaining share with a focus on profitability and driving both operational efficiencies and innovation across our business. In closing, I said a couple of things last quarter that are worth repeating. First, every day, we must amaze our customers and partners. This focus underpins our results and guides our future performance. And second, change is a constant in this business. And to us, change equals opportunity. We must continue to embrace and drive change with an eye on delivering long-term growth and returns. I'll now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details and our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. We've continued the momentum from our strong first half, and I'm very pleased with our third quarter results. We delivered net revenue of $13.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We continue to see broad-based and consistent performance across businesses and geographies. Regionally, year-over-year, Americas grew 8%; EMEA was up 14%; and APJ grew 15%, all in constant currency. Gross margin at 18.6% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. The increase was driven primarily by Print margins resulting from productivity improvements and higher supplies mix, partially offset by higher commodity cost in Personal Systems. Sequentially, gross margin was down 60 basis points, driven by an unfavorable print mix and a higher sequential growth in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were up 35% as reported, but this year-over-year variance is largely driven by gains recorded last year resulting from the divestiture of certain marketing optimization software assets. Sequentially, operating expenses were down 1%. Net OI&E expense was $66 million for the quarter with a non-GAAP tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.43. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring other charges of $46 million and acquisition-related charges of $40 million, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $34 million, tax indemnification credits of $10 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q3, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.41. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was an impressive $8.4 billion, up 12% year-over-year as reported or 13% in constant currency. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit constant currency growth. We continue to segment the market and offer some of our most innovative products ever. These efforts have helped us sustain revenue momentum, deliver consistently across each region and drive strong market share as an end result. By customer segment, Consumer revenue was up 14% year-over-year, and we gained unit share across each of the 3 regions in calendar Q2. Commercial revenue was up 11% year-over-year. And similarly, we gained unit share across each region. We also achieved strong results by product category with Notebooks up 16%, Desktops up 5% and Workstations up 11% year-over-year. We delivered 3.7% operating margin in the quarter, which is up 0.5 points quarter-to-quarter, above historical seasonality and down 0.7 points year-over-year. Consistent with what we said last quarter, margins have been pressured by industry-wide increases in component costs and currency headwinds. We have increased pricing globally and have continued to see positive mix shifts in the business, both of which have helped improve operating margins sequentially. However, we remain cautious about the potential negative impact on demand, which could result from higher prices. Turning to Printing. The momentum gained in Q2 carried into Q3. Revenue was $4.7 billion in the quarter, up 6% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. Hardware units were up 1% year-over-year with Consumer units up 1% and Commercial units flat. As noted previously, our total unit growth includes HP Sprocket, our handheld photo printer. In calendar Q2, overall print unit share was roughly flat sequentially and year-over-year. We remain optimistic about our print growth businesses. Our A3 business is off to a strong start since launching its new product lineup in Q2, and we're excited about the opportunity to be a disruptive new entrant in this $55 billion market. As Dion highlighted, both Graphics and Managed Print Services continue to grow revenue year-over-year, and we have the opportunity to increase our growth rates. Now moving to Q3 supplies performance. Revenue of $3.1 billion was up 10% year-over-year and represented 66% of Print revenue. The supplies growth was better than anticipated, driven by improving 4-box model drivers. As we described in the past, the way we look at supplies revenue growth operationally is to take our as-reported number and adjust for 2 things. First, we look at constant currency growth. In Q3, currency represented less than a point of delta, so supplies grew 10% year-over-year in constant currency. Second, we adjust for changes made in the second half of last year to our supplies sales model. In Q3 '16, reported supplies revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $225 million or 8 points of growth. Therefore, when you deduct the 8 points against the 10% constant currency growth, net adjusted supplies growth for Q3 '17 was 2% year-over-year. We are very pleased to have achieved supply stabilization a quarter earlier than expected. We also expect to consistently operate with supplies channel inventory levels remaining at or below our ceiling. And in Q3, channel inventory levels were below the ceiling. As a reminder, as part of making the supplies sales model changes last year, we lowered our channel inventory ceiling to better reflect the more demand-driven sales model. Looking forward to Q4 '17, we expect that our year-over-year supplies revenue growth will remain flat to slightly up when making similar operational adjustments for currency and then backing out approximately $225 million for the supplies sales model channel inventory adjustment taken in Q4 of '16. Print operating profit was 17.3% in the quarter, down 3.1 points year-over-year and down 10 basis points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to the onetime adjustments I mentioned earlier. The positive margin impact of divesting certain marketing optimization software assets offset by the negative impact of changing the supplies sales model plus productivity improvements year-over-year. Excluding the onetime adjustments, we saw good operating profit dollar expansion year-over-year. Sequentially, the 10 basis point decline is consistent with normal seasonality. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in Q3 and approximately $3 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the quarter and approximately $2.8 billion year-to-date. Cash conversion cycle was minus 35 days, a 5-day sequential improvement driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding offset by a 1-day increase in days of inventory and a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding. The strong Q3 results were driven by Personal Systems revenue performance, which grew sequentially by over $700 million or 10%, well above historical norms. This incremental volume materially helped near-term working capital, including days payable. As you know, since Personal Systems has a negative cash conversion cycle, the timing of cash flow was impacted either positively or negatively depending on its sequential revenue performance. Also, we saw a positive business linearity in purchasing and other receivables, which supported improved timing of cash flows by a couple hundred million dollars. Year-to-date cash flow is now ahead of our full year range provided during last year's Security Analyst Meeting. We are now targeting a higher revised full year free cash flow outlook of at least $3 billion. This assumes a cash conversion cycle down sequentially, more than normal seasonality and more in line with the first half performance. Finally, we expect higher fourth quarter capital expenditures but will not exceed our full year CapEx guidance of $500 million. During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $524 million through share repurchases and cash dividends. Year-to-date, we have returned 56% of free cash flow as compared to our full year target of 50% to 75%. For the full year, we still expect to deliver returns towards the higher end of the range. Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. For the full year, we are on track to deliver our productivity initiatives as announced at SAM. In Personal Systems, we expect to see continued increases in cost of components in Q4. We expect to offset these headwinds with increased pricing, which could have a more significant impact on demand and operating margins than we've assumed. With this demand uncertainty, combined with our very strong Q3 revenue performance, we expect Personal Systems Q4 revenue to grow less than normal sequential seasonality. For Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in Q4 in constant currency and adjusted for last year's supplies sales model change. We also expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV. Given our hedging strategy, we have rolling currency hedges, which extend into future quarters. And therefore, we do not expect a material tailwind from currency in Q4 '17. We will also continue to leverage our balance sheet if we see attractive economic opportunities to do so. With all that in mind, Q4 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.42 to $0.45. Q4 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.37 to $0.41. We are raising the midpoint of our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP and GAAP EPS, full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.66, and full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $1.46 to $1.50. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: You guys have done a good job of returning supplies to some modest growth when you make the adjustments from last year. We saw 2% growth this quarter, which was the same growth we saw last year. What type of long-term growth would you expect based on the 4-box model? Should we assume that supply is generally flat long term or do you think that growth is modestly single digits? At some way, it would be helpful to learn your long-term perspective.
Dion Weisler: I think it's important to remind everybody how we define stabilization. We've done that on previous calls, and we've said that supplies revenue and  constant currency not declining further is our definition. We also walked you over the last couple of years through the 4-box model drivers and our consistent focus on driving improvement across each of those 4 boxes. Now in quarter 3, our focus and execution over the last 2 years on all 4 of those drivers saw the supplies revenue mature and stabilize 1 quarter ahead of plan, and we're very, very encouraged by that. As it relates to quarter 4, we're on track for supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in constant currency as well as being adjusted for last year's supplies sales model change. Beyond quarter 4, we believe we can drive further improvements across all the 4-box model drivers to impact supplies revenue as we go forward.
Catherine Lesjak: And Sherri, we'll talk more about FY '18 specifically at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. So everyone should join us then.
Operator: The next question will be from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: As part of shipping this installed base that you talked about sort of placing high-value printers, you've seen some deceleration in the growth rates on printer placements. How much of that is an opt-out of lower NPV printers versus competitive dynamics or versus the market slowdown? And do you feel that the installed base is shaping up to a profile that can keep this positive supplies growth over the next year or so on an organic basis as you're defining on this adjusted basis? And I have a follow-up for Cathie.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So from a growth perspective -- first off, it's a little bit tougher compare, right? So if you actually look at what's happened to unit growth, kind of each of the quarters this year, each quarter the previous year is a bit tougher. So I think that's part of what's going on. And then the other part is that we are very much focused on high-value units. As we've talked about before, all units are not created equal in the market, and where we want to focus all of our energy is really on positive NPV. And those typically are really the high usage categories. That's where we want to grow and where we want to gain share.
Dion Weisler: And so double-clicking a little bit on that, Wamsi, I would say that the team continues to execute on both the core and the growth initiatives and they're maintaining sort of steady momentum in print hardware as we have over the last several quarters. In quarter 3, print hardware units grew 1% year-over-year. But notably, this was driven by better-than-normal sequential growth of 4%. And we achieved slight increases year-over-year in both Commercial and Consumer hardware, which was driven by a very disciplined focus on the 4-box model drivers, particularly high-quality units that you're referring to there in your questions such as growth in the office A4 laser market. Of course, this comes with high usage. Double-digit growth in multifunction value, that's the 21st consecutive quarter in a row of growth in that segment. We are ramping our A3 business for the first full quarter. We only have 6% market share, as you'll recall, of this $55 billion market. Encouraging thing is that is up 1%. We were 5% last quarter and homing also, which is a more profitable part of the market for us due to the full verticalization of our technology. We're pleased with the results but obviously, always more work that we can do.
Wamsi Mohan: If I could follow up on your free cash flow, you're now achieving $3 billion here, and that's including some restructuring payments as well. How close is this to what you would call normalized free cash flow for the company?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think -- I don't think there is necessarily a normalized free cash flow. One of the things that you saw in the strength of our free cash flow this quarter was the business mix impact.  So when Personal Systems grows $700 million revenue sequentially, or 10% well above normal sequential, you're going to see a big increase in accounts payable as you saw and a lot of free cash flow. So the concept of normalized free cash flow is really not one that I can really comment on directly.
Operator: The next question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: I'm trying to decipher your comments on PC revenue for the fourth quarter. Do you see a scenario where PC revenue actually declines sequentially? Or your commentary is just that it grows slower than normal seasonality and then maybe in that answered comment on which market, Consumer or Commercial, you see more price sensitivity? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Katy. So instead it will grow less quickly than what is typical seasonality, not that it'll decline. We do expect it will grow sequentially. And then in terms of price sensitivity, we see the greatest impact in the Commercial space. Consumer price increases have taken hold, and we continue to perform very well in the Consumer space. I think Consumer revenue is up 14% year-over-year even though we have done price increases. So it's much more in the Commercial space. And our view is that -- as we mentioned on the Q2 call, that it would take a quarter for them to kind of catch up. And we did see some of that in Q3, hence some of the sequential improvement in operating profit for Personal Systems.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And can you share some metrics around the A3 success thus far? I know it's early, but any color on how many partners you've ramped? Any customer numbers? And then as you think about this going forward and we try to track the business, are you planning to break out any metrics more consistently so we can monitor how the business scales?
Dion Weisler: We don't release a lot of detail around the business for obvious competitive reasons, but what I would tell you and to give you a little bit of color is that I'm very encouraged by the initial progress. I'm excited by our future in this $55 billion market. We only have 6% share of this $55 billion market in the last quarter. It was our first full quarter of shipments. The customer reception is particularly positive and particularly positive around our security message, having the most secure printers on the market as well as the choices that are available to our customers from a technology perspective. They're able to choose both ink-based solutions and laser-based solutions. We are -- as it relates to go to market, we're ahead on our partner on-boarding targets across all 3 regions, across transactional managed print service channels as well as the traditional copier partners that we were looking to on-board. The pipeline is very strong. We have a very clear ambition to be a relevant A3 player, and we're on track to doing that. If we can add just 10 points of revenue share in the next 3 to 5 years or so, that's $5.5 billion of top line and the associated OP drop. So encouraged with our first full quarter start here.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me just add, Dion mentioned that we had 6% share. That is up both year-on-year and sequentially, a point or a little over a point. So that's one of the metrics you can absolutely see externally and track as we make progress here.
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Dion, you mentioned reinvention a few times, and that's your tagline that we've written about and have some interest in. Regarding that, first of all, what's changed? Parent HP tried to kind of get back to the invent idea without a lot of success. What's different about what you're doing particularly in terms of the new product pipeline? And then second, why should investors be excited about this? I remember when the split first happened, a number of HPQ investors were kind of saying, "I don't want to hear about growth. I just want the cash flow." What gives you confidence you'll get a substantial return on capital on your investment in the new product areas?
Dion Weisler: That's a great question. And the way we think about it is to anchor ourselves in our strategy, which straddles multiple time periods. The core is all about the here and now. It's our core businesses of Printing and Personal Systems. We have to be excellent in the core. I would say we're doing a lot of things differently right across the company. We begin our journey through customer insights, and we've really bolstered our customer insights team, listening to our customers, working with our customers to help define and build our products. Then we go to work on the cost associated with those products, the full bill of materials, taking out the cost that we can and adding in the sprinkles of magic that delight our customers. And that's across the entire portfolio, both Printing and Personal Systems. The third thing we've done differently is really put a focus on design. Design really matters in a OneLife world. Whether it's the design of our award-winning x360 or our new Sprocket printer that is the sprocket for your pocket. We really do think about how customers use our products every single day. And then we think about what really concerns customers, what's most on their mind. Things like security. It's a dangerous world out there. And for us to have the most secure printers and personal systems on the market is important to our customers, therefore it's important to us, and we invest heavily in that area. And then right across the company, we reinvent all of our processes. We take out nonrevenue-generating costs in our business that allows us to continue to innovate across the core but also invest in our future growth areas. And we only have 3 of those. We have our A3 business that we see as a $55 billion opportunity; we have our graphics business, which continues to grow; and commercial mobility. And that's over the next 2 to 3 years. And the third time horizon is, obviously, that sort of fleet of 10 years-plus where we contemplate our future around immersive computing and 3D printing where we've got some very strong indicators as we release our new 3D printers into the market globally.
Operator: The next question will be from Jim Suva of Citigroup.
Jim Suva: I have a question and a follow-up, and I'll ask them both at the same time. The first question is I think, Cathie, in her prepared remarks mentioned that the goal is to have printers that consume more ink and more NPV and that yield itself to more Consumer -- I'm sorry, more Commercial growth over Consumer growth. But Cathie, if I look back, it looks like the past 3 quarters or so, Consumer unit have meaningfully outgrown Commercial units. And maybe -- I don't know if that's due to Sprocket or something else there, but it looks like while the goal is to grow the Commercial, it looks like actually Consumer has been growing much faster. And then the follow-up question is on the seasonality for PCs, you mentioned the market will still grow, but you'll undergrow normal seasonal. Do you expect to lose share this quarter? Or why do you think you'll be below seasonal? Is that because of pricing action? And do you think you'll maintain share or lose or cede some share?
Catherine Lesjak: So Jim, let me take the second one first, just to make sure that we're all communicating well. What I said was that our business in Personal Systems would grow slower than normal seasonality for our business. We have been outgrowing the market by quite a bit. So I don't expect that we will lose share even though our revenue will be a little bit behind normal seasonality.
Dion Weisler: And as it relates to printer hardware, obviously, not all print units are created equally. And I mentioned a couple of data points earlier, there's certain segments of the Commercial market that we are very interested in, the growth in office A4 laser, which comes with that high usage is very important to us. The double-digit growth in multifunction value is also very important to us. Obviously, ramping the A3 market goes without saying. And it means not abandoning our traditional home ink markets. We have done very well there with the release of new desktop printers as well as the Sprocket, which is obviously exciting a customer that, in many cases, have never had access to print in the past. The subsegment of demographics that are buying sprockets are largely millennials, in many cases their first print experience. And what they're finding is that they store what they like and they print what they love.
Operator: The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and a follow-up. First on the question, I know you talked about currency really not having an impact in Q4 because of the way hedges work for HP. But if we just step back from that, I think entering fiscal '16, you talked about a currency headwind of $0.34 to EPS for HP when the dollar was at 3% to 4% headwind. I think spot rates would point to $1 being a 2% tailwind for fiscal '18, which if you just did sort of the blind linear math would suggest you should have a $0.15 to $0.20 benefit looking forward. So I understand hedges need to roll off, and that's why you don't really expect much impact in Q4. But as we just think about currency more broadly looking forward, given we saw a really material hurt in '16, why couldn't we see a really material benefit looking forward as spot rates stay where they are? And I have a follow-up, please.
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, we'll talk more about '18, obviously, at the Security Analyst Meeting in October. But I think one of the things that needs to be brought into that analysis is what's going to happen in the market from a pricing perspective. We've now seen in fiscal '17 pretty significant price increases. And so if there is a tailwind from currency in '18, my -- our expectation is that prices are going to have to come down pretty significantly to relieve some of the pressure that's building because we've been increasing prices this year. And so then it's going to be, ultimately, what is the total impact is going to be how many price declines do you have to do and what impact does that have on both revenue and EPS.
Dion Weisler: I'm going to tell you I spent my life in sales, a large part of it in any case. And one of the hardest things that any salesperson ever has to do is to stand in front of a customer and convince them why their price has to go up, either through [ cost currency ] or cost headwinds or other issues that impact the business. So I think Christoph, Nick and Richard, our 3 regional presidents, along with their sales team have done an outstanding job in doing that repricing. But as you get in front of those customers, whilst they understand for the large part that they have to pay more for the products that they receive and they see the value in their products, they expect that as currency goes the other way that you equally reprice the products as well. And I think that's very much worth keeping in mind. As we head into the Security Analyst Meeting. we'll talk more about it.
Toni Sacconaghi: And then just to follow up, in your guidance for Q4, you've talked about PCs being up sequentially although not as much. Typically, the Printing business is also up, and yet the midpoint of your EPS guidance is up only fractionally. I'm wondering if you can comment about whether there are any assumptions for Samsung accretion or dilution that are embedded in your Q4 guidance or how specifically you might be thinking about component costs or other operating profit forces at work on Q4. Because I think just at a high level, given that revenue should grow between Q3 and Q4, I probably would've expected a little more EPS upside.
Catherine Lesjak: So first on the Samsung part of your question, Toni, we don't expect that Samsung is going to close until calendar Q4, so we do not expect it in our fiscal Q4. And so I think that's important. It will be -- Q4 will be without Samsung. And then in terms of kind of the puts and takes of the sequential view, probably, the 2 biggest things to call out, first  is commodity costs. We do expect commodity cost to go up sequentially, and so that will be a bit of a headwind. But probably, the bigger impact is just the opportunity that we see to place more positive NPV units. And so that's really what is kind of the biggest impact sequentially on EPS -- I'm sorry, relative to normal seasonality.
Operator: The next question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Can you talk a bit more about the underlying dynamics of the supplies revenue growth you saw and that you're expecting? And specifically, I'm thinking about, between ink and toner, how the growth in Commercial print, which is mainly ink, is maybe mixing it a little bit toward ink. I don't know if that doesn't work because of the offset of Consumer but obviously, with the higher margin benefit from ink, I'm just wondering how we should sort of think about what's going on there below the 2% growth.
Catherine Lesjak: So Shannon, I think it's a bit difficult. I don't -- we don't break out kind of that level of detail. What we have talked about is obviously our Commercial. Our Commercial business is bigger because of the usage than our Consumer business. And therefore, you'll see a difference in toner and ink as a result of that. Although just to be clear, some of the Consumer now has our low-end laser in it. So when we talk about our home print system, it includes low-end laser. But ultimately, what's going to drive the supplies is really the 4-box model drivers. So it's really -- it's not ink or toner. It's really about driving across the 4 boxes, focusing on placing the right units, the high-quality units, working on your installed base, working on, obviously, our market share or aftermarket market share as well as the pricing related to supplies.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I guess I had a follow-up on the commodity side. Cathie, you had mentioned you expect commodity costs to actually go up in the fiscal fourth quarter. I know some people that we've talked to are thinking more flat, so I'm just trying to figure out is that a reflection of contracts going off that are going to reset? Or are there specific areas where you think that you're going to need to buy more? And also, is this -- any of that reflected in what's going on in your inventory in this quarter as well?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So I'm not aware of other views that say it's going to be flat. We actually think it's going to continue to go up but at a slower rate. This is particularly true from a DRAM perspective. And then when you step back and you look at it, kind of Q4 versus Q3, in the course of Q3, the commodity prices continue to go up. So of course, that will represent a headwind for us in Q4. But we do expect some additional increases in commodities in Q4 as well.
Dion Weisler: The other thing I would add to that, Shannon, is that staying out in front of these cost increases and being proactive has really worked for us. We called this particular issue well before our competitors and we took very early action here, and we did not get caught behind the curve. The other thing we did is we took some strategic decisions to leverage the balance sheet. We secured inventory as our highest priority, and you heard me talk about that in the last couple of earnings calls because that then at least gives the opportunity for the sales team to go out and reprice our products. If you don't have them because you haven't gone and secured them in a tough buying environment, then obviously, you have not opportunity there. So we're very predictable for our suppliers, that helps them through a time when they have to put up their cost and they were in shortage. And then of course, as I mentioned before, the team went out. The sales team, the category team did an excellent job of repricing the products. And our customers still see a lot of value in the incredible innovation that's going into them.
Operator: The next question will be from Abhey Lamba of Mizuho.
Abhey Lamba: Cathie, you mentioned the price increases are impacting commercial PC demand, and that's also the market where we have aging hardware installed base. So how do you think it plays out? Do you think it pushes out demand until prices become more reasonable in their mind? Or will there be pricing pressures where we would see unit sales for that lower price? How do you expect the commercial demand to kind of play out from here on out?
Dion Weisler: I think you've got to take a several quarter view of the personal systems market. I think the first thing that's important to remember is it's still a $333 billion market, and about 1 in 5 machines have got an HP logo and it's very quickly becoming 1 in 4, we're creeping up there, that the top 4 players including us, in aggregate, grew 1%. And we grew a 5-point premium to that. So the big are getting bigger, and we're growing much faster than the big 4 in total. And that's really off the back of innovation. That's what we're focused on, is delighting our customers and surprising them and amazing them with our products. And I think we have the best product line we've ever had, and that's picked up quite regularly now by third-party reviewers that look at our products relative to our competitors. For us, it's about driving a continuous transformation of the business to more profitable subcategories where we can get value for that innovation. In quarter 3, that paid off again. We did have incredible top line growth of 12%, sequential growth in operating profit as well as share gains. But just recall that share gains are not the objective but rather the outcome. There's no magic pill here. I don't think the markets as they move from quarter-to-quarter ever really are given a magic pill except for when it's sort of like the last month or 2 before an operating system changes over. This was broad based across all categories, all regions. Desktops back to growth as well. Channel inventory, aged inventory, very well managed. A lot of kudos to our team in all the regions in the business unit in the supply chain and the functions. And I think we're in a very good position to compete as we go forward as the various dynamics play out in the market.
Catherine Lesjak: And the other thing I would add is that I was asked to make a relative comment and we saw Consumer revenue this year -- or this quarter grow 14% year-over-year and Commercial, 11%. Last quarter, we said that the Commercial price increases were going to take a while to work their way through, and we saw some of that pick up in Q3. So I wouldn't -- I'm not suggesting that Commercial customers are completely sitting on the sidelines at all. I think that with our great product line up, we're certainly able to make the sales that we need to make in that space and get them off kind of the fence.
Operator: The next question will be from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I guess I had one accounting question for Cathie and then a follow-up to that. So I noticed that the other income expense last year in the fiscal fourth quarter was a pretty big negative number, Cathie. And I wonder if you could just kind of help us understand what that might look like this year and also may be comment on interest income expense, how that -- how you would expect that to come out in the fiscal fourth quarter of this year. And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So let's just make sure we're level set. So what I have is for OI&E last year was a negative $65 million in Q3 and for this year, it's a negative $66 million. So I don't see a real big difference there on a year-over-year basis? Are you looking at a full year basis -- pardon me?
Rod Hall: Yes, I was referring to the October quarter of last year. So last year, the October quarter, other income and expense, I see a minus 435. Do you have a different number?
Catherine Lesjak: Sorry, I'm not -- I haven't been focused on Q4 last year. I don't remember off the top of my head what happened last. Can we take that offline? And I can look it up and maybe even while we're talking here, I can look it up, but I haven't focused on it.
Rod Hall: Okay. Yes, because it's been a big fluctuation last year so I just wanted to make sure that -- just to understand if it was likely to do that again this year from a modeling point of view. And then on OpEx, OpEx numbers were a little higher than we had modeled. Maybe we just mismodeled it in July, but just wanted to understand in the October guidance, what you're thinking in terms of operating margins and OpEx.
Catherine Lesjak: I'm sorry, can you say that again?
Rod Hall: I was just wondering on the October guidance, if you could talk a little bit about what you're thinking, what you're thinking in terms of operating margins and OpEx and what some of the drivers of that might be.
Catherine Lesjak: So the big drivers off of normal sequential performance from Q3 to Q4 is basically the units that we expect to be able to place. We have made great progress in our Printing business on our cost structure, and that is enabling us to go into the market and find opportunities that used to be negative NPV opportunities that are now positive NPV opportunities, and we expect to take advantage of those opportunities. That's the biggest reason for not being a normal sequential. The other is that we do have commodity cost increases that we see in Personal Systems. We don't guide at a OpEx or an operating profit level.
Rod Hall: Okay. Since I missed the first one Cathie, could I just ask you to comment a little bit on how far out you're hedged on commodities? Are you guys pretty well-hedged looking forward? Or will you have to add to inventory over time to protect yourself from commodity prices in the future?
Catherine Lesjak: So we will -- we are very fairly well hedged in the sense that we have a fair amount of inventory, strategic by inventory, but that's never for multiple quarters or has never been for multiple quarters. And so we will absolutely face increasing commodity cost both in Q4, to some extent, and into '18.
Operator: The next question will be from -- and the last question, I apologize, will be from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital.
Ananda Baruah: Cathie, just going back to the normalized though, about the free cash flow question. From before your comments around sort of normalized not being applicable today as it used to be, do you feel that maybe with what's going on in sort of higher-quality supplies and ongoing traction in PCs that the cash conversion cycle could actually be in the process of redefining itself? And if you think that maybe it is, how would you like us to kind of think about that?
Catherine Lesjak: I don't really think of the cash conversion cycle as redefining itself. So this quarter, very pleased with the performance. We had a cash conversion cycle of minus 35 days, which was 5 days better sequentially. But as I mentioned, that was really driven by the incredible strength and sequential performance of the Personal Systems business. Because the Personal Systems business has such a negative cash conversion cycle that when it grows, its growth increases sequentially. You're going to see a fair amount of free cash flow. Similarly, if the growth is less in the following -- in the next quarter sequentially, you're actually going to see a little bit of a reduction in free cash flow. What we expect for this year is that we would do at least $3 billion in free cash flow. So making great progress on free cash flow. And that our cash conversion cycle would likely end the year at a minus 29 days, kind of in line with FY '16's exit. And I think of that more as kind of the range that I would be modeling over the longer term.
Dion Weisler: So I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. The key takeaways I'd love you to leave the call with is the following: we stabilized revenue a quarter earlier than we expected; we posted double-digit total revenue growth in the quarter; we delivered non-GAAP EPS at the high end of our outlook range; and we generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow. We have growth across all segments and regions and sustained success across the 3 time horizons of our core growth and future pillars. And that's really important in the way we're delivering for today, by providing real opportunity for long-term growth into the future. Everyday, we wake up knowing that we need to amaze our customers and partners with the most competitive disruptive portfolio. It's job #1 for us. Very proud of the outstanding execution of the strategy from the team and believe that our very best days still lie ahead of us. I look forward to seeing you all at SAM on Thursday, October 12 in Palo Alto. Thanks very much for your time.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2017 Q2  (2017-05-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2017 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Austin, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Steve Fieler, Head of Treasury. Please proceed.
Steve Fieler: Good afternoon. I'm Steve Fieler, Head of Treasury for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2017 second quarter earnings conference call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com.

For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2017, and HP's other SEC filings. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our quarterly performance. It was a breakthrough quarter where we delivered year-over-year growth in both Personal Systems and Print. As a company, we're performing across our portfolio, our regions and our key financial metrics. Over the last 6 quarters, we've been building momentum, improving our business fundamentals and delivering on what we said we would do. We're taking profitable share, out-executing our competitors and delivering some of the best innovation, design and execution in HP's history. Our goal is to consistently deliver on our financial commitments every quarter, while setting the company up for long-term success. We are strengthening our core business and delivering on milestones in our growth and future initiatives. I'm proud of the results this quarter. Let me talk through a few of the highlights. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40, at the high end of our outlook range. We grew net revenue by 7% year-over-year to $12.4 billion, driven by growth in Personal Systems and Print, the first time we've delivered growth in both segments during the same quarter since Q4 of 2010. We delivered free cash flow of approximately $400 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the first half of the fiscal year. Through the same year-to-date time period, we returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Looking at the business segment performance, Personal Systems continued to deliver and demonstrate how playing our game drives strong results. The team, once again, drove revenue growth year-over-year and market share expansion. We saw a small increase in operating profit dollars year-over-year at a time when significant component cost headwinds have been pervasive across the industry. This is a great example of how segmenting market opportunities, innovating and executing can yield amazing results. For the second consecutive quarter, Personal Systems revenue grew by 10% year-over-year. And importantly, once again, this is broad-based growth across all 3 regions, both Consumer and Commercial audiences and in Notebook and Workstation categories. In calendar quarter 1, we beat the year-over-year PC market unit growth by 12 points, once again outperforming all key competitors and the market as a whole. We achieved 21.7% global market share and regained the #1 PC market position globally. Remember that market share leadership is an outcome, not an objective. Our ability to gain profitable share is one of the true measures of success. Today, security is top of mind for consumers and the boardroom alike. Just look at the cybersecurity events over the past couple of weeks. With this backdrop, we continue to deliver the most secure and manageable PCs in the world, with powerful new Commercial Notebooks and Desktops, including the EliteBook x360 with HP Sure View and HP Sure Click. As part of our world-class security stack, Sure View defends customers from visual hacking, with a built-in electronic privacy screen. HP Sure Click protects customers and organizations from web-based security threats including malware and other viruses that we are all seeing daily in the news. We also announced HP Sure Start, the world's only integrated browsing solution which protects our devices from malware. In addition to security, mobility is a top priority for our customers and a differentiator for HP. At Mobile World Congress, we introduced the latest HP Pro x2, with the design, security and productivity features tailored for today's mobile workforce. This discerning audience took notice honoring the Pro x2 with several important awards including a category Best of Show, Top Pick and Top Innovation. While the PC market has been healthier than expected during the past few quarters, the market remains highly competitive and volatile. Regardless of market conditions, I remain confident in our team's ability to deliver consistent results through a relentless focus on innovation, market segmentation and cost management. And whether it's a virtual-reality backpack, an OMEN gaming system, a DreamColor display or a premium PC, we are winning hearts and minds with the sleekest and most desirable products we have ever created. I am truly proud of what we've achieved in Personal Systems and energized by the focus, energy and talent of our people who know how to combine innovation with incredible execution. Shifting to Printing. Enrique and his team had a breakthrough quarter, with strong performance across multiple dimensions: total revenue, supplies revenue, units, market share and operating profit. Printing revenue grew 2% year-over-year with both hardware and supplies revenue growing in the same quarter for the first time since Q2 of 2011. Units also grew year-over-year as did our market share, while delivery operating profit expansion. It's been a long time since we've been able to say that, especially in a single quarter, and we're excited to be igniting a real renaissance in Printing. With solid progress on our productivity initiatives which lowers our overall cost structure, we remain better positioned to competitively price and place more units with a positive NPV. Due in part to our continued operational progress, hardware units were up 4% in Q2, our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year unit growth. The overall Print hardware market was up slightly in calendar quarter 1, a bit better than expected. We continued to grow faster than the market with year-over-year profitable share gains in both our home and office businesses. I'm pleased that our supplies performance strengthened this quarter with revenue up 2% year-over-year. We continued to pull the levers within the Four Box Model, and when combined with our operational progress, both are having a favorable impact on the business. In addition to improvements in our core Printing business, we have also built momentum in strategic growth areas. Our Graphics business delivered another strong performance with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 15th consecutive quarter. We saw balanced hardware revenue growth across the portfolio as well as in graphic supplies and services. Similarly, we saw growth in contractual printing, with continued increases in new total contract value for Managed Print Services. We also grew Consumer enrollment in Instant Ink and continued to expand into new geographies. At the end of Q2, we began shipping our disruptive portfolio of A3 multifunction printers. In contrast to the established copier players, our new A3 portfolio is expected to transform the copier experience for customers and service professionals. Our differentiation includes a lower total cost of ownership, improved serviceability and the most advanced security and device uptime. Our journey is just beginning, and we are aggressively onboarding new partners and attacking new opportunities in the $55 billion A3 copier market. The acquisition of Samsung's Printing business will further accelerate our A3 portfolio. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of '17, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Turning to 3D Printing. This was our second quarter of product shipments, and the feedback from our customers and partners is very encouraging. Across the board, we're building momentum and advancing the entire ecosystem. This month at Rapid, the largest 3D printing conference in the world, we announced a series of important milestones, including a reseller program with more than 30 partners. More than a dozen 3D reference and experience centers across North America and Europe, a growing roster of manufacturing service bureaus and product development customers implementing HP Jet Fusion 3D Printing systems for production and new applications. And we expanded our open materials platform to include new partners like Henkel, a global leader in high-performance adhesive technologies. Also, just this past weekend at the inaugural 3D Printing Industry Awards, HP's Multi Jet Fusion technology was recognized as the Innovation of the Year. Disrupting the $12 trillion manufacturing sector and transforming industries is a long-term vision, and one that we are making concrete strategic progress on today. This is a multiyear journey, and I'm confident in this team's ability to bring disruptive innovation to market, create and empower an ecosystem and redefine the economics of production manufacturing. To summarize, Q2 was a breakthrough quarter for us, with strong year-over-year performance across our segments and regions. We're executing, meeting our commitments and capitalizing on our momentum. We are also making the right investment decisions for the long term. However, our work never ends. Every single day, we must continue to amaze our customers and partners with the most competitive and disruptive portfolio in our industry, and provide them with meaningful value and opportunity. Change is a constant in our business, and to us, change equals opportunity. We know how to operate in up and down markets that we will continue to face and are prepared to tackle the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. By embracing change, we have an opportunity to accelerate, to innovate, to improve and ultimately, to reinvent for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details and our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Overall, I am also very pleased with our performance in the second quarter. We delivered net revenue of $12.4 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Similar to the broad-based performance we delivered last quarter, we saw strong momentum globally, with each region delivering top line growth year-over-year and both EMEA and APJ growing about 10% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.2% was down 0.2 points year-over-year, driven primarily by strong Personal Systems growth and higher commodity costs in Personal Systems, partially offset by Print margins. Sequentially, gross margin was up 1.5 points, higher than normal seasonality, driven by favorable print margins combined with strong sequential growth in Printing and resulting segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were up 7% year-over-year. The expense increase was driven by SG&A, where the year-over-year reported growth was impacted by the gains or offsets to SG&A expense that were recognized in FY '16 for the divestiture of certain marketing optimization assets. In addition, SG&A increased year-over-year as we drove more demand generation and marketing initiatives primarily in Print. We also continue to invest more in research and development year-over-year. These R&D investments are important drivers to fuel future innovation. Net OI&E expense was $69 million for the quarter. As a reminder, in the year-over-year compare, last year, we recorded a onetime gain of about $0.03 in OI&E from a favorable litigation settlement. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 22% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.40. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $140 million and acquisition-related charges of $20 million, partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $35 million, cash indemnification credits of $5 million and the related tax impact on these charges. In Q2, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.33. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year. We saw strong performance across both customer segments, with Consumer revenue up 16% and Commercial up 7% year-over-year. While share performance is not our first priority, our disciplined focus on market segmentation and innovation enabled meaningful year-over-year unit and revenue share gains in calendar Q1 across Consumer and Commercial. PC average selling prices were up year-over-year and sequentially, driven by favorable pricing and to a lesser extent, a mix shift to premium, partially offset by currency. As we highlighted last quarter, we took pricing actions globally in response to unfavorable currency and the increased cost of components. However, the potential impact on demand and full benefit of these price increases takes time to play through, especially in Commercial. As such, gross margins were down both year-over-year and sequentially in Q2 driven by the continued component cost headwinds and currency, which weren't fully mitigated by the higher average selling prices. The team delivered a 3.2% operating profit margin, down 0.3 points year-over-year. We continued to make progress beyond the core with a focus on strategic growth category. In Q2, we saw strong growth in premium, Commercial mobility and Commercial services. Turning to Printing. We remain on track to deliver operational improvements in the core business, while making progress on our growth initiatives. Revenue was $4.7 billion in the quarter, up 2% year-over-year. Hardware units were up 4% year-over-year, with growth in our Consumer and Commercial categories, up 3% and 6%, respectively. Our total unit growth includes HP Sprocket, our handheld photo printer, which continued to have strong demand and contributed to our year-over-year metric. In calendar Q1, we gained share year-over-year in both our home and office businesses, with overall print share up 0.5 points. Overall, print hardware revenue was up 7% year-over-year, supported by increased volume and higher average selling prices, driven by both rate and mix improvements. We continue to be focused on improving our cost structure, which will enable us to place more NPV-positive units, driving these positive NPV unit placements is one of the many levers to help ensure ongoing supplies revenue stabilization. In our growth initiatives, graphics had another strong quarter, growing revenue across all regions and nearly in all product categories, with strong performance in Indigo. Managed Print Service's new TCV was again up year-over-year. And as Dion highlighted, we shipped our first new A3 printers at the end of Q2 and look forward to scaling the business in the quarters ahead. In Q2, total supplies revenue was up 2% nominally and in constant currency, the first quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth since Q2 2013. The year-over-year increase associated with the Four Box Model drivers was better than we expected. We have clear line of sight to supply stabilization and expect second half supplies revenue growth to be flat to slightly up year-over-year in constant currency and adjusted for last year's changes to the supplies sales model. Supplies revenue mix was 67%, flat year-over-year, and channel inventory remains below our reduced ceiling. We saw good improvement in Printing operating profit at 17.4%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and 1.4 points sequentially. Margin increases were driven by favorable rate due to a mix shift to the high end of Consumer and ongoing cost structure improvements, partially offset by increased marketing spend and investments in key growth initiatives. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $455 million in Q2 and approximately $1.2 billion year-to-date. Free cash flow was $380 million in the quarter and approximately $1.1 billion year-to-date. As highlighted last quarter, we had expected Q2 free cash flow to be below Q1, primarily due to the sequential changes in revenue, volume and mix from our respective segments. The cash conversion cycle was negative 30 days, flat sequentially. Quarter-to-quarter, we saw a 2-day increase in days sales outstanding, driven by less favorable revenue linearity which is more typical of normal seasonality. Days inventory increased 4 days, primarily driven by strategic buys to help assure component supply. And finally, we saw a 6-day increase in days of payable, driven by purchasing linearity and more normal sequential changes. On a full year basis, we remain confident that the revenue linearity improvements we saw in the first half resulting from changes to our supply sales model are structural improvements. Therefore, we continue to expect that our free cash flow could be at the higher end of our $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion outlook for the year. During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $447 million through share repurchases and cash dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned 95% of free cash flow as compared to our full year target of 50% to 75% so we remain well on track to deliver on this commitment. Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook: for the full year, we are on track to deliver our productivity initiatives as announced at SAM. We have accelerated the timing of certain restructuring charges from fiscal 2018, where the incremental 2017 GAAP expenses will be offset by lower 2018 GAAP expenses. Many of these restructuring charges are lumpy in nature and the timing is more difficult to predict, which leads to keeping a wider full year GAAP outlook range relative to our narrowed non-GAAP range. In Personal Systems, we have increased pricing globally in response to the increased cost of components and unfavorable currency impacts, which could have a more significant impact on demand and operating margins than we've assumed. For Printing, we expect supplies revenue to be flat to slightly up in the second half in constant currency and adjusted for last year's supply sales model change. We also expect to continue placing units with a positive NPV. With all that in mind, Q3 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.40 to $0.43; Q3 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. We are raising our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.66. And our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: It's nice to see both PCs and Printing growing again. So my first question is on the PC market. I'd like to follow up on the comments regarding price increases. What have you seen initially from the market, and perhaps, on a geographic basis? And then also what are you seeing from your competitors? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So Shannon, let me start with what we're -- what we did. So we increased prices in both Q1 and Q2. In Q2, what we saw was the Consumer price increase basically take and flow through in the quarter so it has a much quicker impact than on the Commercial side. Commercial, that takes some time to actually work through the system so we didn't see that as much in Q2. We do expect that we will see the price increase flow through in Q3. But the flip side of that is, of course, we didn't see the demand impact either of that price increase. So at this point in time, there's a little bit of uncertainty as to what we will see kind of into Q3 and Q4 from those price increases in Commercial.
Dion Weisler: And Shannon, the only other thing I would add is that I think we saw this relatively early. I believe, I mentioned it a couple of quarters ago. And as a result of that, the first thing we did was went and shored up supply for the full year because we wanted to make sure that we were able to fulfill the demand that we're seeing flow through the pipeline. With that said, it becomes a constant, daily set of work that the team does to continue to work costs down in other areas of the business, in the complete bill of materials, in the workflow that we drive every single day. So we saw this coming. I think we reacted to it, and we're leveraging our balance sheet to ensure that we have surety of supply.
Shannon Cross: And then second question is just on the Printing operating margin. Supplies seem to be improving a little bit ahead of schedule which obviously is going to benefit margins. But I'm curious how you think about sort of the balance of flow-through of investment of those dollars into 3D Printing, A3, other growth initiatives versus letting it fall to the bottom line. So how are you balancing that? And how should we think about operating margin as you go through the year?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think the way to think about it, and we talked about this before, is that the we expect that the Print operating margin, which have historically been in the mid-teens, will continue to be in the mid-teens. That's kind of 15% to 18%. And that the variability within that range is largely going to be driven by the opportunity to place more units. For '17 specifically, we're very focused on our productivity initiatives and bringing those -- realizing those as we progress through the year. We are also taking some of the savings, a lot of the savings, frankly, that we're getting from lower discount dollars around supplies directly related to the supplies sales model change that we made last year, and we're basically reinvesting those back into marketing. We told you we were going to do that, and that is in fact what is happening. We're doing that in order to drive Print relevancy, drive more Print and also to drive preference for HP-branded supplies. And then finally, we are investing. We're investing in A3, we're investing in graphics and we're investing in 3D.
Operator: And our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Cathie, on the supply side, just to clarify, again, you talked about flat to up in the second half including the adjustment for last year. So I take that to mean that the reported number will be something up like 5%. I just want to clarify that. And do you have any view on what the longer-term supplies growth rate is likely to be? Or will there be any growth in supplies?
Catherine Lesjak: So to the first part of your question, the second half. Yes, the reported numbers will be higher from a growth perspective in the second half because we had such a significant adjustment to channel inventories in last year's second half. And in terms of kind of the longer-term view of supplies, I think one of the things that we've been saying pretty consistently is that getting to supply stabilization in constant currency and, again, adjusted for these sales model changes, is the first milestone. It's not that in Q1 we then breathe a sigh of relief and we don't have to do it again. So we recognized that we are, at a minimum, maintaining the stabilization in constant currency in supplies over a longer time period. Exactly what that's going to look like, we'll talk more at our Security Analyst Meeting later on in the fall.
Steven Milunovich: Okay. And Dion, I wanted to ask you about the A3 market. I think you've said that you're not really a player unless you're at about a 10% market share. Do you have a sense of when you're going to get there? And are you finding that you're able to develop the channels that you need?
Dion Weisler: So I will reaffirm that I think to be relevant in any marketplace that you want to have at least a 10% market share. Then you become relevant to channel -- particularly in a channel-driven business, you become relevant to those channel partners and relevant to customers. And so we want to get there as quickly as possible. Having said that, we've only just started to ship our range of A3 products. And we are excited by the reaction to the products that we've already delivered. The pipeline is very healthy. We are onboarding both existing partners and a very new universe of partners that we've never transacted with in the past. The additional benefit of that is as we take on these new channel partners, we're finding additional A4 opportunities within the new -- within the new partner base and within customers that we've never dealt with in the past because they have a blended mix of A3 and A4. So this is ongoing work. It's early days. I'm excited by what I'm seeing across the globe in terms of the commitment to driving our A3 business, and we'll continue to remain focused on it.
Operator: Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, you beat our free cash flow estimates the past 2 quarters. Why not raise the range for the sort of full year? Is there anything coming in the back half? I mean, certainly, the component environment will [indiscernible], so I imagine inventory remains high. I know there's an SAP upgrade that you're either in the midst of or is upcoming. Are there any dynamics in the back half that keep you conservative on the free cash flow? Then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: I don't think there's anything that is out of the ordinary that's coming up in the back half that is keeping us conservative, to use your words. I think it's more that we typically don't update our free cash flow guidance in the year. We kind of put out a rate -- a range out there and we kind of stick to it and then we give a little bit of color. And so the color that I've given is that, frankly, I do think we could be at the higher end and we'll see. Now there's also a lot of volatility in free cash flow as a result of kind of what the business does, okay? So if you've got print -- in this quarter, we had print increasing sequentially much more than is kind of their normal pattern. Similarly, we had Personal Systems out of their norm as well. They decreased more than is the norm. And so that can have a pretty big swing or a pretty big impact on free cash flow. So there is a little bit of that, that we're playing through as well. That could mean that if we could me higher, it could mean that we are a bit lower in the range.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay, understood. And as a follow up, what percentage of the PC and printer business is now as a service? And are there any implications as it relates to CapEx or timing of payments from customers that could change the free cash flow model longer term?
Catherine Lesjak: So the contractual piece of our business is not that significant today to be putting any kind of real pressure on free cash flow or on CapEx in general, so I don't think that that's a concern of ours. It is moving in the direction, it is growing and we like the fact that it's growing but we don't see a significant impact from it in fiscal '17.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have one for you, Cathie, and one for Dion. So just you had talked about how we should think about adjusting supplies growth rate for drawdowns in channel inventory. And last year in fiscal Q2, you said that supplies were negatively impacted by 7% from a drawdown in channel inventory, which would point to about a $250 million drawdown in inventory last year in Q2. So if we add that back to last year, it actually looks like, on an inventory-adjusted basis, supplies were down 5% or 6% this quarter in Q2. Is that the right way to think about it? Or were there's some supplies inventory drawdowns this quarter?
Catherine Lesjak: So there were also year-on-year inventory drawdowns this quarter. If you think about the fact that we did that pretty significant step-down in channel inventory Q3 and Q4 of last year and then we have continued to keep channel inventory kind of at those levels or even in a little bit lower. I think in Q1 I mentioned that sequentially we were down in terms of [indiscernible], we're down again both year-over-year and sequentially. And so there is a little bit of an add back as a result of those drawdowns in channel inventory.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. We can take it off-line, But I think unless it came down this quarter, it doesn't really matter because I'm comparing 13 weeks of sell-out this quarter versus effectively 12 weeks of sell-out last quarter, and that's where I got the differential. If it came down in the interim, I don't think it really matters but I'm happy to kind of debate that off-line. Dion, on my second question, you've done a great job in PCs in being a sustainable share gain or I think it's been like almost 20 quarters. Your strong growth rate now is benefiting from really good share gains. But the market is still pretty weak and quite frankly, your year-over-year comparison was pretty easy, it was minus 10%. So as we look to the back half of the year, particularly the fourth quarter when the Personal Systems comparison goes to plus 4% and you've expressed some hesitation about price increases and how that might impact demand, is it realistic to think that HP can continue to grow PC revenues in the third and fourth quarters? And how do we think about the trade-off between like a 4% operating margin or revenue growth in your eyes, and how do you think about that?
Dion Weisler: Thanks for the question, Toni. Let me just say that -- I mean, as you know, we don't guide revenue. But what I will tell you is that we don't broadly disagree with how the industry analysts view the PC market. We look back 18 months ago and we were in double-digit declines. And since that time, the market's been steadily improving to the point where it grew this quarter. And depending on which analyst you speak to, they're sort of in the range of between minus 2 and plus 2. And we don't broadly disagree with that range through the remainder of the year. What I will say is that I'm very confident in our team's ability to out execute the market and out execute our competitors and we do that with a fairly complex formula of segmenting the market, segmenting it again, finding the pockets of growth within the market using fairly sophisticated heat maps and understanding where we believe the heat is going to be in the market. And we know that we can't cut our way to glory, that we need to innovate our way to success. So we spend a lot of time and energy on innovation that matters to our customers. We've spent a lot of -- as a good example, a lot of energy on security, multiple levels of security, below the operating system, at the operating system, above the operating system and we're seeing that really resonate with our customers right now. You have look at the last couple of weeks where there's been a lot of global security concerns and we've got a tremendous answer for that, and we're being rewarded for that innovation that we build into the product. So you can expect to see us continue to innovate. You can expect to see us continue to take cost out of the business. You can expect to see us continue to segment, drive to where the heat is in the market. It's a formula that's been working well for us as you pointed out at the start of your remarks. And I think when we do that, in a market that is sort of minus 2 to plus 2, depending on where you go, I think we can outperform the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Cathie, you mentioned that you're raising your full year non-GAAP EPS, which is good to see, but the GAAP has gone lower. And you mentioned something about restructuring. Is that accelerating, pulling them into this year and then you're going to see the benefits sooner than expected? Or how should we think about why there's a disconnect there and about the timing of the benefits of such?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So yes, we are pulling in restructuring from fiscal 2018 -- or at least some charges. I think the way to think about it is that we're pulling in charges from 2018 into 2017, and that is impacting the GAAP number. But it's also -- we've also got a wider GAAP range. And the reason we've got that is that some of these charges can be -- you determine what quarter you take them in by some very specific accounting rules. And sometimes that tips the scale as to what quarter it fits in. And I'll give you a really good example. This quarter, we closed -- we announced that we are closing Irish manufacturing. And there was this very detailed list of things that you had to check the box on in order to recognize the charge this quarter. It just as easily could have been basically recognized next quarter. If that happens in Q4, then we have something that falls out and we have something that falls in, so we've got a much wider range from a GAAP perspective. But in the big scheme of things, we are pulling in some of the restructuring charges into 2017. In terms of the benefits, really what we've talked about is that this restructuring program is a 3-year program, roughly $300 million to $500 million worth of charges over that time period. We still believe that we will be in that range. And that the savings, on a full year basis, would be $200 million to $300 million a year beginning in FY '20. And that -- that we continue to believe that's the case.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: I have just a couple of clarifications on margins going forward. On the Printing margins, it sounds like the supplies should be higher than the revenue mix. So should we expect Printing margins over the back half of the year to expand from this level or are there other puts and takes we should be aware of? And on the PC margins, is the current run rate reflective of the tightness and the cost -- and the component cost environment? And would you say this is a new base? Or are there cost initiatives that could take that up and ASPs increasing should help going forward? Or how should we think about the direction of those margins in the back half of the year?
Catherine Lesjak: Okay. So from a Print perspective, we still expected that Print margins will stay in kind of the mid-teens, 15% to 18%. The offset to what you're talking about in terms of maybe a bit of a tailwind from a supplies' perspective is the fact that we want to place as many NPV-positive units so that we keep the flywheel effect of placing units, getting supplies, placing units and getting supplies going. So that's kind of the optimization of the area under the curve that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting. On the Personal Systems, some of the margins -- some of the things you should think about, one is the Commercial price increases really -- haven't really shown up yet in Q2. Expect them to show up more in Q3, but we also are expecting there could be some demand response to that. And then on top of that, the commodity costs increased pretty significantly year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter in Q2. We expect that they're going to continue to increase, albeit at a slower rate, in Q3. So there will be an incremental headwind as a result of those commodity costs going up in Q3. And then we are -- just at a total company level, we've talked a lot about $1 billion in productivity initiatives that we've got going, and they ramp, they are ramping and are more back-end loaded, which we've been talking about most of the year.
Dion Weisler: And just for additional clarification to Toni's question and your question, we haven't really changed our view on the PC business. We think it's in the range between 3% and 4%.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: I guess, a couple of questions for me as well. Cathie, could you just talk about the cash conversion cycle and how you expect that to track in the back half? And I guess, looking at accounts payable getting to 100 days, is that something that's sustainable in your opinion? And on another side, I think inventory days went up as well. So do you think these just normalize each other and offset in the back half? Or is there room for conversion to actually improve, especially the [ DPO ] stay north of 100?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So I'm very pleased with the progress that we're making from a cash flow perspective. We, over the last probably year-ish, have been really driving cash flow in the company, at just about every level in the company. So employees really understand the importance of free cash flow, they understand what role they play in helping us to drive free cash flow, and I think of those as being really sustainable. Secondly, we did make a change to our supply sales model last year, and that is driving better linearity. Real structural, better linearity. Linearity in the quarter that mirrors the demand that we're seeing. And that has also then provided benefit because we're getting -- we're basically shipping revenues earlier in the quarter, beyond the fact that -- and we also do it at a lower discount level, and so that's real structural improvement. In the outlook that we provided for free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, and like I said, I think, frankly, we could be at the higher end as a result of the supplies change that we made. It has -- what's assumed in that is that we're -- our cash conversion cycle is flattish, maybe down 1 day or 2 within that range. And so I think that's the way to think about. Is it sustainable? It's probably going to be in the minus 28 to minus 30 kind of range.
Amit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And I guess, when you talk about these -- the Printing segment margin, and you said 15% to 18% is the target. Is that a reasonable target once the Samsung assets are rolled in and integrated as well? Or does that kind of dilute that a little bit at least in the initial part of it once you get the deal?
Catherine Lesjak: So Samsung is in investment mode right now as we talked about when we announced the Samsung deal. And then we also said on the call is that we would expect that the deal would be accretive in the first full year. So it starts out in investment mode and then kind of ramps from there. And that is not included in obviously any of our fiscal '17 outlooks at this point in time.
Operator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Dion, maybe you could talk about what you're seeing in HP original supplies attach? How has that evolved over the past year or so? How much more room do you see over the next few years in driving increased attach, given that's of relatively high significance to your strategy over the past several years?
Dion Weisler: Yes, it's a great question. Thank you, Wamsi. And I think about the entire Four Box Model when I think about our supplies business and its stabilization. And so I'll comment a little bit on each of the levers. I mean, the Four Box Model continues to predict supplies revenue will stabilize in constant currency and adjusted for the change in the supplies sales model by the end of '17. It's also performed in line with or better than our expectations that we had at the beginning of each of the 4 prior quarters. And recall that we changed the supplies sales model due to the increased impact of the omnichannel environment and believe that this would be a more efficient model. And it's certainly proving to be a more efficient model, our execution of the demand-driven change has seen improved sell-out linearity. We're holding less weeks of stock in channel inventory, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, as Cathie mentioned. And we're achieving the cost savings that we previously had put towards discount dollars and that's supporting an increase in the marketing to drive the Print relevance. And that's really at the center of your question, the increase in the marketing dollars and the stable environment out there is enabling us to sell the value of original supplies. And as a result of that, that has an impact on that particular box. But we're making improvements in all 4 areas. The installed base continues to improve in terms of size and shape. Usage, we have a lot of focus on usage, obviously, in terms of our marketing spend. And also in the change of the different models that we have Managed Print Services and Instant Ink, of course, impact the box that you're talking about, the original supplies and we sell a Managed Print Service contract on Instant Ink. It comes with increased HP original supplies, and so we're happy about that and obviously, maintaining a uniform price environment is helpful. So I think on many dimensions, the results we're starting to see flow through the Printing business are as a result of the work that the team's been doing across all 4 boxes and the one that you mentioned is obviously a big part of that.
Catherine Lesjak: And maybe I'll throw another data point. So graphics continues to grow, both nominally and in constant currency. So the graphics growth in supplies specifically was kind of low to mid-single digits on the back of about a double-digit improvement in pages printed and impressions. And so that is -- that continues to be part of the strategy as well as we've talked about core growth in future in the growth category is graphics, and we're continuing to make good progress there.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays.
Mark Moskowitz: The first question is around the second half of the year. Just trying to understand why the guidance seems a little conservative, given the goodness this quarter and the trend line in Printing? Is there something else that you're being maybe careful with in terms of peaking market share momentum, maybe some channel dynamics that have you a little concerned, where you want to make sure the channel sell-through is better or other, I guess, would be the question?
Catherine Lesjak: So Mark, I don't think -- I think we're being prudent in our outlook. I don't think that we see anything specifically looming that is making us be more conservative than we have typically been. There are a lot of different things going on in the market, all of which are not easy to call. The uncertainty in the PC market around commodity pricing, commodity availability, the demand impact of raising prices, those are some of the things that kind of weigh on the market. And therefore, we're trying to take that into consideration, and we're also trying to take into consideration just the uncertainty that exists in the currency market. On a year-over-year basis, currency has not been too big of an impact on the top line, a little bit more on the bottom line. But understanding what the impact is going to be of kind of U.S. policies and even the full impact of Brexit, there's enough uncertainties out there that we think that it's prudent that our outlook is prudent.
Mark Moskowitz: Okay, fair enough. The follow-up question is around kind of Katy's question earlier in terms of as-a-service. Can you give us a sense in terms of how investors should think about that business vector being potentially material for both Printing and/or PCs? Is that a 2018 or is that more of a 2020 phenomenon?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think it's a longer-term phenomenon. I mean, we are making progress. For sure, we are seeing the move from transactional to contractual. But it is not at a rate that says it's going to be typically -- really material. And we'll talk more about this at the Security Analyst Meeting when we talk a little bit longer term. It's definitely a trend in the market. We think it's good for us over the long term, but it is not going to have a material impact in the short term.
Dion Weisler: The last data points I've seen on this, and it's going back a little way, not too far back, was there was a 6-point swing from transactional motions to contractual motions. Faster in mature markets than emerging markets. I would say that, again, like most of the areas where we focus on, we're out-executing the industry average on that. And as a result of that, our pipeline is growing steadily for Device-as-a-Service, Mobility-as-a-Service, obviously Managed Print Services, we're sort of 10 years into that journey already, it's quite mature for us. So I expect it is an ongoing customer trend. More and more customers want to have a contractual relationship. And when we provide them the capability to do that across their Personal Systems and Print platforms, it's always a different kind of conversation. So I expect it is a trend that will continue but, as Cathie mentions, it doesn't become absolutely material for some time in the future.
Catherine Lesjak: Managed Print Services revenue is going kind of low to mid-single digit. So the trend is there, but it's just not an exponential increase.
Operator: And our final question for today will come from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: So part of the [ bear ] thesis is that the Print market is in secular decline yet you've still been able to place high-NPV printers now pretty consistently. Is there a point where you think you won't be able to place any more of these printers and we start to see those profits flow down? Or has there been a change in the secular story in the broader Print market? And then I have a follow-up.
Dion Weisler: I would say that, generally speaking, the answer always lies much more deeply down in the segmentation, that you can't tackle the Print market with a single brush. Obviously, there were areas of clear secular decline in the Consumer market. And we said, we don't think it's likely. We said it back at SAM, we don't think it's likely that we could turn that market back into growth, but our job is to reduce the glide slope of descent. And I think with the new range of Consumer Printing devices we've bought to market, introducing brand-new categories like Sprocket, which is doing incredibly well, and attracting customers that have never printed before, many millennials that have had their photos trapped in their phone are now able to free them by having a Sprocket in their pocket. And that's goodness for the category, and obviously, we remain focused on the high-quality NPV units. We're getting a lot more big data, we're leveraging that big data to understand exactly where we're going to make those investments. And I think that segmentation and pockets of growth and opportunity of growth will continue in the market. And let's not forget, we are very new entrants into the A3 copier market. That's a $55 billion market, and we have less than 4% market share. So that is why we have a strategy that has a core element to it, the vast majority of our revenue and operating profit today, but a very clear growth element to it in terms of graphics and A3 and commercial mobility, and we see that playing out over the next 2 to 3 years. And then out into the future of with blended reality, immersive computing on the one hand and 3D Printing on the other provides us opportunity for long-term growth 3 years to 10 years-plus out.
Maynard Um: And if we look across your businesses, you should have an improving mix shift to higher-margin businesses. Some of the ones you mentioned in the past like the accessories, the displays, gaming, commercials, graphics, obviously we know the size of some of these. But are all of these -- the other businesses at a level of scale that can now help you to move the needle for you on margins? And how much runway do you think you have for growth in these businesses?
Dion Weisler: Well, I think if we take by way of example, the Personal Systems market, it's a $333 billion market but about half of that market is the non-core stuff that most of us think and talk about, Notebooks and Desktops and detachables and convertibles. The other half of the market is thin clients and services and accessories and displays, and in many of those markets we're underpenetrated. And in many of those markets, they come at higher margin. So as we index our way up into that part of the market, it's a very clear strategy of Ron and his team as we execute against our Personal Systems. And that helps offset the higher pressured areas of some parts of the core business and the same is true for Printing as we just highlighted.
Catherine Lesjak: And then the other thing that's going on in Personal Systems in kind of what we think of as the core business is there's a positive mix shift going on. And that is -- that leads to kind of units increasing or decreasing at a different rate than what revenue is. And we have been ahead of that positive mix shift. And so if you looked at IDCs kind of revenue growth for PCs in calendar Q1, it was up more than units. So units were up 0.8 points. They expect for the rest of the year that units will be down a bit but that revenue will be flat. And as I said, we are ahead of that trend and so we're benefiting and basically gaining rev share.
Dion Weisler: So thank you for the questions, and thank you all for taking the time to join us today. I'm -- continue to gain in confidence quarter after quarter as the team embraces change and turns that change into opportunity. I characterize the quarter as a breakthrough quarter for us, delivering growth in both segments, Printing and Personal Systems. Again, that's the first time since FY '10. We're taking profitable share, we're out executing our competitors and we're delivering some of the best innovation, I think, this company has ever seen. But we remain humbled by that. Every day we must continue to amaze customers with the most competitive, disruptive portfolio on the planet. And we're playing offense, and I think that's the right place for us to be. And I think our most innovative days and best days lie ahead of us. Thanks very much for joining us.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2017 Q1  (2017-02-22 17:01:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the First Quarter 2017 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon. I'm Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for this fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017, and HP's other SEC filings. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying I'm very pleased with our performance this quarter. As a more nimble company, we've been able to accelerate our strategy, and we're now firing on all cylinders. With the strong start to our 2017 fiscal year, we continue to build on our track record of delivering on all of our financial commitments with discipline, focus and execution. We've also made solid progress in positioning the business for long-term growth. And we accomplished this amidst a market backdrop that remained highly competitive. Let me take a moment to share the notable highlights for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38, at the high end of our outlook range. We exceeded free cash flow expectations, delivering more than $700 million and returning more than $600 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we grew net revenue by 4% year-over-year to $12.7 billion with double-digit growth in Personal Systems. We are delivering strong results because we are executing on our reinvention and driving our strategy to protect our core, prioritize growth and invest in the future. We are doing this with a relentless focus on innovation and engineering technologies that consistently amaze our partners and customers. A perfect demonstration of this is in Personal Systems, where, yet again for the third consecutive quarter, the team delivered exceptional results. This is a story of innovation and execution delivering revenue, margin expansion and market share growth year-over-year. Personal Systems' revenue grew 10% year-over-year with operating profit improvement. The last time we saw this level of revenue growth was in 2014 triggered by the XP refresh cycle. In contrast, this growth was triggered by HP's innovation engine and ability to outperform the market. I'm particularly pleased with the balanced results in Personal Systems across geographies and product segments. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all 3 regions as well as in notebooks and workstations. Our focus on segmenting the market opportunities and addressing strategic pockets of growth with differentiated products has resulted in profitable share gains in both Consumer and Commercial. In calendar quarter 4, we beat the PC market unit growth by 8.5 points, outperforming all key competitors and achieving our highest-ever worldwide market share position of 21.8%. Our focus is to bring customer value and innovation to market. And because of this, we have been rewarded with share gains. This is the way we like to win. Without a doubt, our momentum can be attributed to the strongest portfolio in our history. At the Consumer Electronics Show last month, once again, we took home nearly 2 dozen awards for products like the EliteBook x360, the world's thinnest business convertible notebook; and the ENVY Curved All-in-One desktop, the world's most immersive at 34 inches. And one key point of differentiation is security. We work very hard to ensure that HP's PCs and printers are the world's most secure and manageable. Last week, at RSA, we announced HP Sure Click, the world's only integrated browsing solution that protects HP devices from the #1 attack vector, which is malware. This supplements our best-in-class security stack and is part of our HP secure promise to customers. If you ask Ron Coughlin, HP's President of Personal Systems about the magic within the business, he would tell you that we are continuously changing the way we create and deliver computing experiences that amaze. It is based on a unique understanding of the market and direct collaboration with our customers and partners. Several large wins this quarter resulted from these deep partnerships: Corning, a leading innovator in material sciences; and Roche, one of the largest biotech companies in the world, both depend on HP to deliver a comprehensive package for everything from desktops to workstations to notebooks. Now turning to Printing. We made great progress in stabilizing the business. Hardware revenue grew year-over-year in constant currency with units up 6%, bolstered by our new Sprocket product that is helping create a new category in mobile printing. The overall market was a bit better than expected with slight unit growth year-over-year in calendar quarter 4. Due to our hard work taking cost out, we were well positioned to take advantage of this market upside and place more positive NPV units. Our installed base mix quality continued to improve, supported by share gains in value, multi-function printers for the 19th consecutive quarter. We continued to deliver highly secure and innovative printing solutions for our customers and partners and had several significant wins, including one of our biggest ever with one of the world's largest providers of technology solutions for the automotive industry, and they are leveraging HP products, including the world's most secure LaserJet hardware, care packs and supplies. We also saw momentum in strategic contractual areas with strong results in Managed Print Services and continued good momentum in Instant Ink enrollment. You'll recall one of our key growth initiatives in Printing is graphics, which delivered strong performance once again with year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency for the 14th consecutive quarter. We saw strong hardware growth in Indigo, large-format industrial and PageWide XL as well as growth in graphic supplies and services. Among the many strong custom deployments is LSC Communications, a global leader in print services, who is deploying our PageWide Web Press to support its growing client demand, having more than 3 billion pages of capacity in its printing platform. With our continued progress this quarter, we remain confident that supplies revenue, in constant currency, will stabilize by the end of fiscal 2017. Consistent with that, total supplies revenue was down just 2% year-over-year in constant currency. As we always say, it's all about supplies, and we continue to drive a number of initiatives within the Four Box Model to return this revenue stream to growth. Also in Printing, we're on track with the acquisition of Samsung's printing business that will help to accelerate our A3 portfolio. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. Turning to 3D Printing. This was a milestone quarter with our first unit shipments and revenue recognition. Customers such as Jabil, Materialise and Shapeways have received installations, and we are tracking to our strategy to disrupt the $12 trillion traditional manufacturing market. According to Jabil, Multi Jet Fusion is one of the few technologies capable of delivering production-grade parts with cost-effective efficiency. And according to them, some of their own end customers have said they couldn't believe 3D Printing could produce that kind of quality. Overall, quarter 1 was a quarter of innovation and solid execution. I'm proud of the results we were able to deliver, but we're never satisfied. We see plenty of momentum, innovation and opportunity for us to capture in both the near and long term and are aggressively pursuing profitable share and targeting strategic growth segments. We're continuing to accelerate and deliver for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders, and I remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments going forward. Again, fantastic quarter across all of our business segments. And now I'll turn the call over to Cathie to provide more details and our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Overall, I'm also very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered net revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported and up 5% in constant currency. We saw strong momentum globally with each region delivering top line growth year-over-year. Gross margin of 17.7% was down 1 point year-over-year, driven by unfavorable segment mix and commodity costs in Personal Systems. Sequentially, gross margin was down 0.6 points as Personal Systems rate was pressured with incremental cost of components, which was only partially offset by supplies mix in Printing. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 2% year-over-year with savings in SG&A more than offsetting an increase in R&D as we continued to invest in innovation and drive productivity improvement. With a net expense of $90 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 20.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.38. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, restructuring and other charges of $63 million and acquisition-related charges of $16 million, partially offset by non-operating retirement-related credits of $32 million and tax indemnification credits of $9 million. In Q1, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.36. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems performance was strong across all dimensions, achieving 10% revenue growth year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We saw momentum across both customer segments with Consumer and Commercial year-over-year revenue growth of 15% and 7%, respectively. While share performance is not our first priority, our disciplined focus on market segmentation and innovation enabled meaningful year-over-year share gains in calendar Q4 across Consumer and Commercial, notebook and desktops in every region. PC average selling prices were up both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by favorable product pricing rate and mix shift to premium. Gross profit was down both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by component costs and currency headwinds, which weren't fully mitigated by the higher average selling prices. However, with tight cost management and a reduction in non-revenue generating expenses, the team delivered a solid 3.8% operating profit, up 0.7 points year-over-year. Beyond the core, we made further progress on our growth strategy in Commercial mobility with strong double-digit revenue growth in detachables. Margin-rich Commercial services revenue grew double digits with improved penetration rate, and we continue to increase customer awareness on Device as a Service. Turning to Printing. We remain on track to deliver operational improvements in the core business while making progress on our growth initiatives. Print revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported or down just 2% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 6% year-over-year, a demonstration of the continued improvement in our cost structure, enabling us to place incremental positive NPV units. In calendar Q4, we gained 3.2 points of share in laser and 0.2 points of share in Inkjet hardware year-over-year. Outside of the traditional printer markets, we were very pleased to see the incredible interest in our new handheld photo printer, the HP Sprocket, which contributed about 1.6 points of unit growth to the year-over-year metric. The world's smallest printer has become a must-have accessory for mobile and social media printing. Print hardware average selling prices were down mid-single digits year-over-year, primarily due to rate and to a lesser extent, mix. With our improved cost structure, we can be more competitive in A4 laser pricing, and more low-end units can be sold with a positive NPV. As we've stated many times, we will continue to drive positive NPV unit placements as this is one of the many levers to drive ongoing supplies growth. In our growth initiatives, Managed Print Services revenue grew faster than the market once again, and new TCV was up year-over-year. Graphics also had balanced revenue growth across all regions with strong performance in Indigo and growth in supplies year-over-year. In Q1, total supplies revenue was down just 2% in constant currency. The year-over-year decline associated with the Four Box Model drivers was better than we expected, and as Dion said, we remain on track to stabilize supplies revenue in constant currency by the end of the year. Supplies revenue mix was 67%, up slightly year-over-year, driven by graphics, and channel inventory levels were healthy, below the top end of the new reduced and tightened target range. Operating profit for Printing was 16%, down 1 point year-over-year, driven by unfavorable rate due to currency and increased marketing spend for demand generation primarily to support supplies programs. These factors were only partially offset by operational and cost structure improvements. Now turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $767 million, and free cash flow was $735 million. Free cash flow was better than we expected due to the very strong performance of Personal Systems and the material improvement in linearity in the quarter. Supplies sales linearity also improved, some of which we attribute to the operational changes we implemented to our sales model in the second half of fiscal '16. Given our confidence that we've made these real structural improvements, we believe our free cash flow could be at the higher end of our $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion free cash flow outlook for the year. The cash conversion cycle was a record negative 30 days, a 1-day improvement sequentially, better than normal seasonality with a 5-day decrease in day sales outstanding partially offset by a 4-day decrease in accounts payable. During the quarter, we had a total capital return of $613 million through share repurchases and cash dividends, which was 83% of free cash flow as compared to our full year target of 50% to 75%. So we are well on track to deliver on this commitment. Looking ahead, keep the following in mind related to our financial outlook. In Personal Systems, we have increased pricing globally in response to unfavorable currency movements and the increased cost of components, which could have a more significant impact on demand than we've assumed. We expect Personal Systems revenue to be down more than normal sequential seasonality given the very strong performance in Q1, including the holiday season in the U.S. For Printing, in Q2, we expect improved supplies revenue performance year-over-year as compared to Q1, and we expect to continue to place positive NPV units. For the full year, we are on track to deliver our productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. Lastly, we have accelerated some of the Samsung integration charges from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2017, which will slightly reduce the full year GAAP EPS outlook but to the benefit of fiscal 2018 GAAP EPS. With all that in mind, Q2 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q2 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.32 to $0.35. Our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.42 to $1.52. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will be from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, question on free cash flow. You're starting the year up, $900 million year-on-year, so I'm struggling to understand why you'd end up, even at the high end of the range, down versus last year. Were there any onetime items this quarter? Or are there any headwinds that you see hitting as you move through the year?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Katy, thanks for the question. So we're really pleased with the Q1 cash flow, and it really came on the back of 2 things. One was the incredible strength in Personal Systems, where we saw sequential growth, which is atypical for Q4 to Q1 where we typically would see a decline, but we also saw much better linearity in the quarter, much more linear. And so that helped basically bring in revenue earlier, and therefore, we could collect it. So some of that is timing, but it's not all timing. So the supplies sales model change that we made in the second half last year, one of the benefits we expected to see was more linear sell-out, which means there's more linear sell-in. And we think that, that is, in fact, structural. And therefore, the uptick that we saw in Q1 as a result of that will stick to our fingers in the year, and that's why we have confidence in the -- going to the higher end of our outlook of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Specifically now though looking at Q2, what we see is that given the incredible strength in Personal Systems, especially around Black Friday and the holiday season, is that we think we'll have a much lower -- sorry, much higher sequential decline than what we typically see. That, combined with the fact that print typically would go up sequentially, is going to be a bit of a headwind on Q2 free cash flow. But for the year, good confidence that we could be at the higher end of our outlook range.
Kathryn Huberty: And then just as a follow-up, the supplies declined 2% constant currency. As you said, that was better than you expected. And you arguably had a difficult compare because of the inventory build in the year prior. So as comps ease, why wouldn't you get to that stabilizing supplies growth earlier than the fiscal fourth quarter?
Dion Weisler: Yes, thanks, Katy. Let me tackle it. Listen, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we remain confident that supplies revenue growth in constant currency will stabilize by the end of 2017 consistent with our Four Box Model analytics that we see. Actual performance continues to meet and at sometimes beat the Four Box Model forecast, which means that we firmly believe that the strategy that we're executing to is the right strategy and that you've seen those metrics play out inside the business results. So it gives us increased confidence as we head towards the end of '17 that we will stabilize in constant currency, and that's what we said we would do.
Catherine Lesjak: And Katy, that's really what the -- kind of the Four Box Model...
Dion Weisler: Had predicted.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, had predicted and is predicting for the rest of the year. And so that's really the basis on which we feel confident that we will get there by the end of the year, and we feel good about the performance in Q1.
Operator: The next question will be from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit on Printing operating margin dynamics. Operating margins for the Printing segment were at 16%, and arguably, you had a more favorable mix than you had envisioned. I think you had forecast that supplies would be down mid-single digits. They were only down 2% at constant currency. So I'm just wondering, was there anything -- and if I look at hardware unit growth, it was good year-over-year, but that was a really easy comp. Sequentially, it was actually the lowest in the last 7 years in terms of hardware revenue on a sequential basis. So my question is, is the 16%, which I think is a decline from what we saw in Q3 and Q4 on an adjusted normalized basis -- what drove that 16%? And is that sort of the right normalized level to think about? Or what dynamics impacted that?
Catherine Lesjak: So let's first talk about the 16% in Q1, and then we can talk a little bit about what we expect for the rest of the year. So specifically around the 16%, which was a 1 point decline on a year-over-year basis, was really a combination of unfavorable currency and the hardware mix that we had combined with the fact that we are investing in go to market. The biggest piece of that go-to-market investment is in marketing. So what we told you we would do as a result of the change in the sales model for supplies is that we were going to take the contra that we were going to save or the discounts that we were going to save in the top line, the net off of revenue, and we were going to reinvest it into marketing demand gen to drive print relevancy and usage. And that's what we're doing. And so that's -- those are the things that put pressure on it. Now what's offsetting that is that we are continuing to make -- have savings from productivity, but those were a bit higher than the productivity savings that we saw in Q1. In terms of kind of the rest of the year and how to think about it, what I said on the Q4 earnings call is still true on the Q1 earnings call, and that's that we don't target a particular rate for print from an operating profit perspective, but we do expect that in '17 that it'll be in kind of that mid-teens, kind of 16% to 18%. And the variability in that range is largely going to be driven by units that we place. And we're -- we've got a cost structure now that we think is quite competitive and allows -- has allowed us to open up some TAM for more positive NPV units, and when they're available, we want to go ahead and take advantage of them. And so that's what we did this quarter, and we look forward to doing that the rest of the year as well.
Dion Weisler: The market was a little higher than the analysts had predicted, and we took advantage of that with that lower cost structure that Cathie is talking about. And then you're seeing that show up in the units at positive 6% versus last year and negative 16%. There's like a 22 point spread there.
Catherine Lesjak: And the market was better in the kind of Deskjet lower -- kind of Consumer space. And so while they were still NPV positive and therefore of interest to us, they were at the lower end.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, please. Can you just comment on channel inventory both for PCs and for Printing on a sequential basis? Did you have any change in inventory in either of those businesses in the channel inventory?
Catherine Lesjak: So in both -- for print -- let me start with PC, sorry. For PC channel inventory, we did have some channel inventory reductions sequentially. On the print side, in total, we were down a bit. In supplies, we were obviously down materially year-over-year as a result of the change in the sales model, and we were also down a bit sequentially.
Operator: The next question will be from Kulbinder Garcha of CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: Just a couple of questions. Maybe for Dion first. When I look at the actual numbers, revenues grew for the first time across the company, 4% year-on-year. You beat estimates by around $800 million, $900 million on the top line. There wasn't as much of a bottom line flow through in operating income. In fact, it was down like-for-like year-on-year. Was this a quarter just across the company a very high level of investment? I hear what Cathie said about the NPV units you took advantage of. But whether it's on 3D Printing or whether it's on other things you are doing on the PC side or channel initiatives, did you reinvest or invest relatively heavily, would you say, this quarter, and why we didn't see that leverage? My second question is just on supplies. You're still talking about stability by year-end. But given the units you're now placing, once we move beyond the end of the year compared to, let's say, 3 or 6 months ago, what's your confidence that into the following year we might see a year in which supplies actually starts growing?
Dion Weisler: Okay. I'll start and then I'm sure Cathie will, no doubt, chime in here. I think Cathie answered the question on print pretty substantially, so I'm not sure there's much additional information to add there. We obviously invested in marketing. We invested in units, and there was some currency. We also had currency in Personal Systems. But we also faced some fairly competitive or increased prices for components, and that was a headwind to the quarter, which we overcame by effectively growing out of the problem because our cost structure was much more in line with where we needed to be from a competitive situation. The innovation portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, more than 23 awards that we won at CES. We were leaning into that innovation from a customer's perspective but a lot of demand for our products. So even against that cost headwind from a component-level perspective, we were able to substantially improve our performance from a top line perspective. And you saw, obviously, Personal Systems up 10% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency.
Catherine Lesjak: And Kulbinder, in terms of kind of a longer-term view of supplies, we haven't really provided an outlook out beyond '17. But what I will say, as we have now a very substantial kind of evidence point of down just 2% in constant currency for supplies year-over-year in Q1 -- I'm sorry -- yes, in Q1, we are on that march to get it stabilized in constant currency by the end of the year. And then, of course, we are at the same time focusing on making sure that we're placing the right units, the positive NPV units and making the right investments across A3 and graphics as well as 3D for longer term so that, over time, we will drive supplies back to growth.
Operator: The next question will be from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Cathie, you talked about currency hurting the printer margin, but I would have thought the weak yen would have really been a help in terms of Canon's supply from you, and then maybe there would be an offset at revenue in terms of competition. And then second on Printing, I also was curious. There seem to be about a $1 billion reclassification from Commercial to Consumer hardware. Can you explain what that was about?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So on the yen, the contract that we have with Canon does not adjust every day. It has a certain band around it, and as a result, we, in fact, have not seen a benefit from the weakening yen in our cost of sales yet. So it was still an overall headwind for print. And currency was an overall headwind for print both on the top line because of the strength of the dollar as well as on cost of sales because we haven't seen that snap back yet. In terms of the reclass, at the beginning of November, Enrique reorganized his business, and he basically now has a more aligned along Consumer -- I'm sorry, Consumer -- I'm sorry, not Consumer -- business lines, customer segments. So he's got a Consumer or a home division. He's got an office division, and he's got basically graphics. And then we just realigned the units and all of the revenue to line up with that new customer segment view. So what ended up happening is the personal lasers moved from the Commercial category to the home/small, medium business category. And that's the adjustment that you see. Everything's been adjusted so that you can get a good apples-to-apples view. It doesn't totally change anything at the segment level or the HP Co. level for revenue or profit.
Dion Weisler: And that makes all sorts of sense from our perspective because we're trying to look always through the lens of a customer. And a customer-centric approach means that we try to develop technologies that make sense for a customer, whether they happen to be laser or ink-based or whatever else we have in our kit bag as opposed to being driven by technology lines. And that's why we made that alignment change.
Operator: The next question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: The first one, Dion, can you talk a bit more about the PC market? I mean, you talked about strength in PCs that you guys saw but also noted outperforming the market pretty substantially. So I'm just curious how you see -- how sustainable you see the growth in PCs. You know, you've got Windows 10, aging installed base, stability of processors. But what are you sort of seeing out there? And I'm curious as to whether or not you're also feeling a pickup in business following the election or what you're -- what you think is sort of behind some of the growth you're seeing? And then I have a follow-up.
Dion Weisler: Great. I think it's always helpful to answer this question in 2 parts. There's the short-term view of the market, and I'll get Cathie to tackle that. And then I'll give you a long-term view of how we see the PC market, and then we'll sort of close out with the rest of your question.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Shannon. So yes, we've definitely seen the PC market improve. And in addition to kind of a unit view, we're also seeing a positive mix shift. So while units were down year-on-year in calendar Q4, 1.7%, the IDC PC category revenue was actually up 2%. And what we're -- we're really kind of leaning in to that mix shift. We've seen it through kind of premium, gaming, convertibles, detachables, even the notebooks being kind of thinner, lighter, better battery life as well as the discontinuation of the Windows 10 kind of free upgrade. Those are all the things that are helping the market but also things that we are taking advantage of. If you look out for '17, our view is pretty consistent with IDC that units will be down kind of low to mid-single digits but that revenue for the market will again still have this mix shift benefit and will be flat. But one of the things to keep in mind also in '17 is that there's a fair amount of uncertainty in the PC ecosystem when you think about kind of commodity availability as well as commodity pricing. And as a result of that, we've taken pricing and a lot of our competition has taken pricing as well, and we've got to really kind of see how that impacts demand. We've obviously modeled what we think the impact would be, but we'll have to see whether or not in fact the demand impact is lesser or greater than what we've already modeled into our outlook.
Dion Weisler: And more broadly speaking, if I helicopter up a little bit, I don't think our views have fundamentally changed on this business. It's still a very large business. I always like to remind everyone it's a $333 billion market. It's very competitive, and it continues to consolidate. So when we take share faster than our competitors 3 quarters in a row and we're executing the way we're executing but not taking share for share's sake, which we're committed to not doing, what we end up with is a business that's firing on all cylinders. More broadly, we think it's all about innovation, and as I mentioned in my initial remarks, the growth that we saw in the PC business wasn't as a result of one kind of event. It's wasn't like an XP refresh cycle. It was off the back of really strong innovation right across the portfolio, the values that the customer sees and the little sprinkles of magic that Ron and the team are adding to the product portfolio. We have to be excellent in the core. We have to continue to search for those pockets of growth as we segment the market, like commercial mobility, create categories like Sprout and x3. All of it has to be anchored in megatrends that we see changing in the market. Services and solutions make a big part of that $333 billion market. About half the market is not the core of what you think about as desktops and notebooks. It's a lot of services and solutions and attach and other devices and workstations and thin clients. There's megatrends around Consumer and Commercial, this one life, millennials, mobility and security. So doing that segmentation, operating, continuing to take cost out of the system means that we're playing our own game and we're being rewarded for it.
Shannon Cross: And then can you talk a bit about your copier strategy. I know it's about to launch. I'm just curious, as you've gone through and you're working through the Samsung transaction and talking to potential channel partners, if you can talk about the reception and what you're hearing.
Dion Weisler: Look, the reception has been broadly positive on a number of dimensions, firstly, off the back of our own home-grown innovation with the PageWide Array and the abilities to take that into the A3 line of products. But in addition to that, obviously, the line that we're initially OEM-ing from Samsung but then once we complete the Samsung acquisition by the end of this year, we'll round out the portfolio. So I think across the globe, a lot of very detailed plans at a partner level down at the customer level. I spend personal time all around the world working with the teams on the go-to-market strategy, which is every bit as important as having a fantastic product portfolio. And then we marry that together with the marketing work that Antonio and his team are driving, some terrific new marketing campaigns anchored around security, which is really resonating with our Customer Advisory Council and other customers and partners. You put all that together, we're really looking forward to the launch of these products, which, as you mentioned, is coming up pretty quickly here.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citi.
Jim Suva: Thus far, a lot of the questions have been on the Printing side, which makes sense given the profitability there. So I guess I'll ask a question on the PCs. You mentioned that you increased pricing. Just curious, was that due mostly to FX? Or is it also are you seeing component price increasing? And if so, is the addition of the ASPs enough to offset component pricing? Or should we just be mindful of that as I believe some of the component costs, especially storage, have been recently increasing? So just kind of thinking about the profitability of that.
Catherine Lesjak: So Jim, consistent with our expectations, both the commodity supply environment but also pricing tightened up in Q1. And that was absolutely a headwind to Personal Systems OP that we were able to jump over with some pricing but also with incredible tight management from an expense perspective and reducing non-revenue generating costs. We expect that into Q2 this is going to continue, and in some categories, we do expect that the price will continue to increase. And so this continues to be a headwind for us. But if I kind of take it all the way up to the top level, as Dion talked about, it's really all about making sure you got a great cost structure, the leanest you can have and then innovate -- understanding your markets really well and innovating into those markets. And I think that Ron and his team have really proven this quarter, if not, the previous few quarters that they know how to execute and they know how to execute in tough environments. And we should -- would definitely say this is a tougher commodity environment for us.
Operator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.
Wamsi Mohan: So 2 questions. One, the Printing supplies revenues were down 2%, was somewhat better than expected relative to your comments, I think, last quarter, mid-single-digit decline based on the Four Box Model. Can you address what drove the upside in the quarter in that context of the Four Box Model specifically? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't break it down in that much detail, but I would reiterate the fact that the -- we did better than what the Four Box Model was suggesting. And certainly, we will continue to drive all of the different initiatives that we've got going against each of the boxes because it is -- it continues to be true and our fundamental belief it'll continue to be so that those are the key levers that are going to drive supplies revenue, both to stabilization in constant currency by the end of the year and then ultimately to growth beyond that.
Wamsi Mohan: As my follow-up, can you address like specifically within the tighter component environment, like how much longer do you think, a, that'll persist? And how are you addressing that including any large strategic buys maybe that you did within the quarter or that you're looking to do and leverage your balance sheet to do that?
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, when we think about Personal Systems commodities, it is really 3 commodities that are under pressure. It's memory, which includes random access memory as well as STD. In addition to that, there's batteries and LCDs. And we take a very long-term approach with our supplier base. We have long-term agreements with many of them. We do seek to leverage the balance sheet wherever it makes sense economically for us to do that. How long will this last? It's a little bit difficult to completely forecast that, but I would say from previous experience, it takes a long time to change factory output levels. And for example, what's affecting memory at the moment is the doubling in density across most of the mobile phone market as well as the mobile phones are selling many more in absolute units, but the fact that they all doubled their density puts pressure on that memory market. So if you want to really adjust that, what you have to do is add capacity, and we're talking about billions of dollars of investments from the memory manufacturers. That doesn't happen overnight. So these cycles can often last quite some time, and it varies by commodity. But that should be the way you should be thinking about it.
Catherine Lesjak: And then to the specific question about leveraging -- using our balance sheet, we are absolutely using our balance sheet. We talked about it, I believe it was on the Q3 earnings call, about the fact that we were anticipating this. And therefore in Q4, we were going to build some strategic inventory, and we have continued to do that. In fact, if you look at our working capital -- the elements of our working capital, days of inventory is basically higher than it otherwise would be because of the strategic buys that we're doing. We have that capability, and we think it's a competitive advantage.
Operator: The next question will be from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: On your cash return, you returned almost 1/4 of the high end of your annual free cash flow guide in the fourth quarter. So it looks like it -- this might put you ahead of the 50% to 75% of the free cash flow return target. Should we expect a deceleration in share repurchases? Or do you think you can return greater than that 50% to 75%? And I guess, any commentary if -- around your expectation for cash repatriation holiday, if that's supporting any confidence there. And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So maybe I'll start with the second one on kind of our view on tax -- or cash repatriation from overseas and a tax holiday. At this point, that is unknown what exactly is going to happen. And so that's really not playing into what we're doing at all at this point in time. We're still committed to returning 50% to 75%. And what we said in FY '17 is that we would be at the higher end of that, and that continues to be our commitment.
Maynard Um: Okay. And then can you just talk about the Samsung acquisition charges, I guess, more specifically why they're being brought in? And maybe just talk about what specifically they are.
Catherine Lesjak: So the Samsung integration expenses kind of run the gamut from kind of transaction costs, legal costs and then very specifically around integration. And whenever you put this together, it's always a little bit difficult to know exactly what the timing's going to be. In total, we still expect that the Samsung integration costs are going to be in the $150 million to $200 million range and that we will take those on a GAAP-only basis and basically call them out each quarter. So I don't think there's anything particularly special about the fact that the timing's changed a bit, just a better assessment of when the costs are going to be incurred.
Operator: The next question will be from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: Cathie, I think you said that the Personal Systems Group should be down more than typical. When I think about that segment, I think about it being down about 10% sequentially in 2Q for you. Is that sort of the right way to think about what the normal is? And maybe it'll be a little bit lower than that. And also, do you expect to see some growth in that segment in the second quarter?
Catherine Lesjak: So Sherri, what is typical for us in terms of normal seasonality for Personal Systems is probably closer to 6%, not your 10%. But we do expect to be worse than that as a result of the strength that we saw in Q1. And as you know, we don't guide revenue and certainly don't guide revenue at the segment level. But we have the right cost structure. We are innovating and bringing to market great value propositions for our customers. And so we will continue to fight the good fight with our competition, and we'll see how we work out -- how it works out in Q2.
Sherri Scribner: Great. Super. And then just the supplies model change that you made, we're roughly 3 quarters into that now. How do you feel about that change? Is it working? I assume you're going to say that it is working but maybe some more detail in retrospect about how that's working out for you.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Sherri, I'm very pleased with how it's working out. We basically believe that by getting to closer to global pricing consistency that there would be a number of benefits. One was going to be just much more linear supplies performance. As I've said, we've had linear sales out that then therefore, we would have more linear sales in. And we're absolutely seeing that. And as I said, that's what gives us some confidence that we will get some permanent linearity benefit this year. But it is also great from a partner perspective because, of course, they're carrying lower channel inventory, and therefore, that's their working capital. Our channel inventory levels are healthy. They are below the top end of the newly lowered and narrowed ranges, so we're feeling good about that as well. And then we're also seeing in the quarter improvement in terms of discounting. And as I mentioned, we're taking that in lower discounts and basically -- and reinvesting them back into marketing to drive print relevancy and usage. And it's very important that we do that because we do not want to be selling supplies on promo. We want to drive the value to help our customers understand the value of using HP-branded ink and toner, and marketing's going to be important to that.
Dion Weisler: Again, looking through the eyes of a customer, it increases customer satisfaction when there's not enormous price volatility in the market, that encourages gray imports and all of the issues associated with that and the frustrations associated with that. So we've seen the gray marketing activity significantly reduced. We're seeing much more stable prices in the market, which is a benefit for customers, channel partners and our business performance.
Operator: The next question will be from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I just wanted to come back to this question of printing margins. I think one of the questions a lot of people leave the call with is the fact you delivered 16% margins here. And Cathie, you're saying it ranges 16% to 18%, but I guess people are going to continue to wonder whether the new normal is 16% or whether we should get back up into the middle of that range you're talking about. And I wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on what was abnormal about this quarter or things about this quarter that won't manifest themselves in future quarters and will let those margins expand back toward the middle of your range. And I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So Rod, I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder. I love 16%. I love 16% when we put units out, positive NPV units out there, and we grow units 6%. And if that was the opportunity that existed throughout the rest of the year, I'd be okay with it. And I would hope that you'd be okay with it because it's going to drive great supplies connect over the long term. Now I think that we probably will get higher in the range, but honestly, if there are opportunities to place more NPV-positive units, we should do that all day long.
Rod Hall: Okay. So just to clarify that, your -- the margin would tend toward the low end of the range only because of unit placement. There's nothing else going on in those margins.
Catherine Lesjak: I mean, we've got currency impacts. You've got productivity savings. There's lots of things that are going on in the margins, but the biggest driver for us to be at the lower end of that range is going to be placing positive NPV units.
Rod Hall: Okay. And then my follow-up was just on Printing supplies growth. It looks to me with these numbers that you may actually be growing revenues on a year-over-year basis for this full year. Is that a possibility? Do you think that's a likelihood in your plan?
Dion Weisler: We're confident in stabilizing supplies by the end of '17.
Catherine Lesjak: In constant currency.
Operator: And the last question will be from Aaron Rakers of Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: First question is on -- you've talked a lot about the alignment of your cost structure, and I'm curious if you can give us an update of where you stand on the incremental headcount reduction that you had announced at the Analyst Day. I think it was 3,000 to 4,000 headcount and how we should think about the rate of reinvestments relative to the $1 billion of incremental savings you were expected to generate through the exit of fiscal 2018. And what I'm really trying to get at is how do we think about the operating margin and the drivers of trending it towards the higher end of your 8% to 10% range that you laid out.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Well, let's talk first about kind of the restructuring. In Q1, we had roughly 350 employees leave under the plan, and as you said, for the year, our target is 1,500 to 2,500. And again, we gave that range because we were assessing different outsourcing opportunities, and there's still a bit of a range based on that. I would say we're on track from a restructuring perspective. Restructuring is just a part of the overall $1 billion in productivity savings that we're targeting for the year. And that is -- it comes over the course of the year and is a little bit back-end loaded. But we're feeling confident that we will be delivering on those productivity savings as well.
Aaron Rakers: And relative to that 8% to 10% operating margin long-term target model, I don't think The Street is really fully reflective of anything close to the higher end of that range. I'm just -- is that purely a function of product mix beyond that? Or how do we think about that higher end of that long-term model range?
Catherine Lesjak: So first, the 8% to 10% is really a long-term kind of operating margin view, and it -- we have always said that we'd be at the lower end of that range if there were good opportunities to place positive NPV units. So there's kind of a theme here. It really makes a difference because of the upfront investment that you need to make on units. Certainly, to get in that range, we also need to get supplies in more in a growth mode.
Dion Weisler: And in addition to that, it would be the full execution of our strategy not only in the core but as well as the growth. There's A3. Think about that $55 billion market where we have less than 4% market share today, continuing our ramp of graphics and Commercial mobility. And we've only just begun on 3D Printing where we placed those first units and revenue rec-ed them, which is even more exciting. And the fact that our customers are telling us that the printers are performing as per our promise on speed, quality and cost is really important. And that strategy is anchored in time horizons. The core is the here and now. Growth is the next 2 to 3 years, and future is sort of 3- to 10-year time frame. And that's how we think about this business. I thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to tune in today. I think this quarter can best be characterized as relentless execution and innovation that delivered really strong results. It's a consecutive quarter of growth, so this is the second quarter in a row of growth and solid performance. Innovation is at the heart of driving the meaningful share gains that we had. We're the pillar of stability right now in the industry, whether it's on the security dimension or innovation dimension regardless of the market conditions. We have increased confidence in our ability to deliver on the commitments that we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting. And I remain convinced as does the rest of our entire organization that our most innovative days lie ahead of us. Thanks very much.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks a lot.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q4  (2016-11-22 17:30:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2016 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon. I'm Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to announce another quarter of solid progress in both innovation and execution. As we wrap up our first fiscal year as HP Inc., we continue to deliver on our financial commitments, and I'm proud of the progress we are making in our core growth and future framework. In quarter 4, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, within our outlook range. And we achieved net revenue growth nominally and in constant currency. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.60, within the original outlook range provided at the start of the year. We exceeded expectations for free cash flow, delivering $2.8 billion, and returned over $2 billion to shareholders, at the high end of our 50% to 75% target range. This time last year, we faced industry-wide headwinds and difficult market conditions. But as I said to you then, we believe change equals opportunity and that we would reinvent ourselves and our business to drive long-term success. We accelerated restructuring activities and adjusted our tactics to deliver on our commitments with operational discipline. What's notable is we did this while maintaining key investments in innovation to help us drive long-term profitable growth. And what you have seen during the course of the year are perhaps the most competitive and disruptive products ever. While the road ahead will continue to be challenged, we exited fiscal '16 with momentum and confidence in our ability to execute. Before we provide our view on Q1 of '17, I want to spend a few minutes on some of this quarter's highlights and achievements in Personal Systems, Printing and 3D Printing. Personal Systems delivered the trifecta once again with year-over-year and sequential revenue growth, market share gains and increased operating profit. Coming into the quarter, we anticipated component shortages and took actions that positioned us well to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. We have a robust innovation engine producing an incredibly strong portfolio across Consumer, Commercial, Notebooks, Desktops, Workstations and Services. Each delivered top line growth despite an overall tough and competitive market. Through discipline and focus, we achieved share gains across all 3 regions, yielding a record high position of 21.4% market share worldwide. We are outperforming both the market as a whole and the competition. In line with our core strategy, we focused on highly segmented, profitable opportunities where we chose to play. We continued momentum in the Consumer Premium and Gaming segments, enabling us to beat Consumer Notebook market growth by more than 10 points. In Commercial, we achieved another record high share position of 24.8%, with accelerated growth in higher-margin offerings, including CapEx and other Commercial services. We continue to play our own game in Personal Systems and are seeing traction as we deliver differentiated experiences that amaze. One of the product highlights for the quarter was the delivery of our high-end OMEN X gaming platform for those who crave a truly immersive experience. We also introduced the world's first notebook with an integrated privacy screen to combat visual hacking and extend our leadership in security. We also launched the Pavilion Wave and Elite Slice PCs. These systems combine engineering excellence and truly inventive desktop design. We are setting the standard for highly innovative and beautiful devices, taking profitable market share and forcing our competitors to raise their bar if they want to compete for the hearts and minds of premium customers. Shifting to Printing. For the first time in several quarters, print hardware revenue grew year-over-year, with units up 1% as compared to declines of 20% in quarter 1, 16% in quarter 2 and 10% in quarter 3. In addition, we improved ASPs both year-over-year and sequentially. Towards the end of quarter 4, we saw some pockets of improved competitive dynamics that we associate with the strength of the yen. We will continue to be disciplined in our hardware unit pricing, with a focus on shifting the sales mix towards units that deliver higher value over their lifetime. In quarter 4, we continued to execute the supplies sales model change that we announced in quarter 3, which is helping us to achieve more consistent global pricing. As a result of these actions, we exited the second half with a significant reduction in supplies channel inventory, in line with our outlook. We are now well positioned as we enter fiscal 2017 and will continue to increase marketing spend to drive HP regional supplies brand awareness and end-user demand. We remain confident that shifting to a replenishment channel fulfillment model is a much more efficient way to run our global go-to-market strategy for supplies in the new omnichannel reality. While we continued to work on improvements in the core print business, we also achieved progress in our growth initiatives. Graphics delivered a record revenue quarter coming off a successful drupa show, with constant currency growth for the 13th consecutive quarter. In fact, in quarter 4 we delivered more than 300 HP Indigo digital presses following our robust order pipeline. Companies like Shutterfly and Cimpress are now taking full advantage of the benefits of digital over analog as well as the quality and productivity breakthroughs enabled by our presses to address peak holiday season demand. Managed Print Services had another excellent quarter with double-digit new total contract value growth. This is an area where we significantly outperform the market. And similarly, I'm pleased with the adoption of Instant Ink, our consumer subscription service which continued to increase with a record quarter of new enrollees. Earlier this quarter, at our annual Global Partner Conference, we announced our acquisition of Samsung's printer business, which will help us accelerate the disruption of the $55 billion A3 copier segment. We expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2017. In parallel to our announcement, we launched a breakthrough portfolio of A3 multifunction printers and services which will begin to ship in the second quarter. These announcements are symbolic of delivering on the growth portion of our strategy and highlight our commitment to disrupt markets where we can grow profitably. In support of our more than 250,000 channel partners, we also introduced partner-first program updates that we expect will radically simplify and enhance partner engagement. And in line with the market shift to contractual sales, we introduced Device as a Service partner specialization to drive a services-led sales transformation. As part of our channel strategy and partner-centric approach, we were honored recently by Canalys who named HP #1 in EMEA channel satisfaction. This is the first time a large company has ever been #1. This is unprecedented and tells me we're on the right track in investing in our partners to help grow our mutual businesses. In support of our future strategy in 3D Printing, Materialise, a leader in additive manufacturing and 3D printing, is adding HP's Jet Fusion 3D printer to its broad suite of technologies. Several HP codevelopment partners, including Materialise, Jabil and Shapeways, will receive their first installations of the Jet Fusion 3D printer in the next 2 weeks. Along with product installations, HP's materials innovation is gaining momentum with leaders like BASF, who has announced a commitment to the HP open materials program, and Evonik Industries, who will introduce what they expect to be the first certified material to emerge from our platform in 2017. While I've highlighted the achievements of the quarter, our core markets are still in flux, and we believe the change will only accelerate. The macroeconomic and financial market conditions are uncertain. The U.S. dollar has been strengthening, and this trend creates pressures for U.S.-based multinational companies like HP, with over 60% of revenue outside of the U.S. We know how to operate in up and down markets, and we are prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead and make the right decisions for the company for the long term. We have the right strategy entering fiscal '17 and continue to show we can deliver financial results and momentum on all parts of our business. We are setting this company up for long-term success, and I'm convinced our best years are ahead of us. I will now ask Cathie to provide incremental detail on the financials as well as our outlook for fiscal Q1 of '17.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Overall, I'm pleased with our strong finish to the fiscal year. We delivered net revenue of $12.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as reported or up 4% in constant currency. We expected revenue declines would moderate in the back half of the year, and in Q4 we saw revenue growth in EMEA and APJ both sequentially and year-over-year. Gross margin of 18.3% was down 1 point year-over-year due primarily to business segment mix, partially offset by Personal Systems rate improvement. Gross margin was flat sequentially with Print rate improvements offsetting unfavorable segment mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 8% year-over-year driven by reductions in SG&A, primarily due to corporate governance and other overhead costs related to Hewlett-Packard Company included in the prior-year period, combined with nonrevenue-generating cost savings. These reductions in SG&A were only partially offset by a deliberate 13% increase in R&D, supporting incremental investments in A3 and 3D Printing. For the year, we achieved productivity and restructuring savings which well exceeded $1 billion. With a net expense of $88 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share primarily excludes, net of tax, defined benefit plan settlement expense of $117 million and restructuring and other charges of $36 million, partially offset by net tax indemnification credits of $38 million and nonoperating retirement-related credits of $19 million. As we noted on the last 2 earnings calls, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be excluded from non-GAAP results. In Q4, GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30, above the previously provided outlook range due to lower-than-expected restructuring charges and the net tax indemnification credits. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems delivered solid performance across all metrics. Net revenue of $8 billion, up 4% year-over-year as reported or up 5% in constant currency. Units were up 5% year-over-year, with growth in Notebooks, Desktops and Workstations. Performance was also balanced across the customer segments with Consumer and Commercial revenue growth of 7% and 3% year-over-year, respectively. As Dion said, we outperformed the market and key competitors in the third calendar quarter. I'm pleased not only with the top line strength but also with the focus on profitable share gains. Personal Systems operating profit was 4.3%, up 0.6 points year-over-year due to scale, operational cost savings and a focus on higher-margin units. Much like last quarter, we saw continued revenue momentum in strategic areas including Consumer Premium, Gaming, Commercial Mobility and Services. On a year-over-year basis, Personal System ASPs were down slightly due to an increase in low-end mix and competitive pricing in Commercial, partially offset by favorable pricing in Consumer. Sequentially, ASPs were down due to normal seasonality associated with Consumer holiday sell-in, partially offset by better mix within Commercial and strong attach. Now turning to Printing. While revenue declines continued, we saw progress in all areas of focus. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 8% year-over-year as reported or down 6% in constant currency. Starting with hardware, units were up 1% year-over-year, a continued improvement in the trajectory as we've seen throughout the year. We achieved sequential share gains of 0.4 points in Laser and 1 point in Ink Hardware as the progress we made on our cost structure is creating incremental positive NPV units. We continue to improve the quality of our installed base, with Commercial units up 10% year-over-year. ASPs were up year-over-year and sequentially driven by both mix and pricing discipline. In Q4, supplies revenue was down 12% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. The supplies sales model change contributed about 7 points of the year-over-year decline, similar to the impact in Q3. The Four Box Model drivers caused a 3 to 4 point year-over-year decline in revenue in constant currency. Supplies revenue mix was 62%, down 3 points year-over-year. About 2 points of the decline can be attributed to the supplies model change that we executed during the quarter. As a result of this supplies model transition, we exited the second half where we expected to be, with a significant reduction in both weeks and dollars of the channel inventory. Operating profit for Printing was 14%, down 2.9 points year-over-year, related primarily to the reduction in supplies revenue. Unlike Q3, we did not have material gains from the sale of Software assets to offset the reduction of channel inventory associated with our supplies model change. We had an unfavorable mix of supplies, combined with incremental R&D spend to support A3 and 3D Printing, which remain key long-term growth drivers. These investments were partially offset by strong operational improvements across the business. And in restructuring, we achieved our accelerated plan as announced at the start of the fiscal year and with lower charges than expected. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was $698 million, and free cash flow was $558 million. The cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, flat sequentially and down 10 days year-over-year. On a sequential basis, days of inventory were up 2 days, offset by a 2-day improvement in accounts payable as a result of the strategic use of our balance sheet, including increased sea shipments and component purchases for the assurance of supply, given the tight supply environment that we talked about last quarter. During the quarter, we had total capital return of $214 million primarily through cash dividend. For the full year, we returned 72% of free cash flow to shareholders, at the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range. Looking ahead, we've assumed the following in our financial outlook: in Personal Systems, we anticipate component shortages to continue and have an impact on profitability in the short term; supplies revenue growth in constant currency is still expected to stabilize by the end of '17, but the trajectory will not be linear given the unit placement trajectory in fiscal '16; in Q1, we expect the 4 boxes in our model to drive a mid-single-digit decline, pressuring total company revenue, growth and profit. For the full year, we have assumed we will deliver on our additional productivity initiatives and restructuring activities as announced at SAM, which we expect will drive improved profitability over the course of the year. And more broadly, we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty that could impact market sizing and competitive dynamics, especially related to unfavorable currency moves. A significant deterioration could have a material impact on revenue and profit especially in supplies, given its tight correlation to gross domestic product growth. Note also that our outlook assumes currency rates as of the end of October. With all that in mind, our Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.35 to $0.38; Q1 '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.33 to $0.36; our full year fiscal '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share remains in the range of $1.55 to $1.65; and our full year fiscal '17 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations remains in the range of $1.47 to $1.57. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim Suva at Citi.
Jim Suva: You did very well in the PC segment. And previously, you made some comments about you were using your balance sheet to procure components. And it turns out that, that ended up being a very wise decision. Can you help us understand 2 things? First of all, are you continuing to do so? And if so, how long do you think you'll continue to do so or have the need to? And second of all, with the shortages of supply and you were able to get the components, how come your gross margins for PCs were not -- your operating margins for PCs were not stronger quarter-over-quarter as the revenues grew considerably quarter-over-quarter but operating margins didn't? Did you like reinvest some of the money? Or how should we think about why more of the PC didn't flow through?
Dion Weisler: Okay. Great. Thanks, and thanks, Jim. Let me say, broadly speaking, that the basket of components that make up a PC, there's some components in there that are in ready supply. There's other components in there that are in tighter supply, as we alluded to on the last call. And indeed, we did say we would leverage the balance sheet to go off and ensure that we procured. That is one of the changes that I've often talked about and a common theme that we have in the business, to take that change and turn it into opportunity. I think the team executed really well in the course of quarter 4 against that backdrop. I think the team did trifecta squared last quarter: They grew revenue, margin and share and they did it again this quarter, and I was pleased with their performance. Specifically on the margin rates, I'll let Cathie chime in.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Thanks, Jim. In terms of the margin rates, it was competitive pricing on a sequential basis but also normal seasonality, because we're really talking about kind of the sell-in for the holiday period of time, and that tends to have a higher Consumer mix. We did see ASPs basically up in Commercial on a sequential basis. But again, normal seasonality drove ASPs down for Consumer and overall down.
Operator: Next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: Just a clarification from me. On the supply side, Cathie, you said it's not going to be linear, which you said before, I think. But when I look at this quarter, if you back out the 7-point hit on growth in supplies from the inventory drawdown, I know there's probably some currency impact in there as well. The supplies business is probably down quite low single-digits. You're quite close to getting back to stability. Is there a reason why, let's say, in the first half of the year that could get worse before it gets better, if you can just explain some of those dynamics. Maybe it's comps, maybe it's how you're placing units right now, anything along those lines as we think about the next few quarters before you hit that more stable point by the end of '17 would be helpful.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Kulbinder. In terms of the -- what we are now coining the Four Box drivers, the Four Box drivers actually had a decline in constant currency for the quarter in minus 3% to minus 4%. So when you make all of the adjustments that you need to make to get to that -- and that's pretty consistent with the last 3 quarters, okay? So I think that's the way to think about it. I think it's also important, if I could add a point here, and that's just that we use the model to determine what we think is going to happen in the quarter as well as what we think is going to happen over time. And we were operating pretty much in line with what we had expected. So the quarter came in, in line. For next quarter, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline, and that's really due to how we were placing units. If you go back to last year, in Q1 we were down 20% in terms of unit placements. In Q2 we were down 16%. Kind of Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4 we started to grow sequentially and, in fact, from Q3 to Q4 we grew sequentially units about 10% this quarter. And so we're starting to get an improvement, frankly, in the absolute level of the installed base. And so that's one of the boxes in the Four Box Model, and that's putting some pressure on -- early on in FY '17. And so it's really more the back half. But the way I think about how you all can get comfortable believing and having confidence that we're going to stabilize the supplies revenue by the end of '17 in constant currency is really because we're reporting out what the model said we would do at the beginning and how we're reporting -- beginning of the quarter and we're reporting out how well we did relative to that. So far, the model has been pretty predictive. And certainly over a longer history it has been very predictive. And so we feel good about the progress that we're making.
Operator: The next question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: How does the return to growth in printer units impact the Four Box Model and your confidence exiting the year with flat supplies? And then just a follow-up, you had talked at the Analyst Day about potentially reducing Printer Hardware channel inventory during fiscal '17. Is that something you still expect to happen? And is the impact baked into guidance?
Dion Weisler: Okay. So in terms of the units, Katy, what we talked about almost this time last year was the fact that we expected the overall environment to continue to be challenging, as a result of that we would need to consider this the new normal and we went to work on taking costs out of the business so that we could turn negative NPV units into positive NPV units and expand the TAM. And through the course of the year, that bridge that Cathie just walked you through, negative 20% in quarter 1, negative 16% in quarter 2, negative 10% in quarter 3, plus 1% in quarter 4 was a plan that we began executing after the Q1 earnings call. And so we have built that into our model, and our model is, therefore, predicting that we will indeed return to stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency. So it's running according to plan, but it's not just the units, as we've often talked about, Katy, it's the quality of the units. Our Managed Print Services had another very strong quarter from a TCV perspective, as did our Graphics business, 13th consecutive growth quarter in constant currency for the Graphics business. Instant Ink, which is an important initiative for the home-based business, had strong enrollees yet again. And so many of the dimensions that we've talked about, not just the unit placement but the quality of the units, is operating according to our outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: And Katy, to the second part of your question about whether or not we have made a change to the sales model for Hardware as we have done for the supplies within print, the answer is that our outlook today, as is the same at SAM, does not include a change in that go-to-market model. We are still analyzing whether or not we want to do that and what it would take to do that.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I'm wondering if you could comment on the planned marketing investments and demand stimulation investments that you were planning for Q4 and whether you made them at the level that you thought and whether you got the acceleration in units that you thought. The reason I ask is it looks like Printer Hardware sort of improved with normal seasonality in Q4. And certainly the way you talked about last quarter was that your demand stimulation efforts would yield something significantly higher than that. So I'm wondering if you can comment, did you invest what you expected to invest? And did you get the kind of demand stimulation that you thought? And then I'm still struggling with how you can be looking at supplies growth being so weak in Q1 given that your comparison is so easy and your supplies is a function of your last 3 to 6 years' worth of sales. And so you shipped $100 million less in each of Q1 and Q2 in hardware. I don't know how that can mathematically translate into a deceleration against an extra comp on supplies growth going forward. Is there anything else there in terms of your plan to take down further inventory or anything else happening in the channel that might explain that? Because the math doesn't seem to work.
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with the first question around marketing. So yes, we did execute on our marketing plans in Q4. And just to be clear, our marketing plans related to the supplies change that we were making is really not about stimulating demand at the hardware level. It's really about stimulating demand for HP-branded supplies. So it's about awareness and -- building awareness and brand preference and print relevance. So kind of helping people understand why they should want to print. And we did execute on that. The unit acceleration was actually ahead of what is normal seasonality for us. So sequentially we grew units 10%, and our normal sequential is kind of the 7% to 8%. So we're feeling good about the progress that we made. We did get acceleration on the Hardware side. In terms of your second question around supplies growth, why is it that weak in Q1, at this point in time, Toni, when we put through all of the different variables and all of the assumptions that we've got within our model, we are calling for a mid-single-digit decline in supplies in constant currency on a year-over-year basis in Q1 and that, even with that, the model is still basically supporting the forecast that revenue in -- supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17.
Operator: Our next question is from Rod Hall at JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I wanted to go back to the Printing business and the margins. Margins dropped off more than we thought that they would in the quarter. And we see this unit number stabilization is a little bit better than we thought it would be. So I'm just curious how you would expect that margin to track through the beginning of the year, especially given the yen strength. Because it seems like, if you guys want to achieve your goals in supplies, you need to keep placing these units. If the yen -- or I'm sorry, the yen weakness. If the yen continues to weaken, then you may find that more difficult to do. So I just wanted to check that in light of the currency movements.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. There's actually a few different questions in there, so let me see if I can hit them. The first one, in terms of the OP rate of 14% in Q4, that was, in fact, very much in line with what we had expected and what we talked about on the Q3 earnings call. And the reason it is off -- significantly off of Q3, which was 20.4%, is really the result of the last stage, the last quarter of the supplies sales model transition that we were going through without having the compensating software divestiture gains. Those all showed up in Q3 at the same time that roughly half of the plan for supplies transition was going through. So if you actually normalize over the year, the OP rate for Print was in line with what we've seen in the past, mid-teens at 17%. So I don't think there's any big surprises there. And that 14%, obviously consistent with what we said on the Q3 earnings call. So we had in our own forecast the fact that we were going to place these incremental units already. In terms of your question about kind of the Japanese competitors and the foreign exchange environment, I have to tell you it's a little bit hard to answer that one with clarity, and let me explain why. First, I think it's a very uncertain kind of macroeconomic environment, and it's hard to know what's going to happen on a go-forward basis, like from the U.S. administration, what kind of policies are going to be put in place and what -- the impact that's going to have on currencies. And then it's even more complicated because in many ways we didn't see broad-based kind of relaxation on aggressive pricing from the Japanese competitors when the yen was stronger. So now that it's weakened a bit in the last few weeks, it's unclear whether or not they're going to be more aggressive or this is just an opportunity for them to hold the pricing that they've had all along. It's just not clear. What is clear to us is that in our outlook for FY '17, we have assumed no change in the pricing environment. So we haven't assumed that even though the yen is a bit stronger kind of relative to '16, we have not assumed that the Japanese ease up on pricing, nor have we assumed that they get more aggressive.
Operator: The next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I was hoping to get a little more detail on the strength in the PC business, the linearity in the quarter and also how sustainable is that strength into next quarter as well as further out?
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Sherri. So I would say that the PC market is operating as we expected it to. I still think there's uncertainty in the market. The market as a whole hasn't returned to growth. At the beginning of the year we anticipated that -- we expected the declines would moderate through the course of '16, and they did. And we were able to adjust to that market I think much more quickly than many of our competitors. As a benefit of being a separated company, the speed, flexibility, focus of the organization was able to react to these market conditions. And as a result of that, we've performed significantly better than the market and taken a solid premium to the market. I think longer term the business will continue to evolve and develop. There's a very large continuum of devices, everything from a smartphone all the way up to a workstation. Some of that market we participate in, not all of that market, but the lines are blurring between the different categories within that spectrum. And indeed, categories are being created in the x3. Elite x3 is a great example of a device that bridges from sort of a phablet all the way through to a PC and a laptop. So I would characterize that the market is changing, we're ahead of that curve, we're skating towards where we believe the puck is going and investing in the heat of the market that we find particularly attractive. I think the team did a great job in our Gaming platform, in the Premium segment, in Commercial Mobility, whether it be x2 or x3, and we're unlocking part of the market that we are still attracted by. Let's remember, it's a $320 billion TAM, and about half of that are things like services, displays, accessories that we have lower market share and we're looking to expand our business and the team is expanding our business there. So we still think there is great opportunity within the Personal Systems environment. It's a changing market landscape. It has improved from the beginning of last year. And we don't broadly disagree with the outlook from the analysts, but I think what you can expect us to do is continue to deliver ahead of the market.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me just -- you also asked a question about linearity in the quarter. The linearity in the quarter was normal, so there was nothing particular to call out. It was normal, historical linearity.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross at Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Dion, can you talk a bit about what you're thinking with regard to A3? You've now had -- well, you've announced the Samsung acquisition a couple of months ago, had some time to digest it. So I'm curious as to what you're hearing from your channel partners, if there's been any change to how you're thinking about the approach, relationships with Canon, what you're planning on with Samsung's printers, just if you could give us a bit more color.
Dion Weisler: Sure. I would say, Shannon, that the acquisition is -- and the integration is running according to our timeline. We expect it to close within the 9 to 12 months from the original announcement date. The team is on the ground working very closely with Samsung counterparts to get this done. We continue to be incredibly impressed with the quality and the caliber of the people as well as the technology. Of course, Samsung represents more than 10% of South Korea's total GDP and attract the very best talent in the entire country. And having that group of very high-caliber engineering and other folks join our company is very impressive. The 6,500 patents are very high-quality patents as we continue to work through that. And it gives us all the opportunity to disrupt this $55 billion market. So that's on the Samsung side. We've been running a separate track really through the course of the entire '16 as we were looking to really aggressively enter the A3 market on the go-to-market side of things. And I have traveled all around the world, met with the largest A3 channel partners, most -- many of which are not channel partners for HP today, some of which are. The Venn diagram is not mutually exclusive here. And I think we've made tremendous progress. We've shared with them the value proposition of working with HP and our disruption in the space. And we have an incredible amount of interest right across the globe from these go-to-market partners as we begin to unlock and even begin quoting on opportunities that we expect to deliver on as we launch the products in the April time frame.
Operator: The next question comes from Simona Jankowski at Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Cathie, I think you began to touch on this, but I would love to hear more of your takeaways on the potential implications of the U.S. election, in particular as it pertains to the potential changes to the tax code as well as tariffs.
Catherine Lesjak: Simona, it's really too early to have a strong opinion on all of the different proposals that are out there because there are so many. And so it's unclear at this point in time exactly what the situation is going to be and how it might impact HP and what actions HP might take as a result of those policy changes.
Dion Weisler: I would add that we obviously support comprehensive tax reform that makes us more globally competitive. We support multinationals having fair access to overseas markets and the flexibly to operate global supply chains. But I think Cathie's quite right. It's very early days. We operate in 170 countries around the world, and our mission here is to deliver experiences that amaze and we want to be able to do that in an environment -- in an appropriate tax environment and in an appropriate global environment.
Operator: The next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: Just to clarify, can you clarify whether your guidance includes any real estate sale gains from your San Diego campus? And then for the question, can you just talk about PC channel inventory out there and whether you think there's a risk of greater than seasonal decline into the calendar first quarter given the relative strength we've been seeing?
Catherine Lesjak: Sorry. I didn't catch that last one. You're talking about PC channel inventory levels?
Maynard Um: Right, PC channel inventory and whether you thought there was greater risk going into Q1 given the relative strength we've been seeing recently.
Dion Weisler: So I think PC channel inventory from our perspective, from an HP perspective, is well under control and well within our ranges. Of course, you all know my view on the profile of the inventory. Not just the absolute amount of inventory but the aged element of the inventory is also very well under control. This is a situation that I think is incredibly important to maintain the momentum inside this business. We're well under control. Given we're operating now in a different environment than we have been for many years where we've had an oversupply, we're in an environment now where there is more of an undersupply. And so as a result of that, I think overall channel inventory levels across the broad landscape are lower than they have been, let's say, this time last year.
Catherine Lesjak: And in terms of your question about the San Diego sale, we don't typically go into that level of detail. If at any time a transaction is material enough, then we will call it out.
Operator: The next question is from Steve Milunovich at UBS.
Steven Milunovich: I just wondered, relative to the Analyst Day, if there are any material changes in either the EPS or free cash flow bridges that you provided? And in particular, I wanted to ask about the productivity improvements, which I think were tagged at $0.43 to $0.47 for fiscal '17. Could you be a bit specific about where those are coming from and your confidence level on achieving those?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. In terms of the EPS bridge and the cash flow bridge, the answer is no, there's no material change to them. If you want more, I'll follow up on that. I'll let you give me a follow-up in a minute. On the productivity side of the house, it is -- there is not a single silver bullet for us to -- or a lever to pull. It's really going to be across a number of dimensions. And it's all the things that we've been talking about in '16 that, frankly, have opportunity in '17 as well: simplification of our portfolio, really focusing on the BOM cost and making sure that every interconnector is exactly what -- we need that interconnector and every piece of metal is -- we need metal, we can't use plastic. I mean really reengineering constantly the new products at the same time we're simplifying our portfolio. We're also doing process reengineering. And that -- we're doing process reengineering in finance, we're doing it in sales ops, we're doing it in legal, we're doing it everywhere in the company. And technology enables us to take new processes and automate pieces of those processes. And so we're looking at that basically across the company. And my view is that's probably never done. There's always new technology coming out that helps you improve a process from an efficiency perspective. And then also just broadly staying completely focused on reducing nonrevenue-generating cost everywhere we need to do that. I think there are opportunities in warranty we've seen. There's opportunities in making sure that the discounts that we're giving are giving us the appropriate return. I mean, it's just all of these items. And they're probably the same list of items that I would've given you a year ago. There's just more to do and there's always more costs that we need to stay focused on taking out.
Steven Milunovich: That's great. Maybe I would ask what PSG and printer operating margins are implied by your full year EPS guidance.
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't break them out specifically. But the way we think about the Personal Systems business is that it's roughly a 3% to 4% operating margin business. Now there are quarters in which it's higher than that and there are quarters when it's a little bit lower than that. But that's kind of how we think about the rate of the business.
Dion Weisler: We also think about absolute dollars, more importantly.
Catherine Lesjak: I was going to add that. In the big scheme of things, what we're really focused on is operating profit dollars. So if there's kind of some low end SKUs where we can scrape out some gross margin dollars but it will dilute the rate, we still do it. We're focused on profitable growth, and profitable growth is designed to be basically dropping dollars to the bottom line. And so -- but I think we think about it in the 3% to 4%. On the Print side of the house, we've seen in '16 kind of mid-teens. If you go back a few years, it's kind of generally been in the mid-teens space, and we would expect that, that would be true in '17 as well.
Dion Weisler: And from an entire business perspective, we've always said for the long term expect us to be in the 8% to 10% range.
Catherine Lesjak: And I will also -- just if I can put a plug in here for the Print business, if there's an opportunity, because of the cost structure actions that we've taken, that we actually create a significantly bigger pool of NPV-positive units that we can go after, the team knows that we will drop below what -- the mid-teens. What's important is setting up -- making the right investments every day in that business and setting this business up to maximize the area under the curve. Right now, our range is kind of mid-teens.
Operator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Jyhhaw Liu: This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. As it relates to your supplies channel inventory actions, I know it's still early, but can you talk about if you have seen these actions contribute to progress toward a more stabilized supplies pricing environment? And if so, how does that compare with your internal expectations?
Dion Weisler: I would say, broadly speaking, the shift from push to pull is operating according to our expectations. I think we have much less product on promotion than we had in the past, and that's in a more stabilized pricing environment in an omnichannel world that is incredibly sensitive to large fluctuations in end user pricing. So that was the desired effect. I think we've seen significantly lower gray marketing from region to region. That was also one of the key design points. So still very early days but the signals are the right signals and the model is operating according to how we expected it to operate.
Catherine Lesjak: I would say that it's -- add to that, it's -- we feel like we've really successfully executed over the last couple of quarters and that we are now making changes to operational metrics and how we drive that business because of the new environment. We specifically have reduced our channel inventory target ranges and narrowed them. And we exited Q4 -- if we had applied those same ranges in Q4 of '16, we would be within those ranges. So we feel really good about that -- the progress there. And then the other thing is that we are really hearing from our channel partners that they believe this was the right thing to do, that given the omnichannel realities that they have to deal with and we have to deal with, these actions were the right things to do.
Dion Weisler: Completely unquestioned support from the channel partners.
Operator: The last question is from James Kisner at Jefferies.
James Kisner: I want to drill down on the Desktop unit strength. I don't think we talked about this in the call. But I think it's the first unit growth quarter we've seen in 8 quarters. Wondering what the dynamics are there. Were there specific promotions happening there? Are you seeing a turn in the desktop market, any particular models driving that? Just any color on that would be helpful.
Dion Weisler: Yes, look, we're really pleased. I mean, of course Notebooks had another really strong quarter of growth, units up 9%. But it was great to see Desktop revenue grow 2%, units up 1% year-over-year. No magic here; really hard work. The team went to work at the beginning of -- actually midway through '15 began redesigning the entire supply chain to take costs out of that, redesigning the entire lineup. I think we've got some incredibly innovative products here that are really resonating with customers. They're now in the right price function value equation. And when you get that right, when you do the segmentation and you get the cost right and there is value, then you end up with a better result, and that's what we're seeing with the performance of the Desktop business.
James Kisner: I mean, do you think the market is also doing better? Is it really just you outperforming, or are we seeing an inflection in the market also?
Dion Weisler: I'd say broadly speaking the market -- depends what your relative point is. If you look at this time last year, the market is doing a lot better than it was a year ago. And it was -- if I recall correctly, it was double-digit negative. It was like negative 12%. And we're in sort of mid-single digits now. We're executing better than the market at a significant premium, and we're getting upside as a result of that. So thank you for those questions. I know it is late on the eve before many of you are going to take off here for Thanksgiving. I do want to sort of close off with saying I was really proud of what the team did in quarter 4 and how we rounded out the year. I think we enter FY '17 on an upward momentum trajectory, and that's a very different position to what we were in this time last year, as you will recall. I think there's a lot of change going on within the industry, within the macroeconomic environment, but we're adapting to that change and we're turning it to our opportunity. We know how to operate in both up and down markets. We believed that this was going to be the new normal, and we set ourselves up from a cost position to be leaner athletes as we enter this environment. And I think through the course of last year, we were able to demonstrate quarter after quarter that we would do what we said we would do, and I feel proud about that. I think we're entering '17 with the right strategy, executing on core growth in future and leading in the market where we choose to play and not chasing share for share's sake. But profitable growth is very important to us. And stabilizing supplies by the end of '17 in constant currency is also incredibly important to us and I know for all our investors as well. I have great confidence in HP, and I'm really convinced that the best years lie ahead of us. Thank you for taking the time. Happy Thanksgiving.
Catherine Lesjak: Happy Thanksgiving.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2016 Q3  (2016-08-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Q3 2016 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Austin, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon. I'm Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2016 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported on HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased with the progress we continue to make. This quarter's results are all about focus and execution. We continue to be disciplined to deliver in our core, gain momentum in our growth segments and hit strategic milestones in our future initiatives. Let me start with our overall performance in the third quarter. We achieved all of our financial objectives. We delivered non-GAAP net earnings per share of $0.48, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered solid free cash flow of $1 billion as a result of strength in Personal Systems and a continued focus on working capital metrics, and we returned nearly $300 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As we move towards the end of our fiscal year, we are seeing the benefits of the significant productivity initiatives and restructuring actions we put in place at the start of this year. We are on track to implement more than $1 billion of savings, providing us opportunity to invest back into our businesses to drive long-term success. In Q3, our revenue trajectory improved, down less than 1% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strength in Personal Systems, offset by expected declines in Printing. As we previously said, we believed overall revenue declines would moderate in the second half of the year, and that is exactly what is happening. The PC market improved slightly more than forecasted, and we were well positioned with an innovative product lineup and healthy channel inventory level. We capitalized on market opportunities and gained share at the expense of our competitors, especially in the high-end premium category. The innovation in our portfolio is serving us well. We are building on a rich heritage and delivering experiences that amaze our customers and partners. Our products and solutions contain the magic that differentiate HP from the competition. This past quarter, our Printing and Personal Systems teams delivered awe-inspiring innovation. The Spectre 13 that we announced in April rolled out in countries around the world continues to elicit acclaim and praise, fueling our push into premium devices. Likewise, the OMEN gaming platform is built for greatness or, as those in the gaming world would like to say, domination. And new OMEN laptops and desktops all launched to rave reviews and strong consumer demand based on their performance and engineering power. On the commercial go-to-market side, customers are increasingly shifting from transactional to contractual buying, wanting everything as a service. At the end of June, we unveiled our new PC-as-a-service business model that is gaining interest from companies around the world. Importantly, these premium gaming and service initiatives are all profit accretive. Moving to Printing highlights. HP's presence at drupa was unprecedented. Our graphics business sold a record 130 Indigo presses. Our large-format and digital printers, including PageWide technology, are accelerating the industry transformation from analog print to digital, opening new categories of packaging, print production and specialized ink innovation. During the quarter, we also unveiled the world's smallest all-in-one inkjet printer, helping to reinvent the printing experience for a mobile and socially-connected consumer. And earlier in May, we announced the world's first production-ready 3D printing system. We continue to work with our ecosystem of manufacturers, co-development and strategic partners like Nike, BMW, Order Desk, Jabil, Johnson & Johnson, Shapeways, Siemens and others, and have now placed a number of demo units. Our partners are pleased and enthusiastically engaged in putting our technology to work printing sample parts for automotive, consumer goods, medical and other applications. Most recently, BMW announced plans to use 3D printing for their new Rolls-Royce Dawn. And materials partner, Evonik, announced plans for a series of custom powder materials on our open platform that will further 3D printing as a viable form of manufacturing for many businesses. Now turning to the segments' specific performance. Personal Systems executed very well with revenue growth, share gains and improved profitability. We outperformed both the market and all key competitors in our core business while gaining momentum in our strategic growth segments including Commercial Mobility and Services. Sequentially, Personal Systems revenue grew by 7.5%, better than normal seasonality. Our strong performance resulted in market share gains year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in all 3 regions. I've said many times, our focus is on profitable share gains. We gained 1.8 points of PC unit share year-over-year in calendar Q2 2016 while delivering significant operating profit improvement. Innovation, coupled with continued focus on cost management, was instrumental in driving these results. I'm especially pleased with our Consumer business. The strength of our high-end premium and gaming portfolios supported improved gross margins both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. In Commercial, we performed well, but margins were pressured by an unfavorable mix shift to Chromebooks. In the quarter, we had outstanding wins with customers like Volvo, where we signed a 3-year device as a service contract to deliver elite PCs and workstations together with care packs, factory services and priority support to more than 25,000 users across all regions. Shifting to Printing results. In line with our expectations, revenue declined year-over-year in the third quarter but with some improvement. Starting with hardware. We have made steady progress with unit sales down 10% year-over-year as compared to 20% in Q1 and 16% in Q2. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, hardware units grew 6%, well above normal seasonality. This supported sequential market share gains of 2 points in laser and 1 point in ink hardware in calendar quarter 2. The market remained very challenging, and our progress was a direct result of discipline and operational rigor. We did what we said by both reducing discounts, as evidenced by year-over-year improvements in constant currency ASPs and improving our cost structure to enable a more positive NPV unit growth sequentially. Recall that not all printers are created equally. Our key objective is to place hardware units with a higher usage of supplies. As a proof point, for the 17th consecutive quarter, we gained share in the value multifunction laser printers, a strategic product segment, given the associated higher supplies usage. We are more challenged in our business ink products, where we drove pricing discipline and lost some share. While our Japanese competitors are talking about shifting their focus from share to profits due to the strength of the yen, it is not broadly evident yet that this is showing up in less aggressive pricing. Turning to supplies. In Q3, we began to execute the sales model changes we discussed earlier this quarter. As we shared on our call on June 21, we made a strategic decision to evolve how we run and manage our supplies business in recognition of the changing market dynamics, given global price transparency. To harmonize pricing, we determined an increase in marketing combined with a reduction in channel inventory levels was necessary, and we took the first step in the third quarter. With continued support from our channel partners, the execution is on track. We will continue to implement operational changes to our supplies inventory management in the fourth quarter and will provide a further update on our Q4 earnings call. In Q3, we also continued to make progress in our shift from transactional to contractual sales. Managed Print Services revenue was up again year-over-year in constant currency. And on the consumer side, we saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, our subscription-based supply service, with cumulative enrollee growth and low churn. Beyond home and office printing, graphics delivered another quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Following our success at drupa, we increased our HP Indigo manufacturing capabilities to fulfill orders, including 25 of the latest HP Indigo presses for Shutterfly to support operations for the peak holiday season. Our PageWide web press platform will deliver high-quality and high-speed on one press. Installations are scheduled to begin this fall. And in corrugated packaging, the PageWide T-Series deals signed at drupa are in installation phases around the world. Overall, we delivered on our financial commitments in the third quarter, and I'm pleased with our progress. However, with the markets remaining challenging and somewhat volatile, we have more work to do. We will keep our eye on cost controls while continuing to focus on executing our strategy, protecting our core business through solid execution, delivering our growth initiatives and investing in category-creating opportunities for the future. And now I'll turn the call over to Cathie.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Q3 results were largely in line with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.9 billion, down 4% year-over-year as reported or down just 1% in constant currency. Our revenue trajectory improved significantly in the Americas and EMEA, and APJ continued to perform well. Gross margin of 18.3% was down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by the unfavorable mix shift to Personal Systems and the reduction in supplies, largely due to the impact of the changes in the supplies sales model, partially offset by gross margin expansion across Personal Systems. Not fully evident in the year-over-year compare is the steady progress the teams have made improving our cost structure. Gross margin was down 1.1 points quarter-over-quarter, due primarily to unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in Printing, partially offset by favorable product premium mix in Personal Systems. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.1 billion were down 25% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A as we recorded gains from the divestiture of the marketing optimization software assets. Recall that we leverage these latest gains to offset the impact of the reduced supplies into the channel related to the strategic sales model changes. We also achieved year-over-year savings via the previously communicated productivity improvements and restructuring actions. With a net expense of $55 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.48. As compared to our previously provided outlook range, we recorded a higher gain from the divestiture as a result of closing more countries in Q3 than expected. The impact of the reduction in supplies revenue into the channel was in line with what we expected. The net of these amounted to about a $0.02 shift into Q3 from what we had forecasted for Q4. Non-GAAP net earnings per share primarily excludes restructuring and other charges of $36 million, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $38 million and tax indemnification credits of $29 million. As we noted on the Q2 earnings call, the tax indemnification changes relate to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. On a GAAP basis, Q3 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.49. Turning to the segments. Personal Systems net revenue was $7.5 billion, flat year-over-year and up 2% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was up 8%, while commercial revenue was down 3% year-over-year as reported. We outperformed the market overall as well as in the commercial and consumer markets while staying focused on gaining profitable share. We saw momentum in certain segments of the market, particularly in consumer, and took advantage of the opportunities presented with innovative products, including the x360, Spectre 13 and the new OMEN gaming portfolio. As a result of our continued focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in Commercial Mobility, especially detachables, and in Services. Personal Systems ASPs were flat sequentially and down low single digits year-over-year. We continued to see a decline in commercial ASPs year-over-year, given the increased mix of Chromebooks. However, consumer ASPs improved both year-over-year and sequentially due to a strong premium mix. Personal Systems operating profit rate was 4.4%, up 1.6 points year-over-year, driven by gross margin expansion and tight expense management. Gross margin improvement was driven by cost reductions and premium mix, exceeding currency headwinds and competitive pricing. Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.4 billion, down 14% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. We made good progress, particularly in hardware placements. Hardware units were down 10% year-over-year, significantly better than 16% last quarter as the cost actions we continue to implement increased the number of positive NPV units that could be placed. We attribute approximately 5 to 6 points of the year-over-year decline to the market, and the rest of the decline is split between less attractive units and channel inventory reductions in Q3 '16. In Q3, supplies revenue was down 18% year-over-year as reported or down 13% in constant currency, in line with our expectations. Approximately 7 points of the constant currency decline was associated with the planned reduction of supplies sales into the channel, with the remainder being a combination of the separation-related channel inventory build in Q3 '15 and declines in our Four Box Model drivers. While Four Box Model drivers declined year-over-year, they performed in line with what we expected. Q3 supplies revenue mix was 64%, down approximately 3 points both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily due to the planned reduction of sales into the channel. Supplies channel inventory was down year-over-year and within our targeted range. Operating profit for Printing was 20.4%, up 3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by the gain from the software asset divestiture in excess of the expected supplies channel inventory reduction and marketing investments. Related to the divestiture announcement on June 20, we recorded a gain of $280 million in SG&A. This was greater than the estimate of $245 million provided on the June 21 supplies call due to the acceleration of the close into Q3. This will not have an EPS impact overall for the full fiscal year but will mean that Q4 will be lower by about $0.02 compared to what we guided in June. R&D for Printing was up both year-over-year and sequentially due to the ramp-up of investments to support A3 copiers and 3D printing. Moving to an update on restructuring. Approximately 1,000 people exited the company in Q3 and approximately 2,300 year-to-date. The FY '16 restructuring activities are on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the fiscal year. We continue to seek efficiencies in our processes and will likely have more savings opportunities beyond 2016. The potential related actions will be announced at a later date, once we have a plan in place. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.1 billion, and free cash flow was approximately $1 billion. Cash conversion cycle was negative 29 days, a 5-day sequential improvement, driven by an 8-day increase in days payable outstanding, offset by a 3-day increase in days of inventory. Days payable outstanding increased due primarily to Personal Systems, which had favorable linearity, volume and supplier mix. Days of inventory was up largely in line with normal seasonality. During our third fiscal quarter, we repurchased 4.5 million shares and paid $212 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $269 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly be within and potentially above our original 50% to 75% target range for returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full fiscal year. Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for Q4. In Personal Systems, in line with the external analysts, we expect the market to be down mid- to high single digits year-over-year, with incremental pressure in the Commercial segment. In Printing, we expect to continue to make progress on our cost structure, giving us the opportunity to place more NPV-positive units. As a result, we expect print revenue and hardware unit declines to continue to moderate year-over-year. Our execution of the change in the supplies sales model is expected to be in line with the $225 million reduction in revenue that we guided in June. We believe declines in supplies revenue in constant currency will continue but moderate. Supplies revenue is still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. In Q4 and beyond, the uncertainty in the market caused by Brexit could create challenges, particularly in EMEA. A negative impact in gross domestic product could introduce risk to our revenue, particularly supplies, given the correlation we've seen in the past. We will continue to provide updates as things progress and more definitive information is available. As it relates to cash flow assumptions, in Q3, we started to note some issues with component supply availability in the Personal Systems market, given vendors shifting capacity to other product category. In Q4, we intend to opportunistically leverage the balance sheet for assurance of supply, which is expected to increase owned inventory and extend the cash conversion cycle by a few days. We also expect our capital expenditures to be greater in Q4 as compared to Q3. And lastly, we expect Printing revenue to be better sequentially as compared to lower quarter-on-quarter revenue growth in Personal Systems. On a GAAP-only basis, we assumed a settlement expense of approximately $200 million for a lump-sum offering we made during Q3 to certain terminated vested participants in the U.S. pension plan. With all that in mind, Q4 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Q4 '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.22 to $0.25. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.62. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.46 to $1.49. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Cathie, the 20.4% printer operating margin, what would that have been without the gains?
Catherine Lesjak: So it would've been about 3 points lower, so in line with what we saw in Q1 and Q2. And in fact, the best way to think about the shift from Q4 into Q3, because most of the gain has shown up in Q3, is to think about the halves. So in the first half, we were running in the 17% operating margin rate. And we would expect normalized across both quarters to be roughly in that same zone.
Steven Milunovich: Understood. And you commented a bit on the Four Box Model being a little bit worse but still within your expectations. Could you talk about each of those boxes and what's going on?
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't go through each of the boxes in detail. I just want to make sure that you understood the comment. So the comment was that on a year-over-year basis, the Four Box Model showed a decline in supply. And that is roughly minus 3%, minus 4%, again in line with what we saw last quarter as well. What I did then -- what Dion then did say is that while the Four Box Model was down, it was in line with what we had expected, so again giving a proof point to the fact that the model is a good predictor of what the results are going to be.
Operator: And our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: Cathie, just going back to the previous one. If the gain was $290 million and your Printing revenues are roughly $4.4 billion, the margin -- the underlying margin would've been more like 14%. Am I doing something wrong?
Catherine Lesjak: Well, you didn't take the fact that we told you that we were going to take that in divestiture gains and we were going to reinvest it. We were going to reinvest it in bringing channel inventories down, supplies channel inventories down, over the course of the half by $450 million. And we were also going to increase our marketing investments. So what the real impact is, to Q3, on the upside is that we had the gain offset by half of the investment that we were going to make. But then in Q4, we're going to have the second half of the investment and almost no gain to offset it.
Kulbinder Garcha: Okay. And so basically, if I understand it correctly, there's no reason after this quarter why you believe, going forward once we pass the next one, why margins in Printing shouldn't be in the normal range we've seen over the last few years. Is that a reasonable assumption?
Catherine Lesjak: That's exactly how you should think about it. It's just a shift between quarters. The half is in line with what we would expect. We've taken these gains, and we have -- as we told you we would do on the June 21 call, we have reinvested it back into getting our channel inventories lower for the new model that we're executing on as well as incremental investments we're making in marketing in order to drive better awareness and preference for HP branded supplies.
Kulbinder Garcha: Okay. And then one final clarification. The supplies revenue base is basically depressed because of this channel inventory clear-up. That's why that normalizes at some point by end of the year.
Catherine Lesjak: By the end of 2017, we do expect revenue in constant currency to stabilize. So if you look at the supplies revenue decline, it's down 18% as reported, 13% in constant currency, so about 5 points of currency. And then the supplies actions that we took in Q3 contribute to another about 7 points of supplies decline. And then the remainder is, again, there was a buildup in channel inventory a year ago because we were separating the IT systems and we wanted to make sure we didn't stock out. And so that impact was there, and then also this roughly 3% to 4% decline from the Four Boxes. That makes sense?
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I had a question as we sort of look forward with margins. When we think about Printing margins, I understand the give and takes of what's going on right now. But given what you've seen, the opportunity for incremental restructuring, are you sort of targeting around the 17% operating margin? And sort of similarly, Dion, if you can talk about your margin expectations on the PC side. Because clearly, you've been able to find profitable sales in a relatively challenged market. And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't -- Shannon, we don't have an explicit target for operating margin in Printing. Each quarter it's a combination of obviously the -- what's going to be, ultimately, the demand for supplies, given the new model that we're working on, and then also how many positive NPV units can we actually place. And so one of the things I'll call out -- even though I have said that in the second half I do think that the margins are going to be kind of in that 17% range for Printing. We are significantly, from Q3 to Q4, we are significantly increasing the amount of NPV positive units that we're placing. So that growth in units is well in excess of normal seasonality, and that does put pressure on kind of the bottom line. Certainly when you look at it sequentially, we're offsetting some of that with great cost improvement.
Dion Weisler: So I would just kind of add to that, Shannon, that the team's incredibly focused on execution. We're taking the cost out of the system so that we can effectively increase our total available market as we go after those NPV positive units. We are leveraging the strongest portfolio we've had in decades. We have real tangible differentiation in security embedded within the products. We have new business models like Instant Ink. And as those costs come out, you've seen over the course of the last 3 quarters the investment that we're making in units. In Q1, if you'll recall, we were down 20% in units. In Q2, we were down 16%. And in Q3, we were down 10%. So a 6-point improvement quarter-over-quarter as those costs come out that we place for units. To answer your second question around PC margins, I would say that our strategy has always been the same here. We're after profitable growth in this business. I think we run a very highly disciplined approach to profitable share expansion. It's about a number of things. It's taking costs out. Costs always have to come out. It's about segmenting the market. It's finding heat in the market today, anticipating where the heat is in the market in the future and skating to the puck and innovating with sprinkles of magic that allow -- enable you to differentiate the product. And so therefore, we choose where we want to play and where we don't want to play. And as a result of that, I think Ron and the team did just an outstanding job this quarter of executing to that strategy. And we yielded sort of the trifecta of growth in revenue, margin expansion and profitable share gain. And I think as a result of that, there's a range of somewhere between 3.5% to 5% that this business will deliver. But what's really important is as revenue declines abate, the negative cash conversion cycle of this business is very attractive.
Shannon Cross: Great. And just really quickly, Cathie. You mentioned Brexit. I'm curious as to what you're thinking about -- if you've seen any impact from Brexit since the announcement?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes. So for Q3, we saw a very, very limited impact from Brexit. And this is largely as a result of the fact that we were largely hedged by the time the Brexit vote actually happened. And so Q3 was really, it was really a nonevent. On a go-forward basis, it's unclear exactly what the impact's going to be. We are definitely seeing, and in some cases, following with our own pricing increases. What's less clear is not so much what the currency impact is and how we adjust to the currency impact, whether it's through hedges or through price increases, it's really what is going to be the impact on demand. What is GDP going to actually do, both in the U.K. and then frankly, if it spreads broader to EMEA. And it's just too early to tell. So we're going to keep, obviously, monitoring this very carefully. And as we get more information and we will share it with you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi.
Jim Suva: On the earlier prepared remarks, you made, I believe, a comment about some shortages in supplies. Can you help us understand that a little bit? Is that like components like, I don't know, semiconductor chips? Or is it like assembly shortages? Because it just seems like there's a bit of a lack of uncertainty in demand in the environment. And I would think any supplier would be very pleased to supply a big company like HP and give them more than their share of components. So can you help us understand that? And then the other part of the question is, your inventory actually went up quarter-over-quarter and it sounds like you're also saying that you may have to build some more inventory due to these component shortages. Was the inventory build this quarter because of that or are they 2 separate things?
Dion Weisler: Okay. Let me tackle the first question. I'll get Cathie to tackle the second. With regards to shortages in supplies, I don't believe in Q3 we saw any material shortages that we had to deal with. However, as you know, these are long supply chains, and we are seeing on the horizon some shortages, particularly around the LCDs, DRAM and flash memory. And it's not so much coming from the PC industry. It's more coming from adjacent categories, glass going into televisions, memory going into phones that are likely to double density, which is putting pressure on the overall industry. We're going to leverage the balance sheet in quarter 4 to ensure that we get our unfair share of supply as we move forward but it is something that we're tracking closely.
Catherine Lesjak: So Jim, to your point, our suppliers are willing to supply HP, and we're taking advantage of that and the strength of our balance sheet to do that in Q4. The increase in days of inventory quarter-on-quarter, the 3-day increase is normal seasonality. So there's nothing particularly unusual about that, whereas we are calling out specifically the fact that days in inventory -- days of inventory will go up in Q4 more than is typical seasonality because of these incremental buys that we're going to make.
Operator: Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
Simona Jankowski: Another PC question, which is, can you comment on how sell-in and sell-through were in the quarter? And then looking into the second half, how do you see demand shaping up for the commercial vertical and Windows 10?
Dion Weisler: So sell-in and sell-through. Sell-in is a function of our revenue, and that's obviously reported. Sell-through and sell-out is in line with our expectations. Channel inventory levels as well as aged inventory levels are well under control as something, as you know, I'm particularly focused on as we operate the Personal Systems business. Broadly speaking, I think the markets will continue to be pressured through the year. We don't broadly disagree with the analysts that predict mid- to high single-digit declines. All -- which will be a little bit worse than calendar quarter 2. However, having said that, I think we have an incredibly strong portfolio of products. Our costs are well under control. And we took a 9-point premium to the market in this quarter in Q3. And so it's that kind of execution, innovation agenda that we have, with the sprinkles of magic that are making a differentiation for our customers is what we're really focused on.
Simona Jankowski: Just to clarify, did you mean that sell-through was above or below sell-in?
Dion Weisler: We did not channel inventory build last quarter.
Operator: Our next question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: There's a little bit of a disconnect between the lowering of the full year EPS guidance and the trifecta that you achieved in PCs and the in-line commentary about printers. So wonder if -- just to start, you can talk about what caused you to believe that the low end of the previous range was more likely? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: Katy, the largest contributor to that was the opportunity to place more incremental NPV-positive printer units. That is what is driving us to the low end. We think that's the exactly right investment to make. And frankly, we could be at the very low end of that if, in fact, we see the Japanese broadly back off of aggressive pricing because that will open up the opportunity. [Audio Gap]
Dion Weisler: As we see that opportunity as we continue to take costs out of business, we want to invest in the future.
Kathryn Huberty: Understood. And then as a follow-up, you mentioned a couple of times both in PCs and printers: device-as-a-service. Is the revenue recognition and accounting impact of those type of deals different than your transactional business? And should we expect, just broadly speaking, any impact to revenue and EPS growth as a result of that go-to-market shift?
Catherine Lesjak: So Katy, it's highly dependent on how the deal is structured and whether or not we partner with another company. So if we actually do a device-as-a-service deal with, let's say, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services, then we don't have real differences in revenue recognition. If we, in fact, hold that same paper ourselves on our books, then yes, there is an impact to revenue recognition. It has -- it's not material at this point in time, but it certainly is, directionally, going to more contractual business. It does -- we'll call it out over time as it becomes material.
Dion Weisler: And don't forget that 80% of our business is conducted with or through the channel. That's -- probably would be closer to 87% through the end of the year. So in many cases, those deals are structured together with the channel.
Operator: And our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Cathie, you mentioned larger TAM because of cost reduction ability on the printers because of your ability to place more NPV-positive units. Can you size this increase in addressable market in terms of how much incremental market share you can target? Or maybe just some sense of how that curve looks where, say, the ability to drive first $20 lower cost opens up like 2 points of share and the next $20 maybe opens up another 2 points. What's a way for us to think about this more numerically?
Catherine Lesjak: Well, I think the best way to think about it is what we said in the last call. We were going to improve our unit declines from Q1 from minus 20% to Q2 to minus 16%. And we told you that in Q3, we were going to get it to low double-digits, improving over minus 16%. In Q4, you should think about it as another step function down because the opportunity seems to be there. We grew units 6% sequentially in Q3 and we expect to be able to do very well sequentially in Q4. We also saw -- we've seen now market share improvements sequentially the last 2 quarters in Q2 and in Q3. And so those are the types of opportunities that are coming up.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. And a follow-up, just any early thoughts on how we should be thinking about cash conversion cycle heading into next year?
Catherine Lesjak: I'm not really prepared to talk about FY '17 just yet. We will have our Security Analyst Meeting and we'll talk a lot about FY '17. But we are very pleased with the progress that we've made from a free cash flow perspective. The cash conversion cycle and the improvement that we've seen in Q3 was a result of kind of broad-based actions that we put in place coming out of Q1 that everybody in this company is very much aware of what free cash flow is and how they can improve it. But it's also, just to give credit where credit's due, we also saw very strong Personal Systems sequential performance, 7.5% growth. And that also contributed pretty significantly to the incremental decline in the cash conversion cycle sequentially.
Operator: And our next question comes from Tony Sacconaghi with Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that you had taken down the supplies channel inventory as anticipated by $225 million, and that you were within your target range for supplies. And can you confirm that? And given that you're going to draw down another $225 million next quarter, will you be below your target range or is that target range dynamic? And when I think about supplies trajectory, I do the same math as you, and on a sell-through basis, it looks like supplies were down about 6% or 6.5%. And last quarter, they were down about 3%. And I think there was inventory build in both Q2 and Q3 last year...
Catherine Lesjak: Hey, Tony. One thing at a time please. I cannot take all the questions that you're putting out on the table. So let's start with the very first one around the channel inventory levels. We were within our target levels exiting Q3, and we did the roughly $225 million worth of channel reduction that we told you we would do with the new sales model for supplies. In terms of if we do another $225 million, will we be below our ranges? We will still be within our ranges but obviously at a much lower level within our ranges. The ranges are not dynamic in the sense of we change them every quarter, kind of at the beginning of the quarter. We set our ranges at the beginning of the year. Now there's some different seasonality quarter-to-quarter, and so the ranges can flux a little bit from quarter-to-quarter depending on seasonality. And you see that in Q4 because you've got more holiday, back-to-school type stuff going on. But we should be -- we'll be in very good position when we take another $225 million out of the channel. Okay. Now what was your next question?
Toni Sacconaghi: Well, just on the dynamic range, though. I thought you had -- when you had your call in June, you had talked about the new omnichannel model and there being a different required inventory level. So that was the reference. Is the -- within your range, that new target range, that is driven by an omnichannel model? Or is that the range that you had talked about in Q2 where you were in line?
Catherine Lesjak: So as we are bringing down channel inventory, we have not made the formal change to our channel inventory levels or ranges. We will do that at the beginning of FY '17 once we get through the actions that we're taking.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay, clear. Yes. On the follow-up. It looks like, as I think you explained on the call, if you adjust for channel inventory and for currency, it looks like supply sell-through was down 6%, 6.5%. Last quarter, it was down 3%. And I appreciate there may have been some channel build in last Q3 but I think there was in Q2 as well. The growth rates were very, very comparable. And so at least, optically, it doesn't feel like the supplies growth rate on a sell-through basis is getting better. At the margin, it actually looks like it's getting worse. Was there anything anomalous about this quarter or last quarter that would explain that? And again, I know you talked about channel inventory build. But again, looking at the reported numbers, it doesn't look like it was really a material difference between Q2 and Q3 last year.
Catherine Lesjak: Right. But last quarter, when we were at about negative 3%, it was adjusting for all of the channel inventory adjustments in the previous year as well as that current quarter. So on a pure apples-to-apples basis, with making all of the same adjustments, currency -- what we call the supplies push-pull or the change in the supplies model and the build in Q3 of '15, which was very significant because of the separation, the model in Q3 says we're down roughly 3% to 4%, which is roughly in line with what we saw last quarter. I also think it is important that our view isn't that it's a linear path from whatever quarter you start out to stabilization. So it's not as if you're going to make progress every single quarter because of the lumpiness with which we place units and didn't place some units at the beginning of the year because there just weren't as many positive NPV units, we are going to see some lumpiness. What's really important is that our Four Box Model is predicting each quarter what we had -- what the results would be and doing it fairly accurately. And so we believe that this model is a good predictor of the future. And it's that model that is ultimately driving our view that there's stabilization in constant currency in supplies revenue by the end of '17.
Operator: And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: Dion, I just wanted to clarify, in an earlier question I think you suggested that you view the PC market as a little bit worse in calendar 3Q versus 2Q. Did I understand that correctly? Because it seems like your PC business was pretty strong this quarter.
Dion Weisler: That was a market statement, not a HP statement. So the IDCs and the Gartners of the world predict that calendar quarter 3 will be weaker than calendar quarter 2. What I then went on to say was even in calendar quarter 2 against a better market, we still took a 9-point premium to the market.
Sherri Scribner: Okay. So you do agree with market expectations that 3Q will be slightly worse than 2Q?
Dion Weisler: Yes, we do.
Sherri Scribner: Okay. And then I just had 2 clarifications. One, it seems like by my math, there's about $5 million of gain left from the sale. Cathie, can you tell me if that's correct? And then also, Cathie, based on your comments for the printer operating margins that suggest margins will be somewhere around the 14% range in the fourth quarter, is that correct?
Catherine Lesjak: Sherri, you got both of those data points exactly right.
Operator: And our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: I was wondering if you can walk me through the reiteration of free cash flow. You say you have a higher inventory buy coming in the fourth quarter. If you look at your GAAP EPS, you've taken that down more than non-GAAP EPS for the year. So are those noncash charges? Or should we expect there to be some cash charges beyond the fourth quarter? And I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So the biggest change to the GAAP outlook is that settlement expense related to the lump-sum offer that we've made to eligible U.S. retirees. So what we did was we've got some U.S. retirees who have chosen to take an annuity in the pension plan. And we went out to them and we offered them a lump-sum buyout. And we got -- we did this about a year ago. We got a fairly good uptick on the ones that are newly eligible. And that has a settlement expense impact of $200 million. That is not a cash impact. And that's the largest change that we made to GAAP versus the changes that we also made on the non-GAAP side. And I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the rest of your question.
Maynard Um: Well, I was just going through the different puts and takes. If you've got a higher inventory buy coming, are there offsets to that, I guess, to keep that free cash flow number?
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't update our free cash flow outlook based on quarterly performance, so we're still in the $2 billion to $2.3 billion, but keep in mind that we've already done $2.2 billion on a year-to-date basis. But in Q4, again, one of the biggest dynamics in Q4, and I can go through all the different puts and takes, but probably the biggest dynamic in Q4 is the fact that the Printing business that has a positive cash conversion cycle is growing sequentially better than normal seasonality. And they declined in -- sequentially in Q3, whereas the Personal Systems business is, in fact, not growing as quickly sequentially and below normal seasonality, and they've got the negative cash conversion cycle. And so it's kind of a double whammy from a cash conversion cycle perspective and cash perspective in Q4. The way we think about the cash conversion cycle is that at the end of Q4, we will have a cash conversion cycle that is several days better than last year's negative 19 days but it will back up from Q3. We don't expect to have another quarter of minus 29 days, again because of this business mix impact and the fact that one of our businesses has a positive cash conversion cycle and is growing. And the one with a negative cash conversion cycle is growing but not as rapidly as it did in Q3.
Maynard Um: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, on the return of cash to shareholders, you talked about being at or above your target for the full year. Are we to just take that comment literally in terms of you not then repurchasing more shares or being less aggressive in those? Or do you feel like there's opportunity for you to be in the market opportunistically to go well above that 50% to 70% target?
Catherine Lesjak: So the comments that we make about the 50% to 75% of our free cash flow are annual comments. And so at this point, given what we've already -- the performance year-to-date in terms of the return of share -- of cash to shareholders as well as the cash flow performance, we expect that we will be at the high end of the 50% to 75% and we may exceed it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: I just want to ask you -- back again on the component pricing environment. As you look at the trends on a forward basis and you increase your inventory levels, are you factoring in any expectations to the negative from a gross margin perspective from component pricing? And what do one of those trends look like in particular so far?
Catherine Lesjak: Aaron, with the leverage of the balance sheet that we are doing and the outlook for pricing, our view is that the component pricing environment doesn't get incrementally more difficult from Q3 to Q4. We're expecting it to be relatively flat with Q3.
Operator: And our last question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: So I wanted to ask again on supply -- this is kind of an esoteric one. But the pound is very weak and I guess, you guys called out that you're going to reprice at some point. And I guess it relates mainly to the U.K. but you can correct that if not. But does that cause people to hoard supplies on printing at all or affect your ability to adjust inventory there? Could you just comment whether that's an issue or not. Or do you have enough transparency into the channel there to avoid that? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So at this point, we're not seeing that impact. I will tell you that the change in the way we go to market on supplies and the lower channel inventory levels, I think, will certainly prevent some of the significant hoarding or pantry effect, which is a nicer way of saying hoarding that we've seen in the past.
Dion Weisler: There's, effectively, no incentive for them to do that. That's exactly why we moved to this demand-driven model in this omnichannel world.
Rod Hall: Okay. It's just if they anticipate price increases, wouldn't that then drive them to potentially engage the pantry effect, as you say, Cathie? I like that term by the way.
Dion Weisler: And obviously, we're monitoring that through very carefully watching the channel inventory level. So...
Rod Hall: Okay. So you just don't see it...
Catherine Lesjak: We won't allow it to happen.
Rod Hall: Right. Okay, okay. And then the other thing I wanted to check is that you made a comment about the Chromebook mix a couple of times. And I just wondered if you could give us a little bit more color on that. Do you think that, that mix shift continues, what's driving it? Just help us understand a little bit more what you're seeing there on the enterprise side.
Dion Weisler: I would say the Chromebook mix is a trend that we do see continuing. It started first in education. I think the chrome have made significant headroom and headway in education. And that is now expanding into some other verticals such as finance and banking. We said a long time ago that we're going to be a multi-OS, multi-architecture organization. So what we need to do is, obviously, establish where the heat is in the market and bring new devices to market. And what we've done with Chromebooks is something a little different to everybody else. We not only have the lower-end cost Chromebooks, but we also have high-end Chromebooks with really attractive Z-hide [ph] ruggedized for education that's helping stabilize some of the pricing. But it is being offset by lower priced Chromebooks that we're delivering as well. So let me thank you all for taking the time to join us on our earnings call here. I'm really confident in our future. We delivered solid progress on our financial commitments. And whilst the markets remain challenged, we know we have more work to do but we're executing to our strategy of core growth and future. We're investing in category-creating opportunities for long-term success. We're almost coming up on the 1-year anniversary; 2 months left in this year to go since the separation. And we're really seeing the value of independence with the ability to run at a greater speed with more agility and more focus. It was absolutely the right thing to do. We're looking forward to seeing all of you at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 13, and thank you again for your attendance.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q2  (2016-05-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2016 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon. I am Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2016. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. And now, I will hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Diana, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our second quarter results. We did what we set out to do. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share were $0.41, above our previously provided outlook range. Free cash flow was strong at $1.5 billion. We took action to improve our cash conversion cycle and are on track to deliver our full year outlook, and we returned more than $0.5 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Amidst difficult market conditions, net revenue was in line with our expectations, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. And in APJ for the second quarter in a row, we delivered constant currency revenue growth, with strength in Personal Systems across much of the region. I will not be completely satisfied with company performance until we return to sustained growth. Delivering our financial commitments is evidence of the solid progress we're making against our strategy to protect our core, deliver on growth and invest in our future. Let me take a moment to remind you of our objectives when we started the year. First, we said the markets were going to be tough for at least several quarters. We are on track to reduce our cost structure by more than $1 billion in FY '16 through productivity initiatives and an acceleration of our 3-year restructuring plan into this year. We executed a number of cost actions, including a reduction of approximately 1,200 headcount year-to-date and are on track to achieve our savings objective by year-end. I continue to believe we have even more opportunity. Second, we said we would be rational in how we price in our core competitive markets. In Q2, we achieved another quarter of sequential ASP improvement in print hardware. While these actions did pressure hardware unit placement, we are starting to see more rational pricing in the market. Third, we said we will continue to shift our portfolio towards strategic and future growth areas. Year-over-year, in Q2, we had constant currency growth in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, commercial services, managed print services and graphics printing solutions. And we just launched our first 3D systems, which I will cover shortly. A key to success in competitive markets is product differentiation and innovation. It's thrilling to see the innovation coming out of HP supporting our core growth and future initiatives. We are reinventing our business and our technologies so that industries and individuals can reinvent what matters most. Let me share some examples of incredible innovation this quarter. We launched a robust business printing lineup with more than 15 new PageWide OfficeJet Pro and JetIntelligence LaserJet printers. This launch included an incredible innovation in productivity and supported our objective to reshape the installed base towards units with higher supplies usage. As the industry continues to shift from transactional to contractual sales, HP and our partners are differentiated with our secure Managed Print Services offering. At a time when security is essential to customers, HP has the strongest security protection available in the industry. In our graphics business, Drupa, the Olympics of graphics, is just 1 week away, and we are planning several exciting announcements. Among others, we are expanding our packaging portfolio to address customer needs as they shift to digital, and we are enhancing our commercial graphics printers with image quality and productivity simply unmatched in the industry. And just last week, we delivered the world's first production-ready commercial 3D printing system, marking a major step forward towards igniting what could be the next industrial revolution. I'm really proud of this announcement, which we made with some significant ecosystem partners, including Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Siemens, among others. The new HP Jet Fusion 3D printing solutions produce superior physical parts up to 10x faster and at half the cost of current 3D printing systems. Our products deliver the speed, cost and quality and economics that will help democratize manufacturing and help deliver mass customization. These systems leverage decades of HP's R&D print expertise and thousands of patents from our core. We are building a whole new partner channel for 3D printing and we'll continue to grow our ecosystem of co-development and technology partners in powerful industries like automotive, aerospace, medical and consumer goods. In Personal Systems, we continue to deliver design and engineering in the consumer premium segment, including our most recent announcements of the HP Spectre, the world's thinnest laptop. We introduced this beautiful product at The New York Times Luxury show in Paris to rave reviews. We grew double-digits year-over-year in this profitable segment while the broader consumer premium market declined. Among other highlights in Personal Systems. We reinvented the Chromebook to be ultrathin for home and office and announced it with Google earlier in April. Commanding a higher-selling price, this modern, thin and light device offers quick boot time, simple navigation and syncing, multilayered security and the ability to share and access information anywhere. It's also the first to use a 6th generation Intel Core M Processor. With our superior product lineup, we continue to grow our reputation and competitive position. Some of our major logo wins include Eli Lilly, GM and PricewaterhouseCoopers. I'll shift now to provide color on the segment results. In Personal Systems, we executed well against a challenging market backdrop. We continue to make progress on our strategy to deliver profitable share gains, while gaining momentum in key growth markets. In the core, we outperformed the PC market once again. We extended our worldwide commercial leadership to a new all-time-high share position of 24.6% with meaningful year-over-year share gains in all 3 regions. We maintained our #1 share position in worldwide desktop stations at 45.6% and grew our #1 share in mobile workstations to 38.9%. And beyond the core, we delivered constant currency year-over-year growth in strategic areas such as detachables, commercial services and consumer displays, all very profitable businesses. Personal Systems' operating profit improved to 3.5% with year-over-year growth in operating profit dollars. A key commercial customer win came with Deutsche Post DHL Group, the world's leading logistics service group. The deal included a broad range of commercial products, including EliteBooks, x2 tablets, Chromebooks and Displays. Now turning to Printing. In line with our expectations, the year-over-year revenue decline continued, but was approximately flat sequentially. In addition to demand weakness, we faced currency headwinds of about 6 points year-over-year. We said we needed to focus on operational improvements in the core business to support stability in supplies revenue. And in Q2, all elements of the supplies Four Box Model performed largely as expected. Specifically, on hardware units, we pulled back on discounts. This resulted in an increase in constant currency ASPs, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And as I mentioned earlier, these actions did pressure total unit sales. However, our cost actions enabled us to place additional positive MPV units. As a result, we grew 2 points of share sequentially in calendar first quarter in both ink and laser hardware. As I always say, not all hardware is created equally. The quality of the installed base is important. Over time, we are working to shift the installed base to units with higher supplies usage. We saw double-digit unit growth in PageWide print hardware, while gaining share in value multifunction laser printers. Also, we continued to execute on our initiatives to win back aftermarket supply share. We started to see progress and expect continued momentum in the coming quarters. Instant Ink, our subscription-based delivery service had another quarter of sequential enrollee growth and high retention rates. Let me also highlight that we made this progress while reducing hardware and supplies channel inventory globally. We are now within our targeted ranges. And given our progress, we still expect our supplies revenue trajectory in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. Beyond the core, we have solid momentum in our growth categories. In graphics, we delivered the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth, supported by strength in large format design, production and services. The terrific win was with Staples, where we supported their entire graphic solutions business with technologies ranging from DesignJet graphics to Latex to Scitex flatbed systems. This is another major expansion of the graphics wide format relationship and symbolic of our leadership in service delivery. Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to reinforce that this was a strong quarter for HP, where we delivered solid progress towards our strategy in the core, growth and future markets. Despite a tough market, we delivered on our objectives, unleashed truly amazing innovations and grew in strategic areas of our business. I am confident in our ability to execute and remain committed to long-term growth. I'll now hand it over to Cathie, who will share additional details, including our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Q2 results were solid and in line operationally with our expectations. Net revenue was $11.6 billion, down 11% year-over-year as reported or down 5% in constant currency. Gross margin of 19.4% was down 0.3 points year-over-year, driven by unfavorable currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by cost improvements and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.7 points quarter-over-quarter largely in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.3 billion were down 16% year-over-year, primarily in SG&A. As a reminder, due to the use of discontinued operations basis of accounting, some historical expenses, primarily in admin, were fully allocated to the parent company, which was  HP Inc. in the U.S. Also in Q2 '16, we recorded a gain in SG&A from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets. Further, we had year-over-year savings from reduction in our overall cost structure. Non-GAAP OI&E was a net expense of $13 million, lower-than-normal run rate due to a onetime benefit from a legal settlement benefiting net EPS by about $0.03. Although timing was unknown when we set our FY '16 annual financial plan, the settlement was modeled in our full-year earnings outlook and was fully booked in Q2. With a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.7 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41. GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.38, primarily excluded restructuring charges of $100 million, only partially offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million. Non-GAAP results also excluded an $8 million net tax indemnification credit related to the tax matters agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise company. We expect that certain tax matters and the related indemnification effect will continue to change each quarter and will be recorded as adjustments in GAAP-only results. Now turning to the segments. Personal Systems' net revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year-over-year or down 5% in constant currency. Consumer revenue was down 16%, while commercial revenue was down 7% year-over-year as reported. While we outperformed the market overall, we did especially well in the commercial segment with improvement in the year-over-year revenue decline. Innovations across the portfolio have been well received by customers. We are very excited about the great momentum of the Elite x2 commercial mobility product, which had solid initial sales and has a very strong sales pipeline. As a result of our focus on growth opportunities beyond the core, we increased constant currency year-over-year revenue in commercial notebooks, commercial mobility, consumer premium and gaming. Personal Systems ASPs were down slightly year-over-year, but improved sequentially due to favorable mix, partially offset by highly competitive pricing. Personal Systems' operating profit was 3.5%, up 0.6 points year-over-year, driven by improved gross margin rate. Also, we reduced operating expenses as compared to last year, but not in line with revenue decline. Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $4.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year or down 10% in constant currency. Hardware units were down slightly sequentially, but better than normal seasonality as our cost actions increased the number of units that were now at a positive MPV. Approximately 11 points of the 16% year-over-year unit decline were related to the market. The remainder was largely associated with our pricing discipline and focus on only positive MPV unit placement. We are very pleased with our refreshed product portfolio, which will support our hardware strategy to price on differentiated value and to ensure strong HP original supplies attach. Supplies revenue was down 16% year-over-year as reported or down 10% in constant currency. Considering currency and the channel inventory position, the supplies revenue trajectory has improved. We reduced channel inventory in the quarter, which was a 7-point headwind as compared to the prior-year period. In Q2, supplies revenue mix was 67% flat sequentially and channel inventory was within our targeted range. Operating profit for Printing was 17.3%, down 0.5 points year-over-year, driven by currency and competitive pricing, partially offset by operational improvements, favorable hardware mix and divestiture gains. The gain from the sale of certain marketing optimization software assets, helped to offset the incremental placement of hardware units and the reduction of supplies inventory in the quarter. Now to an update on the restructuring activities we announced at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall. Over 800 people exited the company in Q2 and approximately 1,200 year-to-date. The acceleration of the restructuring activities is on track, and we still expect approximately 3,000 people to exit by the end of the year. As Dion said, we are continuously seeking efficiencies and we believe there are incremental actions to take beyond this fiscal year. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Cash flow from operations was approximately $1.6 billion and free cash flow was approximately $1.5 billion. The cash conversion cycle was negative 24 days, a 9-day sequential improvement, driven by a 6-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 3-day decrease in days of inventory. I'm extremely pleased with the operational rigor of the entire organization and all the working capital metrics. We still expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Our expected seasonality would suggest Q4 to be a stronger cash flow quarter than Q3. During the second quarter, we repurchased 28.7 million shares and paid $213 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $518 million. Given where we are year-to-date, we will clearly achieve and may exceed the high end of our original 50% to 75% target range of returning free cash flow to shareholders for the full year. Looking ahead, there are a few assumptions we made in our financial outlook for the remainder of the year. We expect year-over-year revenue declines to moderate for Personal Systems and Printing. Also, in Printing, the progress we are making on our cost structure as well as some price discipline gives us the opportunity to place more units. Hardware unit declines will moderate, although we still expect low double-digit declines year-over-year. Supplies revenue in constant currency will continue to decline, but it's still expected to stabilize by the end of 2017. Productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring actions across the company are expected to improve overall profitability as compared to the first half of the year. With all that in mind, Q3 '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $0.37 to $0.40. Q3 '16 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.59 to $1.65. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations is in the range of $1.52 to $1.58. With that let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, how should we think about the yen influence on Printing margins through the remainder of the year?
Catherine Lesjak: So thanks, Shannon (sic) [ Katy ]. From a -- from the yen benefit perspective, we do expect a little bit of a benefit. We saw a little bit in Q2 as well, but that benefit is significantly coming down as the yen has appreciated a bit.
Kathryn Huberty: And then as you think about PCs in the back half, maybe Dion, we are hearing from distributors that inventories have come down. You seem to cite that as well. Would you expect a meaningful improvement in unit growth as we go into the back half of the year?
Dion Weisler: And Katy, was that for Printing or Personal Systems?
Kathryn Huberty: For PCs.
Dion Weisler: For PCs, I would say that we have consistently remained very vigilant in our control over inventory. I think it's a mixed bag in terms of inventory out in the channel. There are some vendors that still have high levels of inventory and in some where inventory has come down. I think all of it points to sort of broadly speaking, we don't largely disagree with what the major analysts are predicting for the second half of the year that whilst the markets will continue to be pressured, it will abate somewhat in the second half of the year. Our inventory is well in control and so is our aged inventory, 2 very important metrics that we watch very closely.
Catherine Lesjak: And Katy, sorry about that. I'm so used to Shannon asking the questions about the yen.
Kathryn Huberty: It's okay.
Catherine Lesjak: I went immediately to Shannon, I apologize.
Kathryn Huberty: It's okay.
Operator: The next question is from Rod Hall at JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: So my question, I guess, it's along similar lines but broader that you guys have such a broad impact and kind of an outsized impact from currency, especially from the strong dollar. And it looks like the interest rate [indiscernible]  most people are expecting [indiscernible]. How stress-tested is your earnings guidance for the full year against a stronger dollar? What sort of assumptions are you making? Could you just give us some idea on that?
Catherine Lesjak: Well, it -- Rod, if you actually look at where currencies are today, they're not that different than where we started the beginning of the year when we provided our first outlook. On top of that, we obviously put hedges in over time. And so we believe -- we feel pretty confident in our outlook given where the dollar is now, even if it were to get a little bit stronger.
Rod Hall: Okay. So you assume a little bit of an interest rate rise, but not much more than that, Cathie. Is that correct?
Catherine Lesjak: So I look at it more from a currency perspective. I understand it's the interest rate rise drives the currency, so we look at it more and we've modeled the different levels of the dollar.
Rod Hall: And can I ask to you one follow-up, which is your interest expense was quite a bit lower than last quarter. I just wonder if you could give us any color on what drove that?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. The biggest difference wasn't interest rates, it was this legal settlement that we had that benefited EPS by about $0.03. That was -- it showed primarily up in OI&E.
Operator: The next question is from James Kisner at Jefferies LLC.
James Kisner: I just want to clarify your comments in supplies. I believe you said that while the decline was worse year-over-year, it had a pretty significant headwind from inventory adjustments. And I'm just kind of wondering if you could talk about how that impact from inventory affected last quarter's constant currency growth. And just in general, what kind of market decline you were modeling for supplies or assuming for supply -- the supplies market to stabilize the revenue by the end of '17?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think the way to think about this is probably to go back to the Four Box Model and how we think about supplies in terms of us being on the trajectory that leads to stabilization in constant currency supplies revenue by the end of '17. And I believe Dion said it in his prepared remarks that when we started the quarter, we have an expectation of what the Four Box -- the different elements of the Four Box Model are going to do, and then -- based on the models that we have. And then we look at the end of the quarter to see how they responded in actuality. And they were largely in line with what we were expecting. And that says that our model is predicting in the quarter -- within a quarter, is doing a good job of predicting what's going to happen to supplies. So we are on track with that. In terms of the channel inventory correction, off the top of the -- my head, I don't remember what the impact was last quarter. We did have some -- we definitely had some channel inventory corrections last quarter as well, but this quarter was larger and it was 7 points of the headwind. So if you look at the -- if you look at this, you look at supplies growth of -- or decline of about 16%, you take off about 6 points of currency, 7 points of channel inventory. If you look at kind of the real demand, it's basically down about 3%, again, in line with what we were expecting.
Dion Weisler: And just to give you my perspective on this, what I'm most happy about is we did exactly what we said we would do. And what has happened in the market and what we thought would happen in the market has actually transpired. We said we needed to adjust to what I call the new normal, and that was a sort of combination of further market contraction that was driving an increased competitive price market. We said that we saw weakness in emerging markets and we did indeed see that continue. Currency continued as a headwind and that we were expecting tough macroeconomic conditions worldwide. We actually adapted to this new normal. And you'll remember on our fourth quarter earning call and our first quarter earning call, we talked about having to not only deliver on the $1 billion of productivity improvements, but actually that wasn't going to be enough and that we were going to need to do more. And we are on track to doing more than our $1 billion. We also said that we needed to accelerate our restructuring. And in Cathie's prepared remarks, she said we are also on track to doing that, and that we needed to persist with our efforts to drive price stability in the market. So all of that is actually working out. Supplies trajectory improved, but it was somewhat masked by the channel inventory reductions that we had. Supplies inventory is now back within the ranges globally, and that's obviously where we want it to be. So we -- with all of those productivity improvements, continue to reshape the installed base, we're focusing on high-value units. That's evidenced through the continued growth in value multifunction laser. We said we needed to continue to refresh the product lineup. We did that 15 new devices launched last quarter, JetIntelligence, PageWide Array and OfficeJet Pro. And we said we needed to continue to grow in our graphics business and we did for the 11th consecutive quarter in a row as we did with Instant Ink. So as Cathie mentioned, all of that translates to what we're seeing transpire as we planned it out to be. And therefore, with all of that, we expect to stabilize our supplies revenue trajectory by the end of FY -- by the end of '17.
James Kisner: Quick follow-up on that. I mean, it sounds like you're on track from your restructuring and your supplies growth long term. So I guess wondering why you're lowering the higher end of guidance here.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes. So what happened in Q2 and what we are expecting will be true in Q3 and Q4 as well, is that with the cost reductions that we've made, we actually have, in effect, opened up more positive MPV TAM in printer units. So we took advantage of that in Q2, and we gained 2 points of share sequentially while maintaining our price rationality. And we expect that in the back half of the year, we will also be able to take advantage of placing additional units, which is, from my perspective and Dion's perspective, the right thing to do for the business to maximize the area under the curve. And so that took the top end of our previous guidance down a bit, but for the long-term value for the company.
Operator: Your next the question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Adrienne Colby: Adrienne Colby for Sherri. I was hoping you could update us on your expectations for the cash conversion cycle. You obviously, saw some impressive improvement, but how should we think about working capital over the balance for the year?
Dion Weisler: Well, let me just say that I was very pleased with the improvements in each of the cash conversion metrics that we closely track and monitor. Our goal was, as you remember, to reduce our cash conversion cycle by several days from our quarter 1 exit. We got there plus a little bit more. And this was an actually an enormous enterprise-wide effort, and we've made some permanent changes to our processes and to our business management system. I think the team rallied exceptionally well together to focus on all the levers that we have available to us. So we expect to exit FY '16 with the cash conversion cycle several days improved over FY '15. And that will enable us to achieve our full year free cash flow outlook of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion for the full year.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Cathie, you talked about the legal gain helping $0.03. You also mentioned that there was a gain on sales of marketing optimization software. How big was that? And that -- was that completely captured in the Imaging -- Printing and Imaging Group? And I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, Toni. It was completely captured within the Printing OP. And while we're not specifically sizing it, I think what we did was we used that opportunity to fund the incremental unit placements that we had as a result of cost reductions that we've done. We placed more units. We were able to gain that share I mentioned. And then, we also -- we took our channel -- our supplies channel inventory levels down even a bit further than what we had originally intended because we believe that managing -- having a tight handle on the channel inventory levels is good for our business.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And just a follow-up, I mean, it sounds like you're saying you're going to invest in trying to take more share, yet you also said to expect double-digit declines in units for the remainder of the year. And I know I probably asked some form of this question every call, but 100% of your profits are driven by supplies. And your assertion that supplies should stabilize next year is still not transparent to me. And so if we look at last 5  quarters, hardware revenue has been down double digits. Hardware revenue has been down 19 out of the last 20 quarters. So if I'm looking at that box in the Four Box Model that says, what's happening to my installed base, it's down, and it's probably down mid-single digits. So to stabilize, what's the key thing that changes? Are you expecting much better capture rate on reman? Are you expecting people to start printing more given their printers? But the only thing that we really see is what's happening to your installed base, and that's declining. So I appreciate that your model tells you and it's been accurate, but it would be really helpful if we could understand what you think happens in the model to go from what's been closer to mid-single digit declines in supplies to 0 given the backdrop that we see, which is hardware units continues to be negative.
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, really, what I said was that the printer unit declines would be low double digits in Q3. Q3 is a relatively tough compare, because if you will remember last year, we did some incremental what we called insurance policy because of the split that we were going through. So it is a tough compare. But we went from minus 20% declines in Q1 to minus 16%, and then it's going to come down further as well in Q3 of '16. And I think what's important is that we've captured -- it's not like this is a surprise to us. We've captured it within the modeling that we have done. Our models are holding up and our models basically show that supplies revenue in constant currency will stabilize by the end of '17.
Dion Weisler: And I think, Toni, what you're really highlighting here is the complexity of the business. And there is no single magic pill that changes the supplies trajectory. So what we need to do is to continue to focus on all areas of the Four Box Model, the installed base being one metric. But remember that the installed base is a function of every kind of category and segment of business that we do, from those printers that produce less supplies to those that produce a lot of supplies. And we are placing more MPV-positive units enabled by the costs that we're taking out of the business. And we're innovating and we're introducing new products and new series of printers that are really very much focused on the business side of the ledger. And these new platforms generally come with higher supplies attach because the aftermarket alternatives have not yet made their way into the market. Usage is another part of the Four Box Model. Not all printers are created equally. And even the same printer placed in a different location or a different ZIP code produce a different amount of supplies. So reshaping that installed base to higher-usage of printers is kind of job number one. The other major shift that's happening is the move from transactional to contractual, and as that shift happens, we move to 100% supplies attach. And the final area in terms of usage is the work we're doing around marketing to stimulate printing demand. We're shifting our marketing efforts from marketing printers to marketing printing. And that sort of takes care of box number two. On the third box, the aftermarket share, you have these newer platforms that come with higher attach. You've got work we're doing around the omni-channel. It's very comprehensive, covering online coverage in marketing as well as the innovation that we're driving our ink formulas and new toner technology resulting in a much better printed page when you're using original HP supplies. And the fourth lever, of course, is pricing which remains flat and consistent with our expectations. So all these factors drive supplies consumption, not just the installed base. And the model would suggest that we are on track to that stabilization by the end of '17 in constant currency.
Catherine Lesjak: And we have initiatives in every one of those boxes.
Operator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Dion, you mentioned more rational pricing. How much do you attribute to the recent moves in the yen? Are you seeing any difference in the competitive behavior? And I have a follow-up.
Dion Weisler: Well, I think it's a little hard to speculate because I don't necessarily understand the hedging strategies of each of our Japanese competitors. I would say in the long term, if the yen remains where it is, that ultimately is good news for us. But I think we've been very disciplined in the market in terms of not dragging the market down in price, selling the value of our products shifting away from spending contra-dollars on discounting to marketing and sales, and that's resulted in higher ASPs. So we're very focused on our activities. And I think we're starting to see some signs of market stabilization.
Wamsi Mohan: Okay. Great. And as my follow-up. It sounds like you regained some share in the aftermarket supplies. Can you talk about where that was, how much it was, whether it was commercial or consumer? And was it like related primarily to the new printer introductions in the quarter?
Catherine Lesjak: So I don't believe that we've made any statements specifically about aftermarket share for supplies improving. Now, we are -- as part of going after the Four Box Model, we are working on increasing our aftermarket supply share. And we're starting to make some progress specifically in the omni-channel space, which is what Dion mentioned, I believe, in his prepared remarks.
Dion Weisler: So I think I would expect that aftermarket share would come up as we release these newer platforms, those newer platforms come with almost 100% supplies attach. I would expect our aftermarket share as we move from transactional to contractual, where that comes with 100% supplies attach, to drive up our aftermarket share. I would expect the work we're doing around omni-channel, as Cathie mentioned, which is some very comprehensive work around online coverage and marketing to also improve our aftermarket share and the innovation that we're driving in ink formulas and toner would also do that.
Operator: The next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: I have a question that looks out a little bit further. You have a number of drivers in 2017, including 3D printing, the A3 market, a number of new other products. But can you help us identify what the mile markers are to judge success? I mean, what should we be looking for as we enter 2017 that points us to this materializing as growth drivers for you? And how long does it take for these products to ramp to a level that's material enough that it can actually have an impact on revenue and profit? Is it 2, 3 quarters?
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Maynard. So let me say that everything we've spoken about so far has really been focused on the core, and we're really incredibly focused on our traditional franchises of Print and Personal Systems. But as part of our overall strategy for the company, we do have certain growth areas that are incredibly important to us. You mentioned a couple of them. Our A3 product work remains on track, and our portfolio will come out towards the middle of next year. That is on time and on track and we're doing a lot of work around preparing, not only for the products, but for the go-to-market that is required in order to be successful in this marketplace. Another part of our growth engine is graphics. Graphics grew for the 11th consecutive quarter, and we're just about to walk into Drupa next week, which is the Olympics of the graphics business. It happens every 4 years and we're very excited about some of the products that we will be announcing at Drupa. And the third area is commercial mobility, and our commercial mobility practice continues to grow. We're excited by the work we're doing there. We made some really interesting category creating product announcements with the Elite x3 during the course of the quarter at Mobile World Congress to rave reviews. So lots of positive signals from the market from a product respective and the pipeline that we're building. And then, of course, only last week, we announced our 3D printing products. And we have really breakthrough innovation here, solving the problems of speed, quality and cost. We said we would release them in the second half of this year. And a proof point of that is the announcements that we made last week. And the strategic announcements that we made with Nike, with BMW, with Johnson & Johnson and Jabil, a very important player in this space. So I think there's a lot of markers out there that point to the execution of this team. We do what we say we're going to do, whether it's product, whether it's go-to-market or business model readiness.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Suva at Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Congratulations to you and your team there at HP. I have one question for Dion and one for Cathie, so I'll just pass them both at the same time. First, for Dion, your sister company, HP Enterprise, last night announced that they're -- they'd break out part of their business, naming the -- namely the services. Have you considered splitting up or would you? And does that actually make any sense? And then for Cathie, the operating profit margins in Printing, I believe was down year-over-year and I think you'd mentioned the litigation helped that. So it would have been down even more year-over-year. Is the correct way to think about it is to stabilize it? Is it top line? Is it mix? Is it cost cutting? And how should we think about stabilizing the operating margins of the Printing business that is so profitable for your company?
Dion Weisler: Well, thank you, Jim, and thank you for the congratulations. And first, let me extend my congratulations to Meg and the Hewlett Packard Enterprise team on a spectacular earnings, and on a very successful announcement of the spin merger they're doing with CSC. I think what that demonstrates is that the separation and the focus of the organizations on the markets that are moving at top speed is really working. It's produced better results for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. It's producing solid results for us as well as fueling the innovation engines of both companies. So I don't want to comment much further on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's announcement, but I will say that we are really committed to the long-term success of HP. I'm very happy with the assets that we have in both Printing and Personal Systems. They're both an important -- play a very important role within our portfolio as the sort of broad things. We obviously always continue to look and reevaluate the markets as they change and measure all of our assets relative to the strategy and sometimes that results in a divestiture, and we made a divestiture this quarter and some marketing optimization assets. That's an ongoing process. But as far as our major franchises go, we're very committed to both portfolios.
Catherine Lesjak: Operating profit [indiscernible] down 50 basis points as you mentioned, and that's really driven by currency and the very competitive pricing environment we saw. It was partially offset by the productivity initiatives that we've got and the broader non-revenue-generating cost reductions as well as the favorable hardware mix. And then we had some benefit from the divestiture gains. It wasn't litigation, it was divestiture of the marketing optimization assets. But as I told you, we made the conscious decision to invest that gain back into placing incremental MPV-positive units. And you can see the impact of that, frankly, in the share gains that we had quarter-on-quarter as well as basically bringing our channel inventory levels for supplies in a bit more. From a quarter-on-quarter perspective, the increase was really driven by cost improvements as well as the divestiture gain and that was partially offset by competitive pricing, currency and some investments that we made in go-to-market and R&D.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross at Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Dion, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the 3D printing initiative from your standpoint. I'm curious what sort of feedback you've heard from beta customers, some of the partners. How are you thinking about this initiative over the next year or 2? And then I have a follow-up.
Dion Weisler: I'm super excited by it. I think the feedback from potential channel partners, from end customers and from analysts and those that follow the industry closely, understand what a breathtaking breakthrough we've made towards really pulling 3D printing into the mainstream. We released the first production -- short run production 3D printing systems. They're 10x faster than other products that are out on the marketplace, unbelievable quality and most importantly, at half the cost. And when you get those 3 things right, you start to tap into specific applications that are better to be done by digital 3D printing than they are in an analog fashion. And the best example I can give you is our 3D printers themselves. 50% of the bill of materials of our 3D printers are printed by our 3D printers, so our printers are printing themselves. And it's a perfect example in short run manufacturing of the great business case. We're not doing this to make a point. We're doing this because it's more economically advantageous to us to print these products in 3D than it is to use traditional manufacturing. So we're very bullish. We have a long and complex, and I like complexity here, roadmap. This is not easy to duplicate. We're leveraging more than 5,000 patents from our core, leveraging 30 years of innovation that we've had in our Printing business. And we're bringing it to bear into a market that really hasn't had a very large mainstream player with the brand that HP has and reputation that we have. So we're really excited by the market. We're happy with the ramp we're doing on our partners and our certified channel partners. We're incredibly excited by really impressive ecosystem co-innovators with us, Nike, BMW, Johnson & Johnson, Siemens, Jabil. The list goes on, both in the materials as well as end customers.
Shannon Cross: Great. And then my second question's just on PCs. I'm curious what kind of trends you're seeing. How you're thinking about the market? Clearly, it's been pretty weak. And how you're also thinking about some of these future products like the x3 and leveraging continuum, because it sort of a -- it's not a phone, it's not a computer. How do you see this market developing both near term and then in the next couple of years with some of these new technologies?
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, we're not surprised by the PC market. I think we were one of the earliest to predict that these markets will continue to be challenged for quite some time. And as a result of that, we needed to just take immediate action to get our costs in line with where the markets were. But over the long term, we sort of genuinely broadly agree with the analysts and where they expect things to land. We see continued declines in calendar quarter 2. The market is projecting that it will improve in calendar quarter 3 and 4, and we tend to disagree. Now whether it's low single digits or mid-single digits, I guess, that's up for debate and no one's is perfect at making those predictions. But I think things are getting better. To your sort of second point on some of these new categories, I think as the technology improves as we're able to fit more power into smaller platforms, we get to have this continuous evolution of the continuum all the way from mobile up to workstation. And these lines are beginning to blur and that enables us to create new products and new categories like Elite x3. That technology is not going to slow down. It's only going to accelerate. So I think we've got to start looking as an industry at the entire spectrum, all the way from phones to workstations. Think about that market. Think about how those hard lines were characterized in the past and how those hard lines will begin to break down in the future. And as leaders, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, whether that be the success we're having with our x2 or the new category trend in products like x3. It's all about changing that continuum. So we continue to have a very highly disciplined approach to this business. We segment, we segment again. We navigate the heat in the market and we predict where we think the heat's going to be. We're constantly challenging ourselves on price, function, value for our customers. We're always taking costs out of the system and we have to be a massive innovator, and I think we're doing all of that as well.
Diana Sroka: Thank you, Shannon. I think we have time for one more question, please?
Operator: Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: Just a couple of clarifications for me. In terms of the supplies, I understand as you've said many times today and before, this is going to stabilize by the end of '17. But specifically, Cathie or Dion, the year-over-year decline 10% constant currency this quarter, does that year-over-year decline stack better from here given the lower channel inventories that you talked about and the initiatives you put into place? Or could it be uneven for the next few quarters? Just I'm trying to understand whether things -- just the decline gets a little bit easier. And then on free cash flow, was there anything onetime in nature that drove that free cash flow number this quarter that helped you?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Kulbinder. On the supplies, I think the right way to think about it is a 16% decline in supplies revenue. The fact that there was 6 points of currency, so you're down to -- down 10% constant currency, but you've got 7 points of channel inventory correction that, our belief is, you don't continue to correct channel inventory on a go-forward basis. So really, when you're looking at, I guess, we sometimes refer to as real supplies growth or decline, we're at about minus 3. And we -- obviously, as we go through '17, we expect that, that will continue to improve so that it stabilizes by the end of '17, but again, largely in line with what we expected. And then from a free cash flow perspective, a couple of things. First off, where we saw particularly strong performance was in the cash conversion cycle. If you look back to Q1, our cash conversion cycle was minus 15 days and we're now at minus 24. And we basically hit on every one of those metrics. Dion mentioned it. It was a company-wide initiative in which we educated and helped people become even more conscious about cash flow. We enlisted the help of our sales reps in getting collections done. It was an incredible team effort and something in many ways we've instituted now kind of permanent changes and permanent initiatives around that free cash flow and the cash conversion cycle. I also just really briefly want to mention the fact that it -- our free cash flow, on a year-to-date basis, also includes about $170 million of separation cash outflows, which obviously, are one -- more onetime in nature.
Dion Weisler: Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope you will agree, we delivered really solid results here and we did exactly what we said we would do, and that's important to us as a leadership team. We do know how to execute regardless of market conditions. We don't stick our head in the sands here. We understand what's going on in the market and how to adjust our organization accordingly. We're delivering on our financial commitments. We've made solid progress. More work to do. We're executing across core growth and the future and lots of proof points there. We're shifting to higher-margin growth product segments and we're setting this company up for long-term success. So thank you very much.
Operator: Conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2016 Q1  (2016-02-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 HP Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Denise, and I will be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon. I'm Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the Fiscal 2016 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call with Dion Weisler, HP's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Dion, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the accompanying slide presentation on our Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see disclaimers in the earnings materials relating to the forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports including our most recent Form 10-K.  HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2016. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we've included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release. With that, I'll hand it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Diana. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for dialing in today. We've completed the first quarter as HP Inc. And while we continued to face macroeconomic and market headwinds, we are executing to the plan we laid out at our Security Analysts Meeting last September. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to shareholders through our planned quarterly dividend and aggressive share buybacks, taking advantage of the stock price. And while revenue continued to be challenged by market contraction in PCs and core printing, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in APJ and in strategic growth segments of the portfolio, including commercial mobility, retail solutions, graphics and services. Cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations, driven by changes in working capital, which was impacted by lower personal systems volume. We've taken immediate actions to stay on track to deliver our full year commitment. Cathie will walk you through those details in just a few minutes. As you consider our financial performance for the quarter, remember that we operate in mature markets. This is an environment where we know how to win, gain share and out execute our competitors. A key driver of success in competitive markets is product innovation and differentiation. Innovation is the lifeblood of HP. This year at CES, we had an outstanding show of new products and took home more than a dozen awards for products like the EliteBook Folio, the world's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook. Demonstrating the consumerization of IT, we took best of show for a business-class product because it has the rugged features needed for mobile workers, but the sleek and stylish design that, "Let's face it, we all want." As the global commercial PC leader, it's incumbent on us to reinvent what the category is capable of, and it's exciting to see the market's reaction to our progress. Earlier this week, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced the HP Elite x3, a revolutionary category-creating mobile solution that brings together mobility and computing in a truly meaningful way. Some in the industry are calling it a new standard for commercial mobility. Running the Windows 10 mobile platform, the HP Elite x3 unites phablet, laptop and desktop experiences into a single device.  Along with its accessories, it's truly the one device that's every device, enabling users to scale from simple texting to spreadsheets and PowerPoint to utilizing corporate applications. With our strong channel partners and the latest advancements from Microsoft, Qualcomm and Salesforce, we are turning the promise of mobile productivity into reality for our business customers. In printing, we launched the PageWide Excel product in our graphics portfolio for our initial entry in the technical production market. These fast, large-format mono and color printers are expected to disrupt a $1 billion market and achieve a leading share position. Targeting the SMB segment in emerging markets, we launched the DeskJet GT, a continuous ink-supply system printer, to meet the needs of these high-usage customers. In the coming months, you can expect to see a refresh of inkjet products and the completion of the jet intelligence laser portfolio, Refresh. We are also planning to make other strategic announcements around 3D printing. Our product portfolio across the board is our best ever, and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities as the markets steadily improve. Before I go into business performance, let me remind you of our objectives going in the quarter. First, in addition to continuing to solution the productivity initiatives shared at SAM last September on our Q4 earnings call, we said we would materially change our nonrevenue-generating cost structure to allow us to compete more effectively in these competitive markets. Not only are the $1 billion of productivity initiatives on track, but we are accelerating the restructuring program, also announced at SAM, by increasing the fiscal '16 employee reductions to approximately 3,000. I believe there may be even more opportunity to reduce cost and streamline processes, and we will share details when finalized. Second, we said we would balance our pricing actions with marketing and sales activity to both stimulate demand, to drive price stability the market. The outcome for printing hardware was a sequential increase in ASPs overall. And while this approach also contributed significantly to the unit decline, our working assumption is that this will ultimately result in an improved competitive environment. And in Personal Systems, we said we will continue to shift our mix to the high end and walk away from negative margin business. During the quarter, the team executed this strategy very well, offsetting headwinds and maintaining ASPs and flat gross margin year-over-year. Lastly, we said we would invest in strategic growth initiatives beyond the core, and we've made solid progress in areas such as commercial mobility and graphics. And our plans are on track for 3D and A3. Now turning to the segments. We saw mixed results across the portfolio. Starting with Personal Systems, I am pleased with our performance as we outgrew the market profitably and maintained our #1 position in commercial, with an all-time high share of 24% in calendar fourth quarter of 2015. We held our strong leadership position in workstations with almost 42% share and regain the #1 spot in mobile workstations. The overall PC market was slower to recover than expected, but we continued to execute, manage our channel inventory and improve product mix. We both defended our existing business and won new opportunities from incumbents. For example, we closed a large U.K. public sector contract, retaining desktop product business and beating all the key competitors. And we won back significant business with one of the world's largest multinational banking and financial service firms with our commercial EliteBook. Just as importantly, we made progress on our key growth initiatives beyond the core. Commercial mobility, which includes tablets and detachables, grew strong double digits year-over-year, and we are seeing continued momentum with the recent launch of the Elite x2 detachable. Turning to printing. In quarter 1, many of the challenges we discussed on the Q4 earnings call continued as expected. Let me remind you of the competitive advantage the Japanese printing vendors have associated with the weakness of the yen, which allowed them to price more aggressively. Further market contraction compounded this situation. We also experienced weakness in emerging markets and tough economic conditions in key countries. As we said in Q4, we consider this to be the new normal, and we are executing to our plan. Let me first discuss the core business results, starting with hardware units: which were down 20% year-over-year.  Approximately 7 points of the decline were the result of our pricing actions that drove higher average selling prices in constant currency. About 4 points were due to the reduction of hardware channel inventory. We effectively managed the channel with less promotional dollars, and as a result, our sellout share trends were better than our sell-in share trends. Worldwide inventory levels are healthy going into quarter 2.  About 3 points were associated with marginal units that we chose not to place as we worked more costs out of the system. And the remainder can be attributed to overall market contraction. Shifting to supplies. The year-over-year revenue was down 8% in constant currency. The factors driving the decline that were expected going into the quarter were installed-base erosion from declining hardware sales and channel inventory adjustments. The factors that varied from our plan where pricing and aftermarket share. Supplies pricing was up, given adjustments we made to offset some of the unfavorable currency, but not as much as planned given necessary discounting in the quarter to combat aftermarket alternatives. Our aftermarket share was more pressured than expected for toner. So what are we doing about it? We know the levers required to drive stability in a profitable supply revenue stream. We need to build back the hardware installed base with the shift to high-value units. Cost actions are in progress and on track so that we can place more of the marginal units profitably going forward. We need to win back aftermarket share, and we are already executing actions to support an aggressive share improvement plan, including online programs, and increased sales coverage to promote the value of original supplies. And we continue to strategically monitor supplies pricing so the currency adjustments don't result in increased aftermarket alternatives pressure. Despite the market headwinds, with our mitigation plans, we remain confident in our outlook for supplies revenues in constant currency to stabilize by the end of 2017. In addition to optimizing the core print business, we plan to continue to drive progress in our strategic areas, including graphics and managed print services, both of which grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency. As we said at SAM, we have tough quarters ahead, and while we are making progress, we have more work to do. I remain confident in the future. We have a strong product lineup, a powerful innovation road map and a proven ability to take costs out of the business. Now I'll turn it over to Cathie to go through more details and provide our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Dion. Before I begin, I want to comment on a few financial reporting items. The SEC filings and investor deck reflect historical financials for discontinued operations basis of accounting, which is also what I'll speak to today. In this accounting presentation, there are some historical expenses that are allocated fully to the parent company, which was HP Inc. in the U.S. Some examples include: corporate governance costs and SG&A, foreign exchange gains and losses and interest expense in OI&E, all related to HP Co. Because of these accounting rules, historical expenses reported in continuing operations are higher as compared to a pro forma operational view.  Net revenue, gross margin and R&D expense are more comparable year-over-year. Turning to the P&L results. Q1 performance was largely as expected. And overall, we are making progress against the strategy we laid out at SAM. At the company level, we reported net revenue of $12.2 billion, down 12% year-over-year or 5% at constant currency. While the EMEA and Americas regions continued to decline, we saw constant currency revenue growth in APJ, driven by strength in Personal Systems. We had a favorable impact due to onetime release of deferred revenue related to legacy HP Financial Services business, now that our engagement is no longer intracompany. This was accounted for in corporate elimination. Gross margin of 18.7% was down 0.7 points year-over-year due to the unfavorable mix and competitive pricing in print, partially offset by benign commodity costs and favorable mix in Personal Systems. Gross margin was down 0.6 points sequentially due to weak currencies and print mix, combined with continued competitive pricing. Operating profit of 7.5% was down 0.4 points year-over-year, driven by print gross margins and loss of operating expense leverage. Total operating expenses of $1.4 billion were down 14% year-over-year, primarily due to corporate governance costs related to HP Co. and currency. With a net expense of $94 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.36, in the middle of our outlook range. This result excluded charges of $20 million for restructuring and $8 million for amortization of intangible assets, more than offset by nonoperating retirement-related credits of $40 million. On a GAAP basis, Q1 diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.36. Turning to the segments. In Personal Systems, we continued to execute well against the tough market backdrop. In Q1, we delivered net revenue of $7.5 billion, down 13% year-over-year, as reported, or 6% in constant currency. In calendar fourth quarter, the overall PC market experienced steep declines, with units down 11% year-over-year according to IDC. The market contraction created a very competitive pricing environment and a battle for share gains. HP gained PC units share across all 3 regions, exceeding 20% share worldwide for the first time ever. As Dion said, we were very focused on higher-margin PC opportunities in strategic premium categories, including 2-in-1s, mobile workstations, thin clients, retail solutions and gaming. Our consumer premium category, where we are #1 among all Windows OEMs, continued to grow and gained over 4 points of share year-over-year. And our consumer gaming business is on track to double revenue by year-end. Amidst this competitive pricing environment, the team executed well by holding ASPs flat sequentially. Year-over-year, currency headwinds were offset by favorable mix, pricing and the increased attach of higher-configuration options, displays and services. Operating profit was 3.1%, down 0.4 points year-over-year due to loss of operating expense leverage and currency weakness, partially offset by favorable commodity costs, pricing and mix. Now on to print. Printing remained challenged in the quarter with net revenue of $4.6 billion, down 17% year-over-year, as reported, or 11% in constant currency, with declines in all regions. Emerging markets were particularly weak due to currency devaluation and overall economic slowdown. Operating profit was 17%, down 1.8 points year-over-year, due to the unfavorable currency and pricing environment, combined with loss of operating expense leverage, partially offset by favorable mix. Beyond the currency headwinds of 6 points, both hardware sales and supplies performance contributed to the overall revenue decline. Starting with hardware, consumer and commercial units were down 23% and 15% year-over-year, respectively. Overall, we were strategically focused on shaping the installed base with high-usage units, while also maintaining pricing discipline. As a result, we saw sequential improvement in constant currency ASPs in the inkjet and laser hardware portfolio, but units were down. When that was combined with channel inventory corrections, we lost 3 points of total share year-over-year in calendar fourth quarter. We gained 1 point of share in value multifunction laser printers and achieved share gains in design and large-format industrial printers.  Ink in the Office hardware units were down year-over-year, primarily due to managing sell-in volumes ahead of our product Refresh in the spring. Turning to supplies. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year, as reported, or 8% in constant currency and comprised 57% of the total print revenue. Supplies channel inventory was slightly above the range, but we reduced the inventory dollar value both year-over-year and sequentially. Although the business remained challenged, we made solid progress on our core and growth initiatives. In managed services, our new business total contract value was up double digits year-over-year, as reported, and our renewal rates remained strong. In Q1, we secured a significant new logo win with John Hopkins to produce over 20 million pages monthly. We saw continued momentum in Instant Ink, increasing enrollees over 30% sequentially. And graphics revenue grew once again year-over-year in constant currency. Contributing to this performance was a key win with Quantum Group, a print service provider who replaced its digital printing portfolio with a fleet of HP Indigo digital presses in order to accelerate turnaround time, increase quality and productivity and provide customers with enhanced application options. Now on an update for restructuring.  In Q1, about 400 people exited the company globally as part of the restructuring activities announced in September. As Dion mentioned, we are accelerating the program and now expect approximately 3,000 people will exit by the end of fiscal '16 instead of over 3 years.  In addition, we are driving significant nonlabor savings from non-revenue-generating operations in the second half of the year. The acceleration of the employee exits, and some of the incremental nonlabor savings will drive GAAP-only charges and associated cash payments of approximately $300 million in the current year. The labor actions will provide gross annual savings of approximately the same amount on a run-rate basis beginning in fiscal 2017. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. Q1 cash flow was disappointing, with cash used in operations of $108 million and free cash flow used of $228 million. Note that these results include separation cash payments of $78 million. We expected to generate free cash flow of about $300 million in Q1. The primary reason for the missed expectation was due to the actual revenue coming in lower particularly in Personal Systems, driving accounts payable and volume-sensitive accrued liabilities lower at quarter-end. The cash conversion cycle increased 4 days sequentially to negative 15 days. This was primarily driven by a decrease of 11 days of payables, driven by unfavorable linearity, volume and supplier mix in Personal Systems. The pressure on the cash conversion cycle from DPO was partially offset by improvements in DSO and DOI. The cash flow headwind in Q1 is mostly a timing issue due to the negative cash conversion cycle of this business. The only permanent impact to cash flow is from cash earnings on the reduced revenue. But because Personal Systems is slower to recover than originally assumed, we have implemented very targeted actions in an effort to positively impact each of the working capital metrics in order to offset the Q1 results and preserve the normalized free cash flow commitment for the full year. For example, we see opportunities to reduce inventory through better demand-supply matching, to increase DPO by extensions of payable terms and better purchasing linearity within each quarter. Given the acceleration of our restructuring activities, our fiscal '16 free cash flow outlook will be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion, a reduction of $100 million from our prior outlook. The updated outlook now assumes approximately $300 million for separation and $300 million for restructuring activity payments. We expect to retain our normalized annual free cash flow in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion. We repurchased 67 million shares in the quarter and paid $221 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of just over $1 billion. For the full year, we are on track to return 75% of free cash flow to shareholders. Looking forward, there are a few assumptions we've made in our financial outlook for Q2, specifically. In printing, we will continue to be strategic in placing hardware units, with a focus on those that yield high supplies usage over time, and we'll continue our pricing discipline. We expect this to yield a double-digit decline in hardware units year-over-year. Our reported supplies revenue is expected to decline double digits year-over-year, which is incorporated in our outlook of the stabilization in constant currency by the end of 2017. In graphics, we expect some softness in demand ahead of Drupa, the largest graphics printing trade show, consistent with the trends we have experienced in the past years leading up to this event, which occurs just once every 4 years. For fiscal 2016, in Personal Systems and printing, we expect our year-over-year revenue decline to moderate throughout the year, with improving market dynamics and lower channel inventory reductions. And our productivity initiatives and accelerated restructuring activities supports significant improvement in profitability in the second half. With all that in mind, I will provide our earnings outlook for continuing operations. Our Q2 '16 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.35 to $0.40. Our Q2 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38. And we are reaffirming our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Our full year fiscal '16 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is in the range of $1.52 to $1.62. With that, let's open it up to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I wanted to get a sense if you could provide us with some detail on what's happening in the PC market? The data points have been relatively negative. I think you said that you thoughts units declined 11% for the market this quarter. I wanted to see what trends you're seeing right now?
Dion Weisler: Thanks, Sherri. Look, as we've said, tough market conditions we expected that, we outlined that at the security analyst meeting, and we expect that for several quarters ahead. We broadly agree with IDC's predictions of the market sort of mid-single-digit declines. However, we see in the back half of this year that revenue will begin to improve as the technology improves and as channel inventory works its way out of the system. It's a continuous evolution. As market leaders, we are looking to evolve and create new categories. Look at the work we did this week in Mobile World Congress with the Elite x3. That's a terrific example of category creation. That's a new mobile solution. But it's not a PC. It's not a phablet. It's not a notebook. It's all 3. So the PC lines are kind of being redrawn at the moment. And our goal, as it has been consistently for the past 3 years, is to gain profitable share. We choose to play in certain areas, we choose not to play in other areas. So we have a fairly consistent formula here. We segment the market. We figure out where to play, where not to play. We continue to take costs out of the system. We continue to drive innovation into the system, and we're not after share for share's sake. I would say that Windows 10, whilst I still believe is a tremendous operating system platform and universal apps and continue computing make devices like the Elite x3 a reality, we have not yet seen the anticipated Windows 10 stimulation of demand that we would have hoped for. And we're carefully monitoring any sort of price developments that could further weaken demand. So we're operating in still a large market. The big guys are getting bigger, and we think there is opportunity in that landscape.
Catherine Lesjak: And actually, Sherri, let me add one more thing to the channel inventory, because we tightly manage our channel inventory overall, and we are in a healthy position. But we also manage our channel inventory very carefully from an aged perspective. I think, Dion, at one point gave an example of -- alluded to age channel inventory as rotting fish, and we're not in that situation. We are actually in a very nice position. That may be different than some of our competitors out there where we're hearing that there is still a fair amount of channel inventory. So I think we're well positioned.
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up, can I ask about the turnaround in the supplies business. The supplies business declined again, and just wanted to get an update on your thoughts about when we start to see that supplies revenue turn around?
Catherine Lesjak: So in our outlook for the year, we do expect that the supplies revenue trajectory will improve over the course of the year. We have very tough comparers year-over-year, because in the first half of last year, we had very favorable foreign exchange contracts. But what else also was very clear, and we updated this outlook on the Q4 earnings call that in fact the supplies revenue in constant currency will -- we expect will stabilize by the end of 2017, and we are reaffirming that today.
Dion Weisler: And, of course, as you know and as we've explained the full-box model, supplies is also a function of units that we place into the system. And so as we mentioned on the Q4 earnings call, we recognize that the challenging environment at the moment with the double-edged sword of the Japanese competitors leveraging a weaker yen, putting pressure on pricing was something that we needed to, indeed, respond to by taking costs out of the system, recognizing that this is, indeed, the new normal. And so we went to work. We've developed very robust plans to take non-revenue-generating costs out of the system so that we can place those marginal units, which, of course impacts supplies positively in the future.
Catherine Lesjak: So I think maybe this will be a good time maybe to briefly just talk about the 4-box model. As we talked about before, the key elements of how we're going to drive supplies revenue over time, the first is basically looking at the installed base, and looking at the installed base from a perspective of total size, to Dion's point, increasing the installed base by taking more costs out so that we can place units that are marginal today, that can be profitable in the future, is important. But it's also important to look at what the mix is within that installed base, which is the second box, which is around usage, and that's really focusing on placing higher-usage units. Then you also going to look at what your position is from a market share perspective. And we talked about -- I think Dion talked in his prepared remarks about the fact that we have a multipronged approach to drive increasing market share. Aftermarket share -- sorry, aftermarket supplies share with online, more feet on the street, but also driving Instant Ink adoption in our developed markets. We have in fact expanded our market to now include Spain and Canada, to continue to drive managed print services where we get a very high HP supplies attached. And we saw double-digit as-reported and constant currency growth in new TCV for managed print services, and then finally, kind of completing the rollout of jet intelligence in the laser market. When we come out with a new platform, that HP branded attach is extremely high. And we came out with this new platform called Jet Intelligence, and we're completing the rollout this year.
Operator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: I have one question for Cathie and one for Dion. So Cathie, your free cash flow obviously disappointed in the quarter. Can you help us think through how you think the linearity of this cash flows is going to play out this year? And if you could put that in context with maybe HP Inc.'s last year's cash flow linearity, that'll be helpful. How significantly different it will be this year versus last year? And I have a follow-up for Dion.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So to level set, our expectations for Q1 were that we would generate about $300 million worth of cash. But with the lower Personal Systems volume, combined with their very negative cash conversion cycle, it really put pressure on our accounts payable and our accrued liabilities, our volume-sensitive accrued liabilities, such as discounts. You might think that lower discount liability is a good thing, but if it's really falling in line with -- in proportion to revenue, it creates a challenge at the end of the quarter. And so we believe that a lot of that is timing, that at the end of the day the real permanent impact to cash flow over time is the cash earnings of that lost revenue.
Dion Weisler: And sort of in addition to that, let me say that we will respond to the cash position in the same way as we responded to the earnings challenges. We went to work. We have very targeted actions in place to address working capital: clear plans around driving inventory; lower, better supply demand matching within the teams; opportunities for us with some vendors on payment terms; and also really squarely focused on recovering aged inventory accounts receivables.
Catherine Lesjak: And so if you think about the linearity in the year, the linearity is different than what we've seen historically. And I think you'll understand that when I kind of lay out for you what is some of the key assumptions within our free cash flow outlook. First off, we are going to leverage the targeted working capital actions that we've taken as a result of the Q1 miss on expectations. And we do expect that we will end with a cash conversion cycle now that is probably at least as good as the FY '15 exit and potentially better by a couple of days. We also have to deliver our EPS of $1.59 to $1.69, and as I'm sure someone will talk to us in the -- or ask us about, it is a bit back-end loaded, which obviously is going to drive free cash flow a bit back-end loaded as well. PCs, we do expect the PC declines to moderate over the course of the year. And then we've got separation and restructuring cash payments of about $300 million each that are going to take place over year -- over the course of the year.
Wamsi Mohan: I appreciate the color there. And Dion, if I could follow up. I mean, the recent move in the Japanese yen, it's moved fairly strongly in the month of February. Have you seen any change in the pricing behavior at your Japanese competitors? And should this not be a tailwind relative to your prior assumptions? And Cathie noted some channel inventory correction as well impacting printer hardware. Is that now largely complete? Or is there more headwind in Q2?
Dion Weisler: So we have not yet seen material change from the Japanese competitors. I think many of our competitors have hedging strategies in place and it takes some time for movements in any given month to flow through to any other month. This is obviously something that we track very closely. We're continuously running price function value equations relative to our competitors. But at this stage, we just assume that the current environment is the new normal that we need to take those costs, nonrevenue-generating costs, out of the system. And that will allow us to place some marginal units.
Catherine Lesjak: And then from a channel inventory perspective on the hardware side, we are in a very healthy position. And so there shouldn't be any more channel inventory hardware units adjusted, that need to be adjusted. On the supply side, we are still slightly above our kind of targeted range. And so we do need some additional channel inventory correction in Q2, but we will be through that in -- by the end of the first half.
Dion Weisler: The hardware actions were very deliberate that we took here. And we said on the Q4 earnings call that we were looking to stabilize pricing in the market. Indeed, when you look at, on a constant currency basis, our ASPs were up sequentially. So indeed, we're doing what we said we would do then.
Operator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I think I also have one for Cathie and one for Dion. If I think about, Cathie, your capital return for this year at 75%, it basically implies that you'll continue paying the dividend and maybe there will be another $200 million in buybacks for the rest of the year. You've already done $800 million. Is that the right way to think about it? And a, why wouldn't capital return be higher? Why were the buybacks so uniquely concentrated in the first quarter? I think your trough in the stock was close to when you started going into the quiet period, so you clearly didn't bottom-ticket. Can you help us understand how to think about that capital return in the context of your original guidance? And then I have one for Dion.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Toni. So in terms of the math that you outlined at the beginning of your question, you are thinking about it correctly. In terms of your comment, we clearly didn't bottom-ticket. We put in place, at the beginning of the quarter, a 10b5-1 plan that covers us for every -- kind of the entire quarter, all the way through the earnings announcement. So we were buying based on our 10b5-1 in the market the entire time. So you're right, we didn't buy everything at the low, but we were buying continuously. In terms of doing more share repurchase, kind of our view is that capital allocation is important. Share repurchase is an important element of that and that we will continue to look at capital allocation on a returns-based basis. And that ultimately, in the big scheme of things, our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us. It's important to us on 2 dimensions. Our business is becoming more contractual and our customers, in some cases, they're demanding an investment-grade credit rating. In other cases, we just think it makes us more attractive. And then finally, wanting to make sure that we have the capacity and flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that might come up in the constantly evolving technology market.
Toni Sacconaghi: I meant on the bottom-ticket that you basically concentrated 80% of your buybacks in the first quarter of the year and that, that was sort of the question on, was that done because you wanted the maximum leverage on EPS, was there a fundamental belief that the stock price was uniquely low, and I guess the question would be how could you possibly have that belief knowing that markets are unpredictable but the uniquely high concentration of buybacks in the first quarter of the year.
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, we have the most dilution from employee benefit plans in the first quarter. And so that typically drives us to do more share repurchases at the front end of the year.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Dion, I wanted to just clarify and push you a little bit on supply. So when you guys talk about supply stabilizing at the end of 2017, that means that they will stop declining, so 0% growth or better. I just want to be sure I understand that. But more importantly, if I look at your hardware -- printer hardware revenues, they've declined for 18 out of the last 19 quarters. That's probably the best proxy for the first 2 boxes in your 4-box model, which is the installed base and the quality of the installed base, which is the function of revenue. If I think about the third part of your 4-box model, which is aftermarket share, you just conceded that aftermarket share actually declined this quarter. And my belief is, over the last 5 years, it's also gone down. So if I think about, in the fourth part of your 4-box model around the new platform, quite frankly, given that it's -- only applies to laser and that's less than half of your profits in IPG, I don't think it's big enough to move it. So I guess the question is what am I missing? I know the 4-box model sort of sounds very logical, and it is very logical. But when I systematically step through the pieces and say we've had 19 -- 18 out of 19 quarters of down hardware, aftermarket's going in the wrong direction, what am I missing that drives stabilization 6 quarters from now?
Dion Weisler: Yes. So the 4-box model is a predictive tool, and we use it extensively. It has a lot of complexity built into it. Not all units are created equally. We have -- we can place a particular unit in one demographic, place exactly the same unit in a different demographic. And it can yield an entirely different usage pattern, and we can have a different price associated with it. So when you think about all the permutations and combinations associated with that 4-box model, it is something that we focus on very carefully. And it shapes the way we place units, it informs how we price, and it even informs how we market. As we stated on last quarter's earnings, we expected the units to be down and that we're indeed down this quarter. Some of that was quite intentional, as we've already outlined. But characterizing the -- what I refer to as the new normal in a market environment where we think the currencies are going to continue to put downward pressure on pricing, what we structurally need to do is to take costs out of the system so that we can put marginal units back into the plan. So we are really focused on placing good units into the plan, those that are MPV-positive, taking costs out of our operations, particularly in the areas of nonrevenue-generating activities, and that will benefit us more in the second half than in the first half and that will enable us to put those units back in so it sort of addresses the first box. Managing those inventory levels was a key start to getting that done, and we did that in quarter 1. Then we said we have to turn to stimulating demand and driving price discipline into the market, and we did that. So some of the proof points, I think, as you look to evaluate the model is what's actually happening as a result of that. Our MPS business is continuing to grow in constant currency. Instant Ink grew 30% quarter-over-quarter, and that is, of course, our subscription-based service that's really important to address the declining home segment market. And the adoption rates there and the retention rates there are incredibly high. Our Graphics business is growing. Our ASPs improved quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. And areas of multifunction printers and high-value units also grew. With regards to aftermarket share, which is one of the other boxes that you referred to, competitors are pretty keen to understand what we're going to do here as well, so I'll remain at a relatively high level as I talk about this. The actions that we're taking vary geography by geography. They're very targeted. They're very segmented, as you would expect us to do. It's informed by big data wherever possible. We're increasing our supplies sales specialists in all of the regions and changing the marketing mix and where we spend marketing dollars to drive aftermarket supplies and sell the value of our HP original supplies. And we're reshaping the MBOs of the leadership team as well as the commission structures for our organization. And so there's some very comprehensive things afoot that gives us confidence that our supplies will return or stabilize in constant currency by the end of 2017.
Operator: The next question will come from Kulbinder Garcha of CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: I have just a couple of questions. The first one is just on the cost savings and the acceleration. Very simply, if we would look between fiscal year '15 and let's say, '17, Cathie, can you just tell us what the dollar cost savings number you hope to be on this kind of acceleration in the program that you mentioned? That's my first one. The second one is for Dion. Just on the supply side -- so sorry, on the market share gains that you hope to drive through in the Printing side, is that a mix shift back towards hardware and that hurts Printing, the IPG margins? Is that something you want us to take into account for a couple of quarters?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start on cost savings. So accelerating the restructuring that we talked about at the Security Analyst from 3 years into this year has obviously a huge labor component to it. And we expect that the gross annual savings as a result of those, that pull-in, is going to be roughly $300 million once we get through the entire program by the end of this year. But I also want to call out that when we talk about material improvements in our nonrevenue-generating costs, we're not just talking about labor actions. In fact, in the short term, the value in terms of cost reduction is going to be more in the nonlabor area, which will provide savings on an ongoing basis, some significant savings in this year, in the second half, and then going into '17.
Kulbinder Garcha: But you're not prepared to put a number around those nonlabor savings, Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't on the nonlabor side. On the labor side, it's roughly $300 million in savings starting into '17.
Dion Weisler: So let me say, Kulbinder, that you remember, at the Security Analyst Meeting, we talked about $1 billion of productivity improvements that we were looking to take out of the business. With now a quarter under our belt, we are confident about our ability to achieve the $1 billion of productivity improvements. However, given the current market environment, it was very clear to both Cathie and I that, that was not enough and that's why we accelerated our restructuring, both in terms of headcount but also these other activities. And so what that means is that we're looking to create capacity to put in marginal units back into plan, but we'll always do that in a very balanced way, balancing profit and protecting the future of the business. So if we see opportunity to place good units, we absolutely will.
Operator: The next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: You spent a fair amount of time in this call talking about prioritizing ASPs and value placements on both PCs and printers. Certainly not a new strategy, but can you talk about whether that has accelerated since the separation? And given that margins in both businesses are declining despite that positive mix shift and the favorable component pricing environment, it just would be helpful to understand why you think that's the right strategy, given the negative impact of lost unit scale. Then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: Okay. So well, let's first talk about the Personal Systems business. The -- if you look at the margin in the Personal Systems business, at the end of Q1, we delivered a 3.1% margin. It was down 0.6%, but the gross margin in that business was up slightly on a year-over-year basis. Because what was happening is that we had a significant currency headwind, 7 points of currency, and we had some opportunity but not, to the full extent of currency, to reprice. And so what this team really did, which was very positive, was that they managed the mix. And they managed the mix of the products and they also managed the attached, so that, in fact, ASPs were flatter, you could say up ever so slightly on a year-over-year basis. So the real pressure on the Personal Systems operating profit came from the volume declines and the pressure on the more fixed nature of the OpEx.
Dion Weisler: And all the while they did that whilst ensuring that our inventory was in very healthy positions. As Cathie referred to, I do refer to the whole PC business as a fish business. It's great when it's fresh. It makes you sick when it's off. And the ability to adjust to the market quickly is helped by the fact that our inventory was in pretty good position going into the quarter and is in pretty good position coming out of the quarter.
Catherine Lesjak: So what we're focused on doing across the company that we've talked about is obviously take -- reducing our nonrevenue-generating expenses. But we're also focused on continuing to variable-ize as much as possible our expense cost structure so that you don't lose this operating expense leverage when volumes are lighter. So that's the Personal side -- Personal Systems side. On the Printing side, really, the margin -- so we delivered a margin of 17%, down 1.8 points. And the pressure there was really around a very competitive pricing environment related to currency and then also just the strength of the dollar from a currency perspective that was a bigger headwind than the tailwind from supplies -- favorable supplies and hardware mix. And they also had struggled with -- or we also struggled with lots of operating expense leverage there, again, back to the fact that we've got to get our cost structure, our nonrevenue-generating cost structure down to operate in what we're calling the new normal. This is the environment in which we have to win and succeed.
Kathryn Huberty: So Dion, given what you've seen around the execution of moving to the higher-value segments and the impact on units, are you more or less married to that strategy?
Dion Weisler: Yes, I think the strategy is all about balance. You can't ever over-pivot towards the premium end of the range because then you lose scale across the business. You have to maintain a balance. I always maintained and have said for many years now that we were under-indexed in the premium parts of the market and it didn't mean that we would give up on the volume parts of the market, but we may just do better in the value parts of the market. I think, over the course of the last 3 years, in Personal Systems, Ron Coughlin and the team have done a tremendous job of moving up the stack, but at the same time, protecting our core position. And in Print, we're leveraging some amazing technology, with PageWide bringing Ink into the Office, the new JetIntelligence series, driving up the stack with multifunction printers, PageWide, Excel and new Graphics printers, is very much on strategy. But we have to protect the core as well.
Operator: Your next question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I had a couple of questions as well. The first is on the balance sheet and use of cash, and that, I mean, you're at basically $3 billion net debt at the moment. You're generating a significant amount of cash, and you talked about getting back to the $2.9 billion of operating cash flow. So I guess my question is where the stock is at right now, why not be more aggressive with share repurchase, maybe lever up a bit? I think it seems like a good opportunity. It doesn't appear there any pending acquisitions that are sort of hanging out there. And given the end markets and the pressure you're seeing, is this an opportunity that's sort of giving itself to you, given some of the pressure that you've seen in earnings in that and what the stock price has done? And just sort of maybe, overall, how are you thinking about it? I know you want investment grade, but there's clearly some room before you start hitting up against that ceiling.
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I think, Shannon, we've been pretty clear on our capital allocation framework. We evaluate all investment opportunities against one another, ensuring that the choices we make are aligned to maximize risk-adjusted returns. And Cathie alluded to that on her earlier response. We've always said that share repurchase is a key part of the capital allocation priorities. We have a very disciplined framework in place to support the activity, including plans with valuation triggers. But indeed, there's other parts of the business that we need to invest in. I continue to believe in our strategy. I believe in our team. I believe in our partners and our future. We have a clear focus on the core. We have growth opportunity in mobility and graphics and in the A3 parts of the market that we'll enter in 2017 and a very exciting future around 3D printing and Immersive Computing. So is there value here from my vantage point? You bet there is, but it requires good old-fashioned hard work and discipline.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then I guess that opens up to my next question, was to talk a little bit more about the opportunities in 3D and the copier, the A3 market. Sort of how are you thinking about it as you go through the, I guess, 2,600 people that need to be laid off over this year, how do you sort of cull those people while supporting the growth areas and keeping everything on track? And I would assume we're going to see 3D printing at Drupa based on some of the things we've seen on the web, but how do you -- we think about sort of that rollout since that's obviously coming before we get to the A3 initiative?
Dion Weisler: Yes, so look, we remain on track with both our 3D printing launch as well as our A3 product lineup. We're excited by those opportunities. We recognize that the A3 copier space is probably a shorter-term upside market. It's a $55 billion market where we have a very low market share, as you well know. And we're excited by entering that space. The 3D printing today is still relatively nascent as a market, but we believe we have groundbreaking disruptive technology that will address both the production and prototyping space of the commercial markets. We're on track. I was recently in Barcelona doing a review with the team where it was developed, and there's some super exciting stuff going on in here and we look forward to unveiling it at the appropriate time.
Catherine Lesjak: And real quickly, Shannon, when we talk about pulling forward approximately 3,000 headcount reductions, that's not in the core areas of investment. So it's not touching A3 or 3D. It's really focused on nonrevenue-generating costs in the core. It is -- we are protecting it, in fact, it was a mandate when we started working through the programs in December that we weren't touching R&D.
Dion Weisler: It's the prime directive. I think our portfolio is the best it has ever been. And that doesn't happen without investment, whether it's the work that Ron and the team are doing on Personal Systems or the work that Enrique Lores and his team are doing on Print and Steve Nigro in 3D printing. We've been very deliberate around ring-fencing the innovation agenda.
Operator: And the final question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup.
Jim Suva: And one question for Dion and one question for Cathie, and I'll just give them now. Dion, to use your example, a little bit about stale fish, stale fish in the kitchen, kind of what happens, in your experience, with the stale fish analogy? The pricing, the products that just get dumped in the trash that they would stink up the room for everybody. What happened when stale fish in excess PC inventory happened in the past? And for Cathie, you reiterated earnings per share, but you took free cash flow down by $100 million. And I understand Q1 was disappointing and free cash flow was negative, but it also seemed like a lot of the negative Q1 free cash flow was due to unfortunate timing of payables, which might see payback around that, could be we can revert in the quarter or so. So can you help bridge the gap of why free cash flow is down $100 million, yet earnings per share you reiterated?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, so Jim, that's entirely due to the fact that we've pulled in the restructuring of approximately 3,000 people. So that's the cost of the incremental people in fiscal 2016. So if you look at it on a normalized basis, we're still at $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion for the year.
Dion Weisler: So -- and Jim, to answer your question on what happens in the fish business is those that have a lot of stale fish, it's very expensive, and those that have fresh fish tend to do better. And so you can take advantage of a situation where the channel inventory is relatively high, component prices drop. You're holding fresh inventory, you can pass through those savings and newer technology faster to your customers. And keeping the industry fresh is something that our customers are looking for, and that if you're out of position on inventory, that becomes very costly. So that's the implication. So unfortunately, we are out of time. And I thank everyone for joining. Clearly, we laid out our strategy at our Security Analyst Meeting and meeting the obligations and delivering the results that we outlined amidst a continued tough market backdrop. I think the team has delivered a clear strategy that leverages our strength and innovations to protect our core, to capture growth opportunities in natural adjacencies and capitalize on future opportunities in new markets. We're focused on execution, taking cost out of the business and delivering innovations that will amaze our customers and partners. So I hope to see some of you in DÃ¼sseldorf, at Drupa in just a few months, where we will showcase our leadership in the digital graphics market. I appreciate your support. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in person in the coming weeks and months ahead. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-11-24 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2015 Hewlett-Packard Company Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Diana Sroka, HP Inc. Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Diana Sroka: Good afternoon, I am Diana Sroka, Head of Investor Relations for HP Inc., and I'd like to welcome you to the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call. Given we operated as a combined company through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we decided to report our results together today. Going forward, starting with Q1 fiscal '16, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will report earnings as separate companies. I will outline how the call will flow today since it will be a little different than our typical earnings calls. Meg will kick things off with Q4 highlights for Hewlett-Packard Company, and Cathie will follow with additional details. After that, Meg and Tim will review segment results and outlook for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and Cathie will review segment results and outlook for HP Inc. Finally, we'll open it up to questions. Before we begin, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and a slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HP Inc.'s Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com and on Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's Investor Relations web page at www.hpe.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP Inc.'s and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's annual reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2015. For financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. Finally, each of the unaudited pro forma Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.'s fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and cash flow information presented in this call and the accompanying presentation is based on the estimated contributions of each company to Hewlett-Packard Company's fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow as adjusted to give effect to the separation transaction effective on November 1, 2015. The pro forma amounts do not necessarily reflect that the fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net EPS and cash flow of Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. would have been had the separation occurred on November 1, 2014. They also may not be useful in predicting the future financial condition and results of operations of the separate companies. The actual financial positions and results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors. With that, let me turn it over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. The fourth quarter was the final quarter where Hewlett-Packard operated as one combined company. On November 1, we completed the historic separation and became 2 separate independent public companies: HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. I couldn't be prouder of how we executed on the incredibly complex separation. Throughout the year-long separation process, we saw no disruption to our customers and partners, and we continued to drive the business forward. And now, both companies are off and running. Each company has a clear, well-defined strategy and is well positioned to win in its respected market. Before we get into the business segment performance and outlook, I'll let Cathie provide details on the Q4 results of the previously combined company.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Hewlett-Packard Company net revenue for the quarter was $25.7 billion, down 9% year-over-year as reported or down 3% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $103.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or down 2% in constant currency. Gross margin was 24.7%, up 0.1 point year-over-year and up 0.9 points quarter-over-quarter, with sequential improvement across all of our major business segments. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $4 billion were down 5% year-over-year, driven by a reduction in SG&A, partially offset by our continued focus on increasing our R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was 9.1%, down 0.5 points year-over-year and up 0.5 points sequentially. With a net expense of $151 million in OI&E, a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a diluted share count of approximately 1.8 billion shares, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.93 in Q4, within our outlook range. Q4 non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $676 million for separation, $591 million for restructuring, $246 million for amortization of intangible assets and net tax benefits of $803 million. For the full year, we delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $3.59, in line with our previously provided outlook range. On a GAAP basis, Q4 diluted net earnings per share was $0.73, above our outlook range due to the net tax benefits just mentioned. These were onetime, noncash entries comprising a number of different items, including the reversal of a previously recorded U.S. tax valuation allowance that I discussed on the Q3 earnings call. The total separation costs, CapEx and associated cash flows expected across FY '15 and FY '16, in total, were originally $2.8 billion. And we now expect $2.4 billion in that same time period. The mix of expenses between onetime separation costs, CapEx and incremental taxes was different than planned, with taxes coming in well under our plans in Q4. The 2012 restructuring program is nearly complete, with approximately 4,300 people exiting the company in Q4 '15 and just under 56,000 cumulative reductions for the program to date. Even with labor migration, we are down a net 59,000 people over this time frame. In Q4, we recorded GAAP-only charges of $591 million. Approximately $200 million were the final charges associated with the 2012 program, and the remainder were associated with the new restructuring program that each company discussed at their respective Security Analyst Meetings in September. We delivered cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion and free cash flow of $1.8 billion in the quarter. This brings our total free cash flow for the year to $3.3 billion, which is just below our outlook range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. There was a tailwind from separation costs coming in lower as described. This was more than offset by the following: other receivables, including VAT; elevated financing receivables driven by higher HP Financial Services volume; cash outflow for restructuring; and lower earnings. In Q4, we returned $638 million of capital to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases, and $4.1 billion was returned to shareholders for the full year. We returned over 100% of free cash flow to our shareholders in fiscal '15, even excluding the capital return of $750 million that completed our 2014 commitment. I'll now turn it over to Meg and Tim to discuss the results of the segments that are now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Then Dion and I will return to share comments on Printing and Personal Systems, the new HP Inc.
Margaret Whitman: Thanks, Cathie. As we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting in September, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has 5 key priorities for FY '16. We plan to grow top line revenue in constant currency, drive a year-over-year increase in operating profit, grow free cash flow, continue to execute our innovation road map and stabilize revenue and expand margins in Enterprise Services. And I'm pleased to say that overall, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is off to a very strong start. First and foremost, the segments that comprise HPE have now had 2 consecutive quarters of constant-currency revenue growth, and we believe we're in a strong position to deliver on our plans to grow overall in FY '16 in constant currency. Also, while there is more work to do, particularly in ES, our cost structure is much closer to where it needs to be, thanks to aggressive supply chain management, SKU rationalization and workforce rebalancing. With respect to cash, we are starting the year with a net cash position at the operating company level and as separation costs wind down, we are well positioned to increase cash flow at FY '16. The innovation we've been investing in over the past 4 years is paying off. We've introduced breakthrough new solutions and services that have driven a mix shift in our portfolio towards higher-growth products and services. By leaning into new technology, we are ideally positioned to take advantage of market trends that will allow us to continue to take share from our competitors and to drive long-term growth. Finally, while each business segment faces different challenges and opportunities, the company as a whole is aligning tightly around the 4 customer transformation areas we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. Customers tell us our focus is spot-on. I'm confident that our clear strategy will accelerate the significant progress we've already made in our financial performance. Now, before Tim gets into the financial details, let me provide some highlights from the quarter across each segment. In Enterprise Group, we performed exceptionally well, with strong revenue growth up 2% as reported or 9% in constant currency and improved profitability on a sequential basis. Our Industry Standard Server business was strong, with constant-currency revenue growth across all regions, driven by solid core growth and increasing demand from Tier 1 service providers. Looking forward, we are well positioned to benefit from the server market upswing, driven by the growth in cloud and big data. The Networking business also performed, well with the Aruba acquisition driving strong cross-selling opportunities across wireless and data center switching. Storage significantly outpaced the market, and we expect that we gained close to a point of share in the third calendar quarter. Our 3PAR All-Flash portfolio is outperforming the competition. 3PAR All-Flash is now a $500 million annualized run rate business and grew triple digits in the fourth quarter. That's larger and growing faster than Pure in their most recently reported quarter. In fact, just last week, Gartner rated 3PAR as the best storage product on the market across every use case category. This is a powerful recommendation to our customers and partners and will help us continue to drive share gains against our competitors. Finally, in Technology Services. We continue to see a growing proportion of the business come from high-value services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care, while operating margins remained steady. Turning to Enterprise Services. We had the best performance in Q4 that we've had in years due to a more diversified customer base, stabilized constant-currency revenue growth and a significantly reduced cost structure. Revenue declined 2% in constant currency, although we grew new logos and saw double-digit growth in Strategic Enterprise Services, driven by strength in Helion cloud and security services. Operating profit was 8% in the quarter, the best performance since 2011. For the full year, both revenue and operating margins were in the range of our outlook. Looking ahead, we have a clear plan in place to get to a longer-term sustainable target operating margin of 7% to 9%. In Software, we delivered strong margins while continuing to take steps to align the portfolio and the go-to-market approach with the 4 transformation areas. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year in constant currency or flat, if you normalize for recent M&A transactions on a pro forma basis. During the quarter, we announced several transactions, including the sale of TippingPoint and LiveVault, which will allow us to focus our resources and investments in higher-growth strategic businesses. Finally, our Financial Services business continues to be a differentiator for the company. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Financial Services helps customers by creating consumption-based models to buy new technology or financing programs to transition out of legacy systems. Total FY '15 financing volume increased 9% year-over-year in constant currency. As I have said before, HPE's innovation engine is humming, and Q4 was no exception. During the quarter, we introduced important new solutions and continued to see strong customer traction across the portfolio. For example, in September, we announced several new security solutions to help customers quickly detect high-risk threats, reduced data breach impact and enhance overall security. We also won several significant new security deals in the quarter, including new wins for our Voltage and Fortify solutions with a major financial services company. In Enterprise Services, we announced a significant new partnership with Microsoft and HP Inc. to enable Windows 10 adoption and drive employee mobility for the enterprise. As part of the agreement, we will build and sell industry-specific business applications for Windows 10 across key industries such as retail, energy and transportation. This agreement is a great example of how Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will work together going forward. In Servers, we saw continued strong customer momentum with our leading portfolio of Apollo high-performance compute solutions. We are the clear market leader in high-performance computing. And today, more than 1/3 of the market is leveraging HPE compute platforms to process, analyze and manage data securely. Cloud is another important growth driver for us, and we saw strong momentum in the quarter. We are the leading cloud infrastructure provider, and we see a significant opportunity as enterprises move to a hybrid cloud environment. In late October, we announced HP Helion OpenStack 2.0, our latest enterprise-grade cloud platform with new life cycle management and security enhancements. We believe strongly in open standards, and our OpenStack-based cloud offerings provide the open, agile and secure hybrid cloud environment our customers are asking for. We also refined our cloud strategy during the quarter. Our goal is to help customers source, manage and consume services across traditional, private, public and managed cloud environments. To that end, we announced in October that we will double down on our private and managed cloud capabilities and sunset our public cloud offering. This is the right move. It plays to our strengths in private and managed cloud. We will continue to extend our cloud infrastructure leadership and integrate the public cloud element for our customers through a strategic partner-based model. In line with that approach, we've reached an agreement with Microsoft that you'll hear more about during Discover next week. Microsoft shares our view of a hybrid-IT approach for enterprises, and we both see opportunity to simplify hybrid infrastructure for our customers. Going forward, Microsoft and Azure will become a preferred public cloud partner. HPE will serve as a preferred provider of Microsoft's infrastructure and services for its hybrid cloud offerings. Overall, the move to a hybrid cloud environment presents a significant growth opportunity for us, and you can expect to hear more about our approach in coming months. And on that note, I'll hand the call over to Tim Stonesifer.
Tim Stonesifer: Thanks, Meg. Hewlett Packard Enterprise finished the year on a strong note, and we're already executing against the financial architecture we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting. This calls for solid growth from EG, with stable to slightly up margins, stabilizing revenue and ES with strong margin expansion, stabilizing software revenue with good profitability, all while leveraging Financial Services with their good return on equity. In Q4, our segments collectively delivered revenue of $14.1 billion, which was up 3% year-over-year in constant currency. This marks the second quarter in a row of delivering year-over-year constant-currency growth, and we expect to take share in x86 servers, storage and networking during the third calendar quarter. For the full fiscal year 2015, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be $1.84, in the middle of the previously provided outlook. Similarly, we estimate HPE's contribution to HP's total free cash flow for the year to be $1 billion, just below the previously provided outlook. We benefited from a push-out of separation costs that was offset primarily by the timing of value-added tax receivables and restructuring payments, along with the higher-financing receivables that Cathie mentioned in her remarks. Now turning to the segments. The Enterprise Group continued its strong momentum, growing revenue 2% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Operating profit improved sequentially by 1 point to 14% and was down 0.8 points year-over-year, primarily due to currency. Industry Standard Servers grew 5% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency and was up across all geographies in constant currency. The work we have done segmenting the market and delivering innovative products has enabled us to capture more than our fair share of this strong market. We expect server momentum to continue next year but at a moderated pace given more difficult compares. Business Critical Systems declined 8% year-over-year but only 2% in constant currency. This was our strongest year-over-year revenue growth in over 3 years as our mission-critical x86 and NonStop platforms offset the challenges from Itanium. Storage declined 7% but was flat in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. Converged Storage grew 17% in constant currency and was 53% of the portfolio. We are now seeing our R&D investments pay off with exceptional growth in All-Flash, which has taken over 10 points of share in the last year. We expect the improving mix of Converged Storage to drive overall growth in fiscal year 2016 at improved margins and with better TS attach. Networking grew 35% year-over-year or 43% in constant currency and grew high single digits in constant currency, excluding Aruba. The recent strategic moves we've made are already yielding results. The Aruba acquisition is driving incremental opportunities from the campus wireless refresh, and we've returned to growth in China following the announcement of our partnership with Tsinghua. We expect to close the Tsinghua transaction in Q1. TS declined 11% or 4% in constant currency, impacted by tough compare in consulting from the prior year. Order growth was flat year-over-year in local currency, lighter than expected. This was partially due to customers in China waiting for the Tsinghua transaction to close before signing new multiyear support contracts. Additionally, we had a higher mix of Tier 1 service provider growth in Servers that attach little support. We're addressing these issues with more value-added services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care that are increasing our support-attached dollars on a per unit basis. For the full year, orders were up 1% in local currency, and TS continues to be on track for flat constant-currency revenue in fiscal year '16. In Enterprise Services, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when you exclude the top 3 account runoff. For full fiscal 2015, we saw total bookings growth, driven by new logo signings and solid renewals. Our cost actions also delivered strong margin expansion. Profitability was up 1.4 points year-over-year to 8.2% for the quarter, the highest it's been since the second quarter of 2011. Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing was down 11% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. We saw encouraging constant-currency growth in EMEA, which was previously our most challenged region. Application and Business Services was down 5% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency, our strongest constant-currency result in over 3 years. This result is especially encouraging since ABS carries the highest-operating margins within ES. In Software, revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency and was flat when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, achieving operating margins of 30.1%, down 1.3 points year-over-year due mostly to currency. We enjoyed good revenue growth in security and double-digit revenue growth in big data year-over-year in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. In particular, license revenue for Vertica increased in excess of 50% year-over-year, driven by several large wins in North America. SaaS also grew year-over-year in constant currency and in each business when normalized for acquisitions on a pro forma basis and divestitures. Going forward, we expect better alignment with the Enterprise Group and Enterprise Services to improve cross-selling opportunities. However, we also continue to expect pressure on the top line as we evolve our go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. In Financial Services, revenue declined 11% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, with operating profit declining 1.3 points to 11%. The challenges to both revenue and profitability were entirely due to unfavorable currency and a tough compare. Financing is playing an increasingly strategic role for our customers, with volume up 9% in constant currency during fiscal year 2015. Financing volume is a good indicator of future revenue performance. The return on equity remained healthy at 16.4%. With that, let's turn to the outlook. On the top line, we expect the momentum of Q3 and Q4 constant-currency revenue growth to continue through fiscal year '16. The currency environment continues to be volatile, and based on current rates, we expect a 3-point headwind of revenue in fiscal year '16. Before I give our EPS outlook, let me provide some guidance for earnings seasonality at the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise. In general, EPS will be back-end-loaded for a few reasons: First, both Enterprise Services and Software margins normally expand throughout the year from a low in Q1; second, the benefits we receive from restructuring will continue ramping over time; and finally, the negative impact from dis-synergies will decline throughout the year. With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.37 to $0.41 in the first quarter of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.09 to $0.13 in Q1 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. We continue to expect free cash flow of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. However, please keep in mind that cash flow is seasonally lowest in the first quarter. And in fiscal year '16, it will also be impacted by the majority of the remaining separation payments. Finally, for capital allocation, earlier this month, we announced our Q1 dividend of $0.055 per share, in line with our commitment to distribute approximately $400 million in the form of dividends in fiscal year '16. We remain committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow for the full year to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In closing, let me say that I'm pleased with the progress we are making against the 5 key priorities we discussed at our Securities Analyst Meeting. The business has momentum, and our financial architecture continues to strengthen. In short, I'm excited about our prospects and the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dion.
Dion Weisler: Thank you, Tim. The Printing and Personal Systems markets are experiencing challenges right now. As we discussed on the Q3 earnings call and in more detail at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expected to have several tough quarters, and Q4 was indeed a difficult quarter and somewhat weaker than we expected. Following separation, we remain confident that we are well positioned for the long term in the marketplace. The market challenges do not intimidate us, and we are keenly aware of what we need to be focused on going forward. Turning to the results. Overall, in Q4, our business performance was mixed. In Personal Systems, we executed well against the expected tough market backdrop, while Printing represented a much greater challenge due a number of factors that have changed our near-term view of the market and the supplies revenue trajectory. Before I go into those details on Printing, let me briefly reflect on the Q4 results for Personal Systems. The PC market continued to be tough, especially in Consumer, where industry channel inventory remained elevated in the market. While we saw improved performance in the U.S., EMEA remained weak, with market units declining 22% year-over-year in the third calendar quarter as we foreshadowed at the Security Analyst Meeting. As I've said in the past, when markets are down, our ability to outperform the market profitably is key. HP gained unit share in calendar third quarter in each of our 3 regions, achieving 19.7% market share worldwide. We continue to extend our lead in the market with Commercial PC share of 23.7%, our highest share position ever. And we managed to do this all while improving Personal Systems operating profit by 0.8 of 1 point sequentially to 3.8%. We believe that innovation and sprinkles of magic are key to differentiation as the PC market goes through consolidation. In Q4, we introduced a robust portfolio of enterprise class and consumer PCs with a number of form factors and industry firsts. And we announced a partnership with Disney and Lucasfilms around Star Wars: The Force Awakens, delighting our customers with the launch of our Star Wars Special Edition Notebook PC. Looking ahead, we expect the PC market to remain challenged for more quarters to come. As expected, Windows 10 has not been a material catalyst for sales yet but continues to receive favorable reviews. We see the most adoption in the U.S. retail segment, and our share here is very strong. We maintain that this new operating system is important for the industry and a contributing factor to support a future hardware refresh cycle. Turning to Printing. We saw accelerated revenue declines across hardware and supplies, and there have been a couple of factors that have changed since the Security Analyst Meeting. The most significant factor was the continued effects of currency movements that have accelerated pricing pressures, even more than we expected in certain profitable segments of the printing markets. Secondly, the market was somewhat weaker than we expected in the calendar third quarter, and you're seeing this in our results, and you saw it in the results of some of our peers, some of whom have announced their intentions to reevaluate strategic options. We do not expect the landscape to improve in the near future, and we will constantly assess how the market evolves. In any case, our market leadership and scale serve us well, but we have much more work to do on many dimensions. Specifically in hardware, we saw a 17% year-over-year unit decline due to 3 factors. Firstly, the hardware market continued to contract with calendar third quarter total units down 6% year-over-year, down more than we expected. Secondly, pressure in the unit performance was a planned channel inventory reduction. We consciously elevated inventory levels in Q3 in advance of the IT system cutover as part of our separation-related continuity planning. The good news is that with the reduction in Q4, the hardware channel inventory is now within the desired range as we finish the year. So approximately 3/4 of the unit decline is linked to the market and channel inventory reduction. Thirdly, with the market down more than expected, the competitive pricing environment was even more challenging in certain profitable segments where usage is high. Let me take a moment to outline the impact currency is having on the pricing dynamics in the market. We have seen further reduction in average unit prices in key segments. Our competitors have leveraged currency advantages to drive down pricing, and we have responded in kind. This has changed the price points for certain units and means that some units in specific markets were no longer MPV positive. And as we said we would do, we have responsibly been going after profitable share gains and walking away from negative MPV hardware unit deals. Another consequence of lower average unit price points is that we are attracting buyers that may have different usage patterns than we originally targeted. For example, the pricing of some of the Officejet pro hardware has fallen into price bands that are within reach of home users who typically print less. The unintended result is that we are not getting the yield per unit we would have expected on some of these units. We see this impacting our supplies revenue trajectory. Q4 '15 supplies revenue was not where we expected it to be, and we have more work to do. We will accelerate initiatives across all of the levers we pull to improve the supplies revenue trajectory. Examples of these initiatives include driving programs to increase ink usage and to increase aftermarket supply share. On ink usage, we expect to accelerate our Instant Ink subscription service, with programs that increase our attach rate. In Q4, one of the programs was to expand the number of models and therefore price points that Instant Ink addresses, ensuring more customers never run out of ink. We are confident that the fundamentals of the 4-box model are sound. We believe all of these actions will help improve the trajectory of supplies revenue over time. However, given the unit declines and changing usage patterns, the data from our 4-box model is indicating that we expect the stabilization in ink supplies revenue to be delayed towards the end of 2017 as we drive these initiatives. We are moving quickly on 3 vectors: We remain focused on solution-ing the $1 billion of productivity improvements we laid out at the Security Analyst Meeting; secondly, we can't compete on price alone, so we are balancing our pricing actions with increased marketing and sales activity to stimulate demand; and finally, we have to materially change our non-revenue generating cost structure to compete aggressively. This may both accelerate and increase the previously announced restructuring actions. In closing, we firmly believe in our strategy around core growth in the future as outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Let me remind you, we are still the leader in large consolidating markets. We have scale, innovation, channel reach and an incredible brand. While the markets are challenging now, we believe the actions we are taking now will protect the core that generates the majority of our cash flow, and of course, we will continue to invest in adjacent market opportunities and our future. I'll now turn it over to Cathie, who can provide additional details and our financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you, Dion. Printing net revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 9% in constant currency. As expected, the year-over-year currency impact was greater than past quarters as favorable long-dated financial hedges matured. From a channel inventory perspective, we've reduced both hardware and supplies levels year-over-year and sequentially, but we are still slightly above-target weeks of supply range for supplies. Supplies revenue was down 10% year-over-year as reported or down 5% on constant currency and was 65% of the revenue mix in the quarter. We had some bright spots in the quarter, including constant-currency revenue growth in Graphics. Also, Managed Print Services revenue grew double digits in constant currency year-over-year in Q4. And for fiscal '15, we saw strong growth, both as reported and in constant currency, in total contract value for our partner MPS offering. From an operating profit perspective, we delivered 17.4%, down 0.8 points year-over-year. Currency headwinds and competitive pricing were only partially offset by strong supplies mix. Turning to Personal Systems. Revenue was down 14% year-over-year as reported or down 7% in constant currency. Consumer and Commercial PC units were each down year-over-year, but we outperformed the market in calendar Q3, gaining 0.3 points of share in Consumer and 1.6 points of share in Commercial. We've done a lot of work to drive to a variable cost structure, which supports our profitability in these down quarters.  Personal Systems' operating process improved sequentially to 3.8% on the strength of gross margins but was down 0.2 points year-over-year as a result of reduced operating expense leverage on lower volumes despite OpEx reductions and improved gross margins. Gaining cost efficiencies will position us well as the market slowly recovers. Considering the combined performance of the Printing and Personal Systems segments in the context of the overall Hewlett-Packard Company results, we estimate our pro forma contribution to the non-GAAP EPS result for fiscal '15 to be about $0.01 below the baseline range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. Our pro forma free cash flow contribution to the company was approximately $2.3 billion for fiscal '15, within the range we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. Turning to the financial outlook. Beginning in Q1 '16, the new HP Inc. will make a reporting change related to pension. For the last several years, we have had pension income. Our pension liabilities and assets are revalued each October 31 based on interest rates and asset values on that day. This can drive nonoperational volatility in our pension income from year-to-year. For FY '15, this volatility causes a year-over-year decrease in pension income of approximately $90 million, and we don't expect this to have an impact to FY '16 cash flow. Without a change in reporting method, however, this headwind would have put incremental pressure on our investments, and suboptimizing our business for nonoperational impact is not in our best long-term interest. Specifically, the change relates to the expected performance of the planned assets and interest rate movements, the market-related factors in determining pension income or expense. We will exclude these market-related factors from the non-GAAP operational results going forward. With this reporting change, the service costs associated with our pension plans and the amortization of prior service costs will continue to be reported as operational expenses within our non-GAAP results. For more information, please refer to the Investor Relations earnings presentation, which includes a few slides detailing the change. We believe that going forward, this reporting change provides a greater transparency to underlying operating results. However, the reporting change will result in a reduction of our non-GAAP EPS outlook, given we will now exclude our nonoperational pension income. Moving to revenue. As discussed at the Security Analyst Meeting, we expect year-over-year constant-currency declines to moderate, but currency will continue to be a headwind to revenue of about 3 to 4 points in FY '16. Since then, net currency moves have been unfavorable, and we see only incremental pressure to both revenue and operating profit year-over-year. Our non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be about 1 point lower than the 22% to 23% range provided at the Security Analyst Meeting given the pension reporting change noted. For Q1 specifically, keep the following things in mind. The Personal Systems and Printing markets continue to be tough. Supplies revenue will continue to be under pressure as we reduce supplies channel inventory, and the supplies revenue trajectory improvement will take longer. Given the pricing dynamics Dion laid out, we expect printer units to be down double digits year-over-year as we continue to focus on profitable unit placements. And finally, productivity improvements are expected to ramp throughout the year. Considering these factors, we expect the first half operating profit to be lower than our typical in-year seasonality. With all that in mind, the HP Inc. Q1 '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.33 to $0.38, inclusive of the pension reporting change. Our full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $1.59 to $1.69. Operationally, our non-GAAP EPS outlook is unchanged, but with the exclusion of nonoperating pension income, there is a reduction of $0.08 in fiscal '16 as compared to what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting. On a GAAP basis, Q1 '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $0.27 to $0.32, and our full year FY '16 GAAP net earnings per share outlook range is $1.50 to $1.60. The reduction in the full-year GAAP EPS outlook of $0.05 in fiscal '16 from what we provided at the Security Analyst Meeting is associated with the following: $0.03 for lower pension income as a result of the revaluation of pension assets and liabilities as of October 31, 2015, and $0.02 is associated with the amortization of intangibles related to the marketing optimization shift to HP Inc. and the separation charges that move from FY '15 to FY '16. For FY '16, we expect our normalized free cash flow to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, consistent with the discussion at the Security Analyst Meeting. However, we are adjusting our free cash flow outlook to a range of $2.4 billion to $2.7 billion, down $100 million due to separation payments that slipped from FY '15. Finally, for capital allocation, we announced earlier this month that we will be paying a dividend of $0.124 per share in fiscal '16. We remain committed to a total capital return to shareholders for the full year to be at the high end of our overall framework of 50% to 75% of free cash flow. We expect that share repurchases will drive a moderate decline in weighted average shares outstanding beginning in Q1. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: It sounds like some of the businesses, printers in particular, deteriorated as you moved through the quarter and, yet, DSOs are up 3 days year-on-year. So can you talk about linearity and just the overall tone of business as you exited the quarter? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: So at the kind of Personal Systems and Printing side of the house, so PPS because we don't have HP Inc. today, at the PPS level, our cash conversion cycle actually was a bit better than what we had laid out for you at the Security Analyst Meeting. And so from our perspective, we performed very well with respect to working capital.
Kathryn Huberty: And then on the Enterprise side of the business, how did linearity look versus normal?
Tim Stonesifer: True. I mean as we spoke about at the Analyst Meeting, we had -- in 3Q, we had about 30 days and that was a little bit elevated given by the fact of our business continuity plans that we had in place. So as we had anticipated, we have worked those down and we're sort of in the mid-20s range. And that's what I would think about as you think about 2016.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then, Dion, you mentioned that some of your peers in printing are going through strategic reviews and I imagine that may, over time, open up competitive opportunity. But curious whether you have interest in the near term at looking at any assets, not mentioning any in particular, but looking at some of those assets that may come for sale and driving scale in the Printing business.
Dion Weisler: Yes. Thanks, Katy. Look, obviously, as a matter of policy, we don't comment on those sorts of matters. But our general approach to M&A has not changed since we had the discussion at the Security Analyst Meeting. We will continue to look for opportunities that are complementary to our strategy that will always be return-based in nature. They'll be thoughtful and disciplined and they'll land clearly and squarely on the strategy page, so they will be in our core across growth and in the future. Areas that we have talked about have been in the areas of 3D print and material, specifically around document workflow solutions, sprinkles of magic but, generally, not broadly consolidation plays for consolidation's sake.
Catherine Lesjak: So we did talk -- let me just add, we did talk a little bit about the fact that there could be some very specific markets in some specific countries that could be of interest to us as long as it was kind of in the core areas of emphasis, especially on the Personal Systems side around Commercial.
Dion Weisler: I would add, Katy, that, obviously, there is a lot changing in the market even since the Security Analyst Meeting, on both the personal systems side with Dell-EMC as well as Xerox and Lexmark that presents particular opportunities. And as they evaluate their strategic options, I think customers are generally fairly confused and worried, and we are the pillar of stability right now. And we are going to take full advantage of that.
Operator: Next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: On the HP Inc. side, Lenovo talked about getting more aggressive to take advantage of the disruption, both from the split, your split, and Dell's acquisition of EMC, I presume on both PCs and servers. So I'm wondering if you are already seeing that and that's what you're referring to in terms of the competitive environment or if that's something that you're -- you haven't seen and are expecting. Can you just kind of walk through that?
Dion Weisler: I would say, generally speaking, the PC market continues to be tough and consolidation continues to happen. The big 4 are getting bigger. They're now sort of 62.5% of the total overall market and growing. And I think we've been pretty predictable over the course of the last 2 years, not taking share for shares' sake. We did grow in all 3 regions to 19.7% overall. Commercial share, we grew to 23.7%, and that was our highest ever share position. So we remain very disciplined. We walked away from some sizable Black Friday deals that were not very high calorie or, in fact, negative calorie. So I think we continue to execute as we said we would. We continue to segment the market, drive to where the heat is in the market, drive cost out, make sure our channel inventory and, particularly, aged inventory is well under control. And as we did that, we saw profit margin expansion 0.8 of 1 point sequentially to 3.8%. So we're squarely on strategy here.
Catherine Lesjak: And I would say that we didn't see a disruption. Dion went through the details that show that we didn't see the disruption to our business as a result of the split. That was not a factor in how we met customer needs or in the reception that we got from customers.
Margaret Whitman: And I think, Maynard, you asked about servers. I would say the exact same thing; there was no disruption to customers. I have to say this split was executed nearly flawlessly, and it's a credit to the team across the globe. We've been very successful, actually, at taking server share as the IBM server business migrated over to Lenovo. We've actually been very good at taking share and also gaining formerly -- former IBM channel partners, so we've been very aggressive there. And obviously, as I've talked about, as the Dell-EMC merger creates uncertainty in the marketplace, we, obviously, want to be aggressive there talking about the future of the company, the future of our server business and, of course, the future of storage and networking, which we feel like we're in really great shape. As I said, our innovation engine is humming.
Maynard Um: Okay. And just for my follow-up, for HP Enterprise, I calculate that roughly nearly 3/4 of your profits next fiscal year will be recurring. Are there any dynamics in the transactional businesses that make the cash flow less recurring? Or can we assume that nearly 3/4 of your free cash flow is also recurring?
Tim Stonesifer: I'm sorry. Yes. High level -- at a high level, profitability is recurring so I think you could assume that.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. And I don't think there's anything in the dynamics that are different in 2016 than were different in the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise segments in 2015, except for that TS is getting stronger. So TS is up, Financial Services is an annuity and ES is getting stronger as well. So I would say that, yes, the contracts are getting a bit shorter, but that shouldn't really affect us in 2016.
Operator: Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have one for HP Inc. and one for HP Enterprise, please. On the HP Inc. side, you commented on an incremental currency headwind and you also commented on a fundamentally more challenged Printing business going forward, including supplies which drive the profits, yet, you didn't change your operating EPS guidance for fiscal '16. And I'm wondering why because the commentary, certainly, would have suggested that it should be lower, and what the offsets are.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Toni. So we're taking very decisive actions in order to counterbalance some of the headwinds that we're seeing in the Printing business. And Dion talked a little bit about them in his prepared remarks. I mean we're absolutely maniacally focused on the $1 billion in productivity improvements and making sure that those are getting delivered and, frankly, getting delivered a little bit earlier in the year. We are also trying to change kind of how we approach the market and the market looks at us by really doing a better job from a marketing perspective and a sales perspective so that, in fact, we are not competing on price alone. We've got a lot of value in the products that we bring to market and we think that there's an opportunity there. We also think there is an opportunity to improve our supplies market share position, and so we're taking action around, again, marketing and feet on the street, as well as really going after online. And then, finally, Dion mentioned the fact that we are restructuring our nonrevenue-generating cost base, and we will be aggressively taking cost out of kind of the nonrevenue-generating. We believe that with these actions, that will counterbalance some of the incremental headwind that we saw in the printing market. But clearly, there is now more actions that need to take place in order to deliver the outlook that we provided.
Toni Sacconaghi: And on the HPE side, I was wondering if you could comment on a couple of things. It looked like separation costs had been pushed out from fiscal '15 to fiscal '16. I was wondering if you could comment on the magnitude of that push-out as it relates to HPE. And sort of the same question as with HPI, if you have incremental separation costs in fiscal '16 relative to your expectations, why is cash flow not adjusted? And also, if you could just confirm what the expected impact of the closure of the Chinese JV will be on your EPS and revenue for fiscal '16 and whether that's in your guidance or not?
Tim Stonesifer: Sure. Okay. Let me start out with the cash flow. So from a separation cost, we had about $300 million of favorability from a free cash flow perspective on the E side in '15. $200 million of that will move over to '16. So if you look at the overall amount of separation costs we were able to -- actually, able to work down the overall amount, so there'll be about a $200 million separation cost increase in '16. If you look at the overall free cash flow and the adjustment to '16, we're still holding to the '16 guide. And basically, our shortfall was driven by a couple of things. If you think about the financing volumes were higher in our Financial Services business, as well as we had some pressure on the VAT receivables that we were unable to collect. That will push over and then give us some favorability in '16, which will offset some of the separation cost pressure. So overall, we're sticking to the guide that we provided at SAM. As far as Tsinghua, we haven't adjusted EPS yet because the deal is not closed. But just to give you some color around that, from the remaining 49% that will stick with us, we're going to account for that with the equity accounting method. So you'll see that earnings and cash flow impact flow through the other income line. And then as far as a guide or framing it up from an EPS perspective, we've said historically that we've earned -- we had about $400 million of op profit in that business in 2014, so I think you could use that as a proxy. And then I'd just take a couple of things into account: One would be the timing of the transaction, so when we close it; and then the second thing I would think about is there will be some stranded costs associated with overhead costs that do not go with the transaction. So similar to dis-synergy costs, we will need to work that out of the system and that will take a little bit of time, so that's the Tsinghua impact.
Margaret Whitman: And I would just say that we expect this transaction to close in Q1. We expect to have all the regulatory approvals by December 31.
Operator: Your next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I had a question on the HPE side thinking about the Server business. It's been relatively strong this fiscal year. Can you talk through your expectations? I know you commented you expect it to decelerate somewhat, but do you expect that business to continue to be able to grow in fiscal '16?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, we do. I mean, we are seeing very strong momentum. But that is, in part, driven by the sales to the Tier 1 service providers but also there's very good strength in our core server market with strong options attach that obviously help the margins. And ISS, just the industry standard server portion, has the best ever product line that we've ever had, with Gen9, Cloudline and Apollo, and these are resonating really well with customers and, importantly, are purpose-built for specific workloads. So I think we've talked about how we're taking our Server business to a workload-focused strategy. And as Tim said, ISS grew 5% year-over-year, 13% in local currency, and we expect to gain over 1 point of share in the calendar Q3 of '15. And we -- with a market we think is going to be healthy. And so I think we feel very good about the Server business. And the reason we don't think it'll be quite the revenue year-over-year growth that we saw is that we're starting now to lap very strong compares. But at least, for the foreseeable future, we feel pretty good about servers.
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. And then a question for Dion in terms of the A3 market. You talked about that a lot at the Security Analyst Day. Does anything that's happening now with the printer market mean that, that entry into that market moves out or are you still on your plans to enter that market in about a year?
Dion Weisler: No, we're absolutely on the same course and trajectory that we outlined at the Security Analyst Meeting. We think it represents a strong growth opportunity for our shareholders.
Catherine Lesjak: And I would just add that we are taking decisive action around the core right now. We are not taking our foot off of the accelerator on the core or on the investments that we're making for the kind of the midterm growth areas around commercial mobility, packaging and copier market or for the future around 3D and Immersive Computing.
Dion Weisler: Exactly. Look, kind of said another way, we firmly believe in our strategy. And there's lots of disruption and change in the market at the moment and our competitors are pursuing all sorts of options. We will continue to assess how the markets evolve. We'll get ourselves in fighting shape inside the core, but we'll continue to execute against our strategy.
Operator: Next question is from Steve Milunovich at UBS.
Steven Milunovich: First, I wanted to ask about the profits in the Server business. Obviously, you're pretty bullish on the growth rate, but what's been happening to the margin in ISS? I assume it's been coming down. So have you had and do you expect to have operating profit growth in that segment going forward? And I just wanted a little clarification on when you say Tier 1 providers, are those sort of the big hyperscalers and are you selling them only Cloudline or are you selling them kind of more fully configured servers as well?
Tim Stonesifer: Sure. From a profit perspective, we'd expect margins to be relatively stable actually. There's a lot of work going on in supply chain on the productivity front, so we have various initiatives going on there that will help offset some of the pricing pressures that we're seeing. As well as if you look at Gen9, as Gen9 becomes a bigger piece of the overall portfolio, those margins are also more attractive than what we had with the Gen8.
Margaret Whitman: And as regard to Tier 1, these are the big hyperscalers as you described and they're continuing to grow, and we don't really sell them much other than Cloudline. Now we sell storage often and some networking. But for the server portion, it's mostly Cloudline. And then you immediately drop down into what we call Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 and they buy a much broader mix than just Cloudline. And the other thing, Steve, that I know you know is that, if you look at Enterprise Group in total, obviously, the Storage business, which is doing very well with 3PAR and All-Flash, plus the Networking business is higher margin than the Server business, so the blended average. As we said at the Security Analyst Meeting, EG needs to be the growth engine of the company over the next couple of years with modestly expanding margins, and the margins will expand with the mix shift. And obviously, of course, with the attach rate that is higher on 3PAR and All-Flash.
Steven Milunovich: That's great. And it's good to see you getting some credit for 3PAR flash. We've certainly heard the same thing that it's a terrific product. How about on the solutions side? I think -- obviously, legacy vendors are under attack from a lot of different directions, but you do have a bit of an ace in terms of the completeness of the product line and I've always had some concern that HP is a bit of a piece parts company, but it seems like you have been emphasizing solutions, trying to coordinate the groups more. Are you seeing evidence that customers are beginning to react to that and that's going to put you in a good competitive position?
Margaret Whitman: So we feel really good about our ability to continue the transformation to a solutions-selling company. First of all because we now have a great server, storage, networking, converged offering. But as we move to these 4 transformation areas that we talked about at the Security Analyst Meeting, this is dead-on with customers. I mean, these 4 transformation areas is exactly what virtually every customer is looking for. How do I transform my IT environment to a hybrid environment? How do I secure my digital enterprise? How do I enable analytics, a big data analytics environment? And how do I drive workplace productivity? And we are aligning software services and hardware or infrastructure to that. And this is particularly powerful for software because software now has some of the anchor IP in each of these areas and it's also helping us decide what parts of software we want to be in and what parts we don't. And we talked about LiveVault and TippingPoint. This 4 transformation area gives us a very good portfolio criteria by which to manage that software business. So I think the transformation areas are absolutely right on for customers, and we feel like we've got a pretty good portfolio. And where we have gaps, our first choice will be to do organic innovation; second choice will be around partnering with our Ventures arm; and then finally, would be M&A along the lines of a 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba kind of acquisition.
Operator: Your next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at Credit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: A question for Dion first. On the supplies business, what I think I've heard is the market's a little bit worse, the pricing environment's tough and inventory levels may be high. I guess, can you speak about the visibility you have on each of those items beginning to improve? And then kind of linked to that is that I think, once upon a time, not so long ago, you were saying that the supplies business would stabilize by the middle of this year. Then it was by the end of '16, now it's by the end of '17. So this 4-box model which manages business which is supposed to give this predictability, it doesn't seem that predictable I guess. So my question is how much faith do you have in that continued model about that supplies business eventually turning?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Kulbinder. I guess, I'll start and then I'll throw it to Dion to add any additional comments. We have found that our 4-box model is, in fact, very good. And as we have collected more big data, and every week we collect new data, we update basically the model. What we saw in Q4 were basically 2 things that really impacted the model and impacted when the ink supplies would stabilize and push it out to basically late '17. The first thing was we did see incremental competitiveness in key segments, particularly in SMB ink and, therefore, we placed less units. And as a result of that, that's going to have a knock-on effect around ink supplies. Secondly, what we saw was, through aggressive pricing, we actually took a -- we took a product that should've been sold into 1 end-user, an end-user that, in fact, prints a lot, and we now are getting -- selling that product into home users which just don't print enough. And so we need to change that. And that's part of better managing the marketing, better managing basically the price points. And that has a knock-on effect because those were units that we had expected would be very high usage. So we have a lot of confidence in the model, but you have to work the model all the time and it's across those 4 dimensions that we've talked about, the installed base, usage, aftermarket share and then also making sure that we're careful about what we do from a supplies pricing perspective.
Dion Weisler: Yes, absolutely. The only other things that I would add to that is that we just believe that this is the new normal and we have a lot of faith in our 4-box model; it is an incredibly predictable model. But there are dynamics in the market, competitive dynamics in the market that just our working assumptions need to change around it. It's exactly how it is going to be. And as a result of that, we need to go to the gym, we need to get fit, we need to deal with currency, the way that it's exposing itself in the market and the ramifications it's having on the marketplace and do the 3 things that we talked about, drive those productivity improvements, not fight on price alone, balance marketing and sales and materially go after nonrevenue-generating expenses. When we do that, we can turn marginal MPV units that have slipped into negative back into positive territory and that will then reinform the 4-box model.
Kulbinder Garcha: And maybe just one very quick question for Meg. Meg, as you've separated now into HP Enterprise, what are your thoughts on industry consolidation and the role that HP Enterprise perhaps plays in that?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So listen, obviously, I think one of the things that validates the decision to separate is these markets are changing enormously. I mean Dion talked about a couple of his competitors looking at strategic opportunities. We also, obviously, see the Dell-EMC transaction. What I would tell you is we feel really good about our strategy relative to what we see Dell and EMC doing. I mean, they could not be in more stark contrast. They're getting bigger, leveraging up and doubling down mostly on legacy technology, while our strategy is to get smaller. I've just spent the last 4 years deleveraging the balance sheet and leaning into new technology like converged infrastructure, new server architectures, 3PAR with All-Flash, Aruba, et cetera. So we feel really good about our strategy and our portfolio of assets. And I'll underscore what I said before, these 4 transformation areas is the way we're going to pivot this company to solutions-selling. ES already solution-sells. EG and software are moving rapidly towards that solution of driving business outcomes as opposed to just selling speeds and feeds. And it's a cultural change for this company, but actually I will tell you it's underway and I'm feeling pretty good about it.
Diana Sroka: Thank you, Kulbinder. Operator, we'll take a final question, please.
Operator: The last question is from Jim Suva at Citi.
Jim Suva: Congratulations on your separation. I have 1 question for Meg and 1 question for Dion and/or Cathie. Meg, I believe you've mentioned some of the ES contracts may be getting shorter. Did I hear that correctly? And what does that mean to the profitability as such, the ability to invest in such? It seems like it may compress some of that a little bit, but maybe I'm wrong on that. And then the second -- or the other question for Dion and/or Cathie would be, I think you'd mentioned that you said the PC channel had some elevated inventory. And I believe we heard about this when you were going through the separation and you wanted to have your systems make sure that they converted over, but that was several months ago. So are you referring to excess inventory in the channel from HP or others or both? Or how should we think about that comment? Because I would have thought by now that, that PC inventory or anything due to your separation in the IT conversion cycles would have already right sided themself.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me answer the ES question. So the ES business is changing, and you will recall in the old days, in particularly the ITO part of the business, you would lose money in the first 2 years of the contract, then you'd break even for about 3 years and then you'd make money in the final 4 years. But the only problem with that is then, about year 8, the customer would renegotiate, and you'd miss out on the whole profit of the whole thing. And so really, the markets moved to shorter, more strategic relationships in ITO. As opposed to just labor arbitrage, now there is how do we transform your infrastructure to be more nimble, more agile and lower cost? And we've talked about a number of our customers for whom we're not just taking their mess for less. In the old days, that's probably what we would have done. Now we are saying, "We will help transform your IT environment to be part of this new world order that's going to allow it to be lower-cost, more modern and allow you to be more agile." And those contracts are -- tend to be shorter and we're actually okay with that because we also are very clear now that we're not going to lose money in contracts in years 1 and 2, and these things have to be profitable from the beginning. And that's been a change in the industry and, frankly, a change that we're putting a lot of discipline in. We're very, very focused on only taking deals that are good business for us. And like Dion said in his business, share for share's sake is not interesting to us here. We want to do good, profitable deals with customers that we can drive a good outcome for. And you're seeing that. I mean we said at our analyst meeting, we now have the highest Net Promoter Score in the business, in the Services business. And that, ultimately, and we can see it, is going to translate I think into higher new logos and higher TCV.
Dion Weisler: Okay. And to your question on channel inventories, I'll step back. Going into quarter 4, what I said was industry inventory levels were high and our inventory levels were also high. As we exit Q4, I would say that industry inventory levels are still elevated but somewhat lower than they were as the market has begun to digest the Windows 8 inventory. But our inventory position is now back within the ranges and in good shape with regards to the age profile of that inventory.
Margaret Whitman: Good. All right. Well, thank you, thank you very much to everyone for being on a slightly extended call today because we wanted to make sure we covered the company and then also Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. So thank you very much. And next quarter, we'll be reporting as 2 separate companies. So again, thanks for your support and thanks for a little extended time today.
Tim Stonesifer: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2015 Q3  (2015-08-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Kirt Karros, Treasurer and Investor Relations Leader. Please proceed.
Kirt Karros: Good afternoon. Welcome to our fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining today's call are Dion Weisler and Tim Stonesifer, who post-separation are expected to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc. and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, respectively. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2015. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have included reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thanks, Kirt, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With only 2 months left until our separation, I'm pleased with the progress we've made along many fronts. In the third quarter, we once again did what we said we'd do, delivering non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.88, above our previously provided outlook range. We delivered $856 million in free cash flow, in line with our expectations. And we returned $670 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, all while executing with military precision, one of the largest and most complex separations than had ever been undertaken. By business, we're seeing the benefits of the work we've done over the past several years to strengthen the product strategy and go-to-market execution for the Enterprise Group. Enterprise Group performed very well in Q3, with solid constant currency revenue year-over-year growth across all 3 regions and good momentum in Industry Standard Servers, Storage, Networking and Technology Services support. In Enterprise Services, we're turning the corner in what has been one of the most critical parts of the turnaround. ES significantly improved its sequential revenue trajectory and delivered another quarter of sequential and year-over-year profit improvement. Software performance was mixed with growth in security and IT management SaaS revenue. In Personal Systems and Printing, market declines and competitive pricing pressures have accelerated since May. While Dion and his team are aggressively managing costs and gaining share in key focus areas, we now see a difficult business environment for at least several quarters to come. Turning to the separation. We achieved a number of significant milestones during the past few months. On July 1, we filed the initial Form 10 for Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the SEC. A tremendous amount of work went into the submission, including building 3 years of audited financials for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Earlier this month, we filed the first amendment to the Form 10, which included the pro forma cash and debt levels for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Cathie will talk more about the details of the Form 10 in a minute. On August 1, we successfully split the operations and IT systems for the company. This was an incredibly complex process, and the team executed very well. This separation required working directly with more than 3,500 customers and partners to prepare for the cutover. We successfully separated nearly 750 systems, affecting 95% of our business with no issues. After shutting down for just 3 days to transition, critical operational systems across our business segments are now live globally. Customer orders are flowing through manufacturing, and shipments are in transit across our entire supply chain network. This was a huge accomplishment. Finally, just last week, we introduced the expected members of the Board of Directors for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We handpicked both boards to create the most experienced global-minded members we could find to help each company win in their unique markets. We're very proud of the diversity of these 2 boards and what it says about the importance we place on having people representative of our customer base participate in our decision-making. Turning to our performance in the quarter. Even with the separation process heating up, we remained focused and continued to execute well across the businesses. However, we did face a challenging macroeconomic and IT spending environment in the third quarter, with soft consumer spending, continued weakness in Russia and China and stock market volatility driving uncertainty. Currency continued to significantly impact our reported revenue. Third quarter revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% as reported but down only 2% in constant currency. By business, the momentum in Enterprise Group continued. Constant currency revenue growth was strong, both with and without the impact from the first quarter of Aruba Networks' contribution. In Industry Standard Servers, a strong market, combined with our Gen9 portfolio transition, supported 15% revenue growth in constant currency. We've turned the corner in storage with our newer Converged Storage portfolio now representing more than 50% of the mix. We delivered 7% growth in storage overall in constant currency, with incredible 400% growth in all-flash storage, and we expect this will continue to strengthen our share position as a leader in the market. And the significant moves we've made in networking are already beginning to pay off with a 28% year-over-year constant currency growth, driven by strong performance on all regions except China. Even without Aruba, the business grew mid-single digits in constant currency. The Aruba integration is already driving strong cross-selling opportunities. And with our announcement to partner with Tsinghua University, we delivered sequential improvement in networking -- in our networking business performance in China. As you know, Enterprise Services is a long lead time business, and in Q3, we clearly saw the results of the work the team has been doing over the past 3 years. Revenue continued to stabilize, down just 3% in constant currency, the best constant currency revenue performance since Q3 FY '12. Operating profit improved again, up nearly 2 points year-over-year to 6%. The business continued to make progress migrating to strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT as evidenced by triple digit year-over-year TCV growth and double-digit growth in revenue. In Software, we remained focused on aligning our portfolio to the Hewlett Packard Enterprise strategy and driving software-led integrated solutions across EG and ES while addressing the challenges around the market shift to SaaS and internal execution challenges. We saw growth in key pockets of SaaS solutions as well as security with great early results from our recent acquisition of Voltage. This was offset by weaker Big Data and IT management. The team remained disciplined around cost control and made progress on streamlining the portfolio with the completion of the divestiture of iManage and by moving the marketing optimization business to PPS at the beginning of Q4. Moving to Personal Systems. As you all know, the market was very soft, down 13% year-over-year in calendar Q2, driving fiscal Q3 revenue down 7% in constant currency. There were a number of factors pressuring the market, which we now expect to continue through Q4 and well into the next fiscal year. The market remained competitive, and currency was a continued headwind. In commercial, we had a tough compare with the Windows XP refresh cycle. And in consumer, we faced slightly higher channel inventory levels as customers paused purchasing decisions in anticipation of the Windows 10 launch. Overall, HP remains well positioned in the market. We gained 1 point of share in calendar Q2 and expect consolidation to continue among the top players in this market. We were fast to market with Windows 10, which resulted in strong initial market share, and the early feedback on this operating system has been positive. Similarly, the overall printing market was very soft, with hardware units down 6% year-over-year in calendar Q2. The key challenge we faced this quarter was an acceleration of hardware average selling price erosion, driven by aggressive pricing by our Japanese competitors. But while our Q3 revenue was down, we are pleased with our share performance with units down just 2%. In laser, we gained over 3 points of share year-over-year, achieving 36.9% of the global market, the highest share in 6 years. We attribute some of the success to the R series launch earlier this year as well as continued momentum in our value multifunction printers, which achieved a new high share of 16.6%. In ink jet, we continue to see strength in office print with strong growth in Officejet Pro X units. And Instant Ink, our innovative ink subscription service, has very strong momentum, with significant sequential growth in enrollees and customer retention rates well above our expectations. The economics on this delivery model provide our customers with a competitive value proposition that can't be beat. Customers pay for only what they print and never run out, making it by far the most convenient, flexible and affordable print option out there. As we've said in the past, we are allocating resources to high-growth opportunities, and in Q3, we continued to roll out exciting innovations and win new customers. At HP Discover Las Vegas in June, we announced a strategy for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform 4 critical areas of their enterprise. These 4 areas comprise helping customers move to a hybrid infrastructure that seamlessly brings together traditional IT in the cloud, protecting the digital enterprise, empowering the data-driven organization and, finally, enabling workplace productivity. Collectively, these 4 areas represent more than $1 trillion in total available market where Hewlett Packard Enterprise is uniquely positioned to win. Aligned with these focus areas, we announced new partnerships and enhancements to our storage, converged data center infrastructure, cloud and software portfolios. For example, we announced the latest HP 3PAR StoreServ Storage family, including a new class of flash services to accelerate IT as a Service consolidation and hybrid IT initiatives. Also, at Discover Las Vegas, over 30 customers and partners showcased their success with HP Helion Cloud, providing a strong testament into how far we've come since launching HP Helion just a year earlier. Caterpillar, Del Monte and GE were among the customers that discussed positive business outcomes with HP Helion on stage. At the event, we also announced HP Helion CloudSystem 9, bringing together our industry-leading private cloud solution with HP Helion OpenStack and the HP Helion Development Platform. CloudSystem 9 provides customers an enterprise-grade open source platform for cloud-native application development and infrastructure. And in July, we acquired Stackato, an enterprise-ready Platform-as-a-Service solution with Cloud Foundry at its core. Stackato gives HP a more complete cloud offering and will enhance the HP Helion Development Platform by enabling customers to bring applications to market faster. Continuing our commitment to enable increased adoption of the emerging network function virtualization or NFV market, last month, we announced a collaboration with NEC to create more open environments for customers, meeting their desire for faster deployment at a lower cost. HP also acquired ConteXtream, which offers solutions that allow service providers to create a more flexible and programmable networks through NFV. ConteXtream's open SDN Controller platform complements HP's NFV expertise and telecommunications and IT experience and is already deployed at a number of major carrier networks across the globe. In Enterprise Services, we introduced a full suite of Windows 10 Services that give HP the most comprehensive portfolio of services available for the Microsoft ecosystem. The Enterprise Services team also signed some significant deals in the quarter, including a major deal with the U.K. Ministry of Defence to serve as prime contractor and system integrator for a secure system that will improve its ability to react to humanitarian and defense crises worldwide. Personal Systems rolled out a new Windows 10 tablet and new ENVY notebooks that combine great battery life in a thinner, curved design. We also announced new 3D scanning capability for Sprout by HP, the world's first immersive computer. This will make Sprout the first fully integrated desktop 3D scanning solution for consumers. So overall, I'm pleased with our progress across many key areas despite a very challenging market backdrop for PCs and print and some of our other businesses. We're executing well, innovating and gaining share in key areas, all while delivering on our separation time line. This is a major accomplishment, and I want to thank all of the HP employees who are making it happen. I also want to thank our customers and partners for their ongoing faith in us. We couldn't be successful without their support. And now I'll turn it over to Cathie.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, I feel good about our performance in Q3, even amidst market softness in some parts of the portfolio and continued year-over-year headwinds from unfavorable currency. Revenue of $25.3 billion was down 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency, with declines in all regions and particular weakness in EMEA. The 6-point gap between as reported and constant currency revenue performance is wider than prior quarters as the financial hedges are rolling off. Our gross margin of 23.8% was down 0.2 points year-over-year and 0.2 points sequentially in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 10% year-over-year, with reductions in SG&A primarily due to currency, only partially offset by increased investment in R&D. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.6% was up 0.1 point year-over-year and flat sequentially. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.88, above the high end of our outlook range. About $0.02 was a result of incremental channel business we would have otherwise expected to do in Q4 as we derisked our IT separation cutover by making sure the channel had what it needed when our systems were down in early August. Our non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $401 million for separation, $242 million for amortization of intangible assets and additional noncash charges of $136 million for an Enterprise Services data center impairment and $114 million for a onetime pension adjustment. GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.47 was below our previously provided outlook range of $0.50 to $0.54, primarily due to the ES data center impairment, which was not considered in our outlook. We are nearing the end of our 2012 restructuring program, and 3,900 people exited in Q3. By the end of Q4, we expect to exceed our prior estimate of 55,000 people to exit the company by up to 5%, but we'll not exceed the forecasted GAAP-only charges. Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems revenue declined 13% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency, with an 11% decline in units. However, we grew our worldwide market share to 18.9% as the market continued to consolidate. Currency remained a significant headwind for this business, although we managed to offset about half of the ASP impact with price adjustments, mix and the strength in option attach. Profitability declined 1 point year-over-year to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency net of repricing, partially offset by the strength of the commercial business, commodity cost savings and other operational improvements. Sequentially, the favorable commercial mix offset the net currency headwind, leaving margins flat. In a tough market, our performance in commercial was solid. Commercial revenue declined 9% year-over-year or down just 2% in constant currency. However, we gained 1 point of share, achieving 22.7% market share and maintained our #1 position worldwide. We saw pockets of strength with growth in commercial notebooks, mobile workstations, commercial services and retail solution. Consumer performance was weaker, with Q3 revenue down 22% year-over-year or down 17% in constant currency. The overall market was highly competitive. However, our overall consumer market share was roughly flat with share gains in key areas, including the premium consumer segment. Looking forward, while we see continued market headwinds for several quarters to come, we also see opportunity in the market long term with our strength in commercial and Windows 10 as a catalyst for demand especially in consumer. In Print, revenue declined 9% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. As in prior quarters, the currency impact is somewhat smaller for printing due to the hedges we had in place for this business but has widened about 1 point sequentially as the hedges are rolling off. While the market was tough overall, we performed better than the market in our areas of focus. We gained 3 points of share in laser hardware overall, achieving our highest ever share in value multifunction printers. While we lost a fraction of a point of share in inkjet, we grew SMB hardware units double digits year-over-year and continued to see very positive momentum in our Instant Ink program. And graphics continue to be a bright spot of profitable growth, with Indigo achieving 57% market share. We maintained good profitability in Q3 with an operating margin of 17.8%, down 0.6 points from the prior year. Gross margins were pressured by a highly competitive pricing environment, only partially offset by favorable supplies mix of 67.6%. Also, OpEx was down year-over-year, helped by the Snapfish sale. Channel inventory for hardware and supplies was above our desired ranges due to expected business continuity planning around the separation as well as softer-than-expected market demand. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in Q4. Looking forward, we expect printing headwinds to also continue longer term, particularly the competitive pricing on hardware, but we will continue to focus on stabilizing supplies revenue through strategic placement of high-value hardware units with greater supplies attach. We also plan to increase sales focus on alternative consumption models particularly for consumers. For example, as Meg described earlier, Instant Ink delivers a superior experience at better value for our customers with economics that make sense for HP. With Instant Ink planned to be available on all WiFi-enabled inkjet printers this fall we expect this service to continue to gain traction and drive improved consumer sales overall. Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue grew 2% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency with strength in ISS, storage and networking. Profitability remains solid at 13%, down 1 point year-over-year, primarily due to the strength of Industry Standard Servers and currency. Industry Standard Servers revenue grew 8% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency with strong sales execution and continued product innovation. Margins were somewhat pressured as good option attach was offset by currency and the strength in density optimized servers. Going forward, we are well positioned to finish the year strong, given backlog levels and the continued market momentum. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 21% year-over-year or 15% in constant currency. We continue to develop our mission-critical portfolio to address customers' most critical workloads and are seeing positive momentum with new x86 platforms like Superdome X and NonStop X. Storage had a strong quarter with revenue down 2% or up 7% in constant currency. 18% year-over-year constant currency growth drove Converged Storage past the inflection point, and it now makes up more than 50% of the storage portfolio. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA grew 13% in constant currency. All-flash 3PAR revenue continued to drive the mid-range and led growth in the converged portfolio. Overall, we gained share again in the external disk drive market and expect storage to be a growth driver in constant currency in Q4. Networking also had a good quarter. Revenue grew 22% year-over-year or 28% in constant currency. When adjusted for Aruba, networking reported revenue was down slightly year-over-year but up mid-single digits in constant currency. Our focus on execution is showing up in improved performance across all regions. And the integration of Aruba is driving pipeline growth through cross-selling across campus wireless solutions, which we expect to continue to drive sales for a strong Q4. Technology Services declined 9% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency, although support orders were up year-over-year in constant currency again this quarter and profitability remained good. We are seeing continued adoption of our new portfolio, including Datacenter Care and Proactive Care, and expect TS to continue to stabilize with improving hardware sales. Enterprise Services continued to improve their performance this quarter. Revenue showed progress, declining 11% year-over-year but only 3% in constant currency. We continued to transform our account base in our portfolio. As a result, excluding the top 3 key account runoff, revenue grew year-over-year in constant currency, and strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew double digits. Signings were strong in this quarter with overall year-over-year growth, driven by strength in both SCS and new logos, with win rates for each up double digits year-over-year. Profitability also improved, with Q3 operating profit reaching 6%, up 1.9 points year-over-year. The team continued to execute productivity improvements in excess of key account runoff and contractual pricing concessions. Looking forward, with the progress we've made on cost improvements as well as normal quarterly seasonality, we are confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%. As mentioned on the Q2 earnings call, we see further opportunities to take costs out of this business and are working on the detailed plans which we intend to share at our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15. On revenue for fiscal '15, this quarter was a good proof point in our ability to exit the year down 4% to 6% in constant currency. Software revenue declined 6% year-over-year or 1% in constant currency as growth in security was offset by declines in IT management and Big Data. The team continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, reducing operating expenses year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. However, top line currency pressure drove an operating profit margin of 20.6%, down 0.6 points year-over-year. Overall, in Q4, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year as reported but grew 3% in constant currency. Financing volume was down 2% nominally but up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. And return on equity was 15.3%. HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP and central to our strategy, providing our customers with the flexible pricing models they need to move to the New Style of IT. Turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $1.67 billion, down 54% year-over-year, primarily due to strong working capital improvement in the prior year period. Free cash flow was $856 million, in line with our expectations. In Q4, we expect larger cash outflows associated with the separation, primarily due to incremental taxes. However, we also expect other assets and liabilities to be a significant source of cash. Therefore, we are holding our free cash flow outlook for the year at $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Our Q3 cash conversion cycle was 4 days, flat sequentially. This was broadly in line with normal sequential seasonality, except for day sales outstanding, which were impacted by unfavorable sales linearity. The year-over-year reduction was driven by a 7-day improvement in DPO, a day better than DSO, partially offset by a 4-day increase in DOI. As discussed, inventory was elevated late in the quarter due to business continuity planning associated with the internal systems separation date of August 1. During the quarter, we repurchased $352 million of shares and paid $318 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $670 million. We will return significantly more than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders this year, even with the adjustment in Q1 for the shortfall last year. Turning to the separation. As Meg discussed, we hit a number of key milestones and remain on track to officially separate on November 1. Q3 charges associated with the separation were $401 million. The total multiyear separation cash expenses are expected to be in line with the original forecast we provided on the Q1 earnings call. On August 10, we filed our first amendment to the Form 10. The most significant new disclosure in the filing was the Hewlett Packard Enterprise capital structure. As stated at the separation announcement, our goal was to split the debt and cash balances such that each company will achieve an investment grade rating. And based on the announcements made by the credit rating agencies to date, we are pleased that this is the outcome. As part of the usual process for the Form 10, you can expect additional amendments to be filed until Form 10 is declared effective close to the separation date. And as a reminder, we will be holding our Security Analyst Meeting on September 15 to share more details about each company, including the FY '16 financial outlook. Turning to our outlook. For fiscal '15, our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is $3.59 to $3.65. GAAP outlook for the full year is $1.87 to $1.93. This excludes a likely onetime noncash benefit in Q4 from certain changes to our legal structure that we expect to complete in connection with the separation. As we separate entities, we are evaluating existing and previously reserved against deferred tax assets. The details of these changes are being finalized, but they may result in an increase to deferred tax assets of approximately $1 billion to $1.6 billion. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: On your free cash flow guidance, can you just talk about where the big areas of cash inflow will be? Because you'll need to generate about $2 billion to $2.5 billion to reach your full year target. And then looking into fiscal '16, would it be fair to say that the cash conversion cycle improvements over the last couple of years has largely come from the PC side of the house? And I'm asking that because if you look at Hewlett Packard Enterprise's balance sheet metrics from the Form 10, it would seem you have room for some meaningful improvements when compared to some of your competitors, for example, in your DSO, and I'm just wondering if you've begun the process of identifying those opportunities on the HPE side to improve your cash flow.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks. So let me address the last question first and tell you that the improvement in the cash conversion cycle over the last couple of years has been broad-based. It has not just been the PC group. There have been improvements in PCs, there's been improvement in IPG and there's been improvement in EG. And so I don't think it's really skewed one direction. In terms of your question around the cash flow in Q4, let's start with the fact that in Q3, the free cash flow of $856 million was in line with our expectations. And so we believe we're on track to do the $3.5 billion to $4 billion in free cash flow for the year. Q4 is typically, as I'm sure you're aware, seasonally our stronger quarter from an earnings perspective and a cash flow perspective, but we do have some inflows and outflows that maybe are a little less typical. First, we've got the increase in separation costs, which are really driven by the incremental taxes that we need to pay as we're separating legal entities around the world. And then if you look at -- in my prepared remarks, I talked about business continuity planning, and it had really 2 impacts. One, it -- we basically put more into the channel, so our channel inventory levels are a bit higher. But that was done late in the quarter, so that drove DSO to be a bit higher because of the unfavorable sales linearity. That, of course, will turn around a bit. We also put -- had more inventory as a result of derisking the IT cutover, and that was largely offset by DPO. So you can look at that as kind of a wash. But we would expect that the accounts receivable now would get collected earlier in Q4 and, therefore, would be a nice tailwind for us. And then finally, probably the biggest impact, is really in other assets and other liabilities. As we talked about at the end of I think Q1 and Q2, we had a very significant use of cash in other assets and other liabilities. And we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, a significant portion of that would reverse, that it was really timing. We saw a little bit of that in Q3, and we expect a pretty significant source of cash from other assets and other liabilities in Q4 that then supports our outlook of free cash flow of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for the year in total.
Operator: The next question is from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Your Q4 guidance for EPS is lower. So you beat on your -- relative to your Q3 guidance on EPS, and yet you lowered to the low end of your full year range for the full year, implying a much weaker Q4 than consensus had been expecting and certainly the mid-range of your guidance had been pointing to. Can you comment on what's driving that? And is part of it elevated inventory levels, which you talked about on the last earnings call and reiterated again this call? Or what is it that is causing this relatively material shortfall relative to your expectations for Q4? And I have a follow-up, please.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Toni. So our Q4 outlook for EPS is $0.92 to $0.98, and it is below what you would consider normal seasonality. If you adjust for the $0.02 that we shipped in Q3 that we otherwise would have shipped in Q4, it's more in line. But to your point, the outlook definitely reflects the change in inventory levels. We are going to bring channel inventory levels back down. It reflects the currency headwinds that we're getting both because of hedges that are coming off and just the currency headwind -- the indirect currency headwind of a very competitive pricing environment in IPG as our Japanese competitors take their -- the weak yen against both the euro and the dollar and really price aggressively. And then it also takes into consideration the softness that we're seeing in the PC market. And in terms of the year, just to make sure everyone's clear on this, we did narrow our range to $3.59 to $3.65, just because, of course, we just have 1 quarter left in the year.
Toni Sacconaghi: And then, Cathie, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about operating margins in the Enterprise Group. I know you talked about it sort of being reflective of mix towards Industry Standard Servers, but it's the lowest operating margin in 5.5 years. You had a pretty big sequential volume improvement in the quarter, and it wasn't all ISS. And so -- and currency didn't change that much sequentially either. So I feel like there's something more there that's pressuring margins in that business, and I was hoping you can comment on that, please.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, Tony. I think I'm going to throw that one to Tim Stonesifer to address.
Tim Stonesifer: Sure. So overall, we thought that EG performance was -- I'm not on? Sorry. So overall, we thought EG performance for the third quarter was pretty good, too. On the revenue front, to Cathie's earlier comments, revenue was up 15% on local currency in ISS. We were up 7% in storage on a local currency. Meg alluded to the progress on 3PAR and all-flash. And networking, excluding Aruba, was up low single digits as well. So from a revenue perspective, we felt very good about that. To your point, there was some margin pressure. And when you look at it year-over-year, the increased volumes in ISS definitely put some pressure on the margin front, given that the margins in ISS are lower than storage and networking. And that was primarily driven by Tier 1. And then foreign exchange obviously played an impact in that. When you look at it quarter-over-quarter, OpEx was up a little bit quarter-over-quarter as we continue to invest in R&D and our sales motion. And then on the ISS front, there are some increased pricing pressure particularly in China. So that's what drove the delta there.
Operator: The next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: So I was hoping you could give us a little more detail on what you're seeing on the storage side. You saw really strong strength in the flash business. And Meg, I think you mentioned that Converged is now 50% of Storage. What type of growth are you expecting in that business now that Converged is bigger? And why do you think you guys are doing so well in the flash side?
Margaret Whitman: So I think what you're seeing is a lot of the hard work that's been done over a number of years. These businesses are longer lead time businesses, so whether it's all-flash storage array product, the go-to-market motion that we began to hone 3 or 4 years ago. And then, frankly, Manish Goel, who is the new Head of our Storage business, has done a fantastic job. And as I said, you called it out really well, we've turned the corner with the, faster-growing Converged. 3PAR is fulfilling the promise that we've all known 3PAR's had for many, many years. And the all-flash arrays are seeing incredible growth and driving the mid-range 3PAR Converged portfolio with about 30% of the mix. So listen, we're feeling good about this business. We've got good momentum, and I think you're going to see continued strength here over the next few quarters.
Catherine Lesjak: So I would add that if you look at Converged Storage, it grew 18% on a constant currency basis year-over-year. With that now being bigger than more than 50% of the portfolio, you should see pretty significant opportunity for growth.
Margaret Whitman: I mean, I think you've all heard us talk about that we have businesses where the declining businesses have been bigger than the growing businesses. We're now rounding the corner where the growing businesses are bigger than the declining businesses, which is actually going to lead to growth. And boy, that has taken a while to get here, but we're here. And I think that sets Hewlett Packard Enterprise up pretty well as we think about growth going forward.
Catherine Lesjak: And actually, I think there's another data point that I probably should give out, and that's the one in my prepared remarks. I talked about 3PAR plus EVA plus XP, because in large cases, 3PAR is, in fact, cannibalizing EVA and, in some instances, XP, and that grew 13% in local currency. So there's a lot of great data points here that storage should be a growth engine going forward for the company.
Sherri Scribner: Okay, great. And then, Cathie, I just wanted a little more detail on the hedges. You mentioned them rolling off. How should we think about hedges going forward?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think the best way to think about the hedges is that for the most of our businesses, the hedges are largely already run off. And so we're putting new hedges on at basically today's exchange rate. But in the case of IPG, we hedged a little bit longer from a supplies [ph] perspective. And that's why you see a much narrower range between as reported and constant currency in IPG. And if you looked at it at the supplies level, there's almost no gap between the two. And we've had -- those hedges are running off. And I guess I take -- if you go back and you look at the 10-Q for Q2, you will see in the currency section the fact that our cash flow hedges running off have been driving about over $800 million of profit in the first half of the year. Those are the hedges that were in the first half. We've still got some that have come off in Q3 and a few more that come off in Q4. By the end of the year, we should largely be at kind of today's currency rates with our hedges.
Operator: The next question is from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: As we look forward beyond separation, tax, CapEx costs related to the separation and think about more sustainable cash flow, how should we think about restructuring costs specifically? If you look past 7 years, you've had $1 billion, give or take, just about every year of outflows from restructuring. Is there any discussion or stated goal internally to get back to a point that restructuring is not such a headwind?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, there is a goal to reduce restructuring on a go-forward basis, and we're going to talk a lot more about this at the Security Analyst Meeting. But the view is that the restructuring that we have talked about is potential, where we will provide more details. But that will be, at least for the Enterprise Services business, the last restructuring that we do. We are setting that business up so that it has sustainable 7% to 9% operating margin, but it also then, in its ordinary course of business, can fund the refinement that it needs to do with its workforce. So in essence, the restructuring charges that are at the corporate level, that are fundamentally restructuring the cost base by getting the labor pyramid right and the offshore mix correct, will be done. And that then it's the fine-tuning of what's going on in the course of the year, the contracts that win, the contracts that we don't win kind of get factored in, and that will be funded within the P&L, the non-GAAP P&L of ES.
Kathryn Huberty: And that's also true outside of Enterprise Services?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. I mean, I think from a restructuring perspective, Katy, it's Meg -- Cathie described is we recognize that Enterprise Services has to fund, over time, its -- the fine-tuning, as Cathie said, of its workforce. And we are -- we're going to show you that walk as we get to Security Analyst Meeting. This will be the last restructuring for Enterprise Services. And then as we said, we've got to offset some of the dis-synergies, and there may be a smaller restructuring associated with that. But we are working the final details. As we see the momentum of the business, as we see where we're growing, where we need to move our labor structure around, we're going to give you a lot of detail on that because we know it's been a concern, and frankly, it's been a concern to us. And so this will be the last of the restructuring Mohicans this year.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, you sound much more constructive on the enterprise server market over the next couple of quarters relative to some of your partners and suppliers that have reported. Can you just talk about where that confidence comes from?
Margaret Whitman: I think it comes from a couple of places. One is our innovation engine is as strong as it has ever been in servers. Gen9 is definitely a winner. Our HP Apollo high-performance compute line is fantastic. We're back in the game and even some of the more basic rack and tower. And then, of course, our cloud line offering, density optimized servers for Tier 1, Tier 2 service providers with Foxconn, is totally the right thing to do, and we make money in that business. So I think we've got the right innovation engine. We've also refined our go-to-market over a longer period of time. And part of the challenge we had prior to me was the fact that we changed our go-to-market so many times. Every CEO had a different idea about how to go to market. We've just locked on one and we're driving it. There might be things we can do to optimize it, but we've got a strategy and we're driving it. And I think that's given the sales force and customers a lot of confidence. And we've all been out with a lot of customers. The first couple of years was sort of more internally focused. We've been out with customers. I would say our customer and partner confidence is at an all-time high. So -- and the backlog, by the way, going into fourth quarter is the highest backlog I've had since I've been at the company. So all signs are good, but we remain on constant alert. This market changes at the drop of a hat. You have a currency shock, you have some other problem and it can dissipate. But we're feeling really very good about the server business and, frankly, EG overall. Even in TS, you saw that orders are positive in a constant currency basis, and that's been that way for a couple of quarters. So we feel really good about that. And as the hardware business grows, there's more to attach to, which gives us that profit associated with TS.
Operator: Next question is from Kulbinder Garcha at CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: My first question is for Cathie on free cash flow. Just in the fourth quarter, the movement of assets and liabilities, can you be more specific in terms of what's generating so much cash and what's reversing over the course of the year? That's my first question. The second one is on free cash flow as well actually is that this year, there's a number of items are kind of nonrecurring, some of them have been and some of them haven't, in terms of what's depressing free cash flow, whether it's the restructurings in the fiscal year '12 on the separation costs, the separation CapEx, foreign taxes, plus there may be some impact from the 2 new restructuring programs you discussed last quarter. I put that number somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion depressing this year's free cash flow. What I'm curious about is how quickly does that drop in coming years. And if you're not going to answer that now, which I imagine you're not, is that the kind of information we will get at the Security Analyst Meeting?
Catherine Lesjak: So I'll take the last question first. Yes, that will be more information that we'll provide at the Security Analyst Meeting for each company in terms of what the free cash flow should look like for '16, and then you'll see some of the nonrecurring items kind of in that bridge. In terms of the other assets and other liabilities, Kulbinder, it isn't any one thing that turns around. It's that the number of items that have -- are just kind of ordinary course of business have been a headwind and that -- I mean, an example is that the accounts -- the vendor receivables. At the end of Q3, our vendor rebate receivables was high. We knew that, that would turn around. That's ordinary course of business that it would turn around because we collect those receivables. And it's those kinds of items across a number of different line items that are turning around just in ordinary course in Q4 in other assets and other liabilities. And as I said, we did see some of that in Q3 as well.
Kulbinder Garcha: Great. Just one more thing, if I may, just on the Printing side. The revenues are weaker, but the margins held in quite well. They haven't quite come down in the manner that you've been implying all year long. Can you speak about what's supporting them?
Catherine Lesjak: Can you repeat the question one more time? We sort of -- you were a little muffled at the beginning. I think the operator might have been trying to cut you off. Can you start at the top on that question?
Kulbinder Garcha: Yes. Sorry. My question was on the Printing. The Printing revenues were a bit weaker than we expected. I understand that pressure may last for some time. But my -- the actual margin, the percentage margin is holding in quite well. Are you able to sustain that level of constant currency declines and keep the margin higher level in the 17% to 18% range? Or do you still expect that to come down at some point?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me help you understand the year-over-year change in operating margins for Printing. As we talked about, the #1 headwind that helped drive the decline year-over-year was really the competitive pricing environment. And this is a situation where while we get benefit from the weakness in the yen, we get that benefit on our cost structure on a piece of our Printing business. Our Japanese competitors get the weakness of the yen and that kind of war chest across their entire print portfolio. So competitive pricing has really driven basically ASP declines, very material ASP declines both on a year-over-year basis and sequentially. So that has increased in aggressiveness. That's partially offset this quarter in the fact that the supplies mix is at roughly 68%, up 2 points on a year-over-year basis. We had good strength. We've had growth in graphics, then we had good profitability in graphics. We also had a favorable mix impact because we have less home units in the ink space. And then like I said, we have the yen weakness as well. What's really important in this business, when you think about margins over the long term, is we've got to have the right cost structure, and then we have continue to place profitable units because that's what's going to drive the long-term success of -- and health of this business. And I don't know, Dion, if you would add anything else there.
Dion Weisler: Yes. I think -- there's obviously a few initiatives that we remain extremely focused on. And one is accelerating our new and innovative business model around Instant Ink, and that, to remind everybody, is a subscription-based model. And it has a terrific value proposition for customer, has up to sort of 50% savings and the convenience of never running out of ink. And it's a terrific value proposition. And that is beginning to take hold as we ramp and accelerate the number of subscriptions that we build. The second is our focus on SMB and, in particular, the higher end of SMB with Officejet Pro X, which, of course, has terrific supplies attach associated with it. And that leverages off our very unique PageWide Array Technology. And the third is, as you remember, about a little over 4 months ago, we released our jet intelligence or what we internally call our R series LaserJet products, and that's been 8 years in the making of a new platform, which has a higher aftermarket supplies attach. And so we continue to remain really focused around those initiatives as well as the general initiative of shifting from transactional motions to contractual motions with managed print services, which adds significant value to our customers.
Catherine Lesjak: And one of the things I would just add on that Instant Ink, it has a great value proposition for our customers, as Dion talked about. It also has attractive economics for Hewlett-Packard, and I think that, that's also very important to understand.
Operator: Next question is from Shannon Cross at Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Dion, I had a question for you on the PC side. Can you talk a bit about how you're thinking about balancing profitability versus market share and placement of units and how we should think about that given the weak end demand?
Dion Weisler: Yes, look, I guess my strategy there has not changed since we were talking at SAM several years ago. We're not chasing share for share's sake, and we're very selective about what are valuable units, what we can attach around. And in a very challenging PC market, that is absolutely the right thing to do. There is some fairly significant headwinds. And so when I break that down, Shannon, and I think about sort of consumer and commercial, there's some parts of the consumer market that are not terribly interesting, empty calorie business. And we're not terribly interested in placing units there. But we've been doing pretty well in the premium segment, where we've been taking share in the higher priced bands. And we segment the market and heat map the market fairly significantly. We did anticipate a challenging operating system transition to Windows 10 on 2 dimensions: One was a free upgrade that was, of course, offered. And the second was the very short transition time, which is normally about 3 months, which is compressed to under 1 month. And what that drove was fairly high Windows 8 channel inventory levels, and that will take a little bit of time to flush. I guess the good news is that the Windows 10 feedback is pretty good, and a great operating system is important for the ecosystem and the industry. So once Window 8 flushes, which may take a little time here in the industry, we should see some stimulation from Windows 10. Commercial, of course, is a little simpler to understand. The compares are tough. This was the peak last year of the Windows XP transition. But that drives higher profitable units for us, and we are clearly focused on that.
Margaret Whitman: I'd clarify that it's not our Windows 8 inventory that has to flush through. We're running nice inventories at Windows 8. So...
Dion Weisler: Yes. Look, I think in general, that's an industry statement. If you were to look across by old reports, Windows 8 channel inventory levels are high, and they are on the higher side for us well. But we're, as an industry, looking at having to flush through 8 before 10 really takes hold.
Catherine Lesjak: And before we move on, the bright spot that Dion mentioned around the consumer -- the premium consumer segment, this calendar Q2, we gained 4 points of share with our Spectre x360. So that is -- that's been a long time coming in and a really nice result to continue to have a great product set in that space.
Shannon Cross: Great. And then just a question on China. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of end demand and competitive pressures, not just in PCs but across the portfolio?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, I'll start first and then turn it over to Dion. So China remains a very big and important market for us, but it is very competitive. And -- but I will say, our joint venture with Tsinghua is actually standing us in very good stead. We had an excellent quarter in servers in China, quite a good quarter in storage and a sequential improvement in networking in China. And so listen, it's a very competitive market by local competitors, by international competitors, but we're convinced that our strategy around the JV with Tsinghua is the right thing to do. And we're already seeing some benefits on just the basis of the announcement.
Dion Weisler: And I'd say for Printing and Personal Systems, Personal Systems particularly the consumer segment, is pretty soft. The commercial segment, whilst it's not overwhelming, is not as contracted as what the consumer market is. The printing market is -- has been softer than traditionally it's been, so we continue to watch the market with interest. We're very interested in the work that Meg and the team have done with Tsinghua University. We think that is a pretty interesting model.
Operator: Our final question comes from Aaron Rakers at Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: The first question I wanted to ask is going back to the enterprise business. Just curious, as we think about the separate entities, how the company thinks about the Technology Services piece, particularly as it relates to the fact that you've talked about positive growth on the order side. We've seen some positive trends on the hardware side. However, the reported growth on a year-over-year basis continues to decelerate. So when do you expect that actually to start to turn positive? And how are we thinking about the margin profile of that piece of the portfolio?
Margaret Whitman: So let me tell you, so Technology Services is the crown jewel of enterprise growth. This is one great business, but there is a lag to this. And part of what you're seeing in as reported revenues is the currency issue. But frankly, as you saw our Enterprise Group revenues decline in '12, '13 and '14, that has a knock-on effect with Technology Services attach. The other problem is there was very high technology services attach to our Business Critical Systems, Itanium for one. So we are recovering from that. What I have to say is the team, led by Antonio Neri when he ran Technology Services, is he has done a remarkable job in creating products, like Proactive Care, Datacenter Care, that are actually filling the vacuum that was left by Itanium and a downward decline in Enterprise Group hardware revenues. So you're now, pretty soon, just like in storage, you're going to see a shift now to actually as reported growth in Technology Services because the new products are kicking in, the attach rate is at very good levels and now we have hardware growing again. So we feel pretty good about the underlying financial architecture associated with Enterprise Group. And Technology Services has not only great financial characteristics, virtually, every customer needs to attach technology services, so they have that ability to service their hardware in their data center real time with the biggest footprint of services individuals around the world.
Aaron Rakers: And then as a follow-up and a follow-up to a prior question, as HP looks forward, how is HP looking at the PC overall industry in terms of growth rate or, for that matter, declines over the next couple of quarters? What is the assumption for the industry?
Dion Weisler: Look, broadly speaking, our view is not dissimilar to the industry analysts. We think it will be challenging for the next several quarters. We're generally aligned with the industry on that. We see it being down high single digits versus only sort of negative 2 last year, driven by the XP refresh. We see notebooks being stronger than desktops. We see opportunity in commercial mobility, in accessories, in services. And the market to me at the moment reminds me a little bit of the market in 2013. And it really requires a highly disciplined approach to market segmentation, cost optimization, leveraging the 160,000 channel partners that we have around the globe that do an amazing job of adding value to our customer set and continuing to drive our innovation agenda. We remain disciplined about not chasing share for share's sake, playing where we choose to play and winning in those segments. And we are in a consolidating market. And inside that consolidating market, we are growing faster than the market. And if we do that in a very disciplined way, we still see opportunity in the longer term for the Personal Systems business.
Margaret Whitman: But I think you've said, Dion, that the next couple of quarters are probably going to be simply tough.
Dion Weisler: Indeed, indeed.
Margaret Whitman: I mean, the next several quarters, we think, are going to be pretty tough.
Dion Weisler: It's pretty challenging right there, right now, as I mentioned earlier.
Kirt Karros: Thanks, Aaron, and thank you, everybody, for joining today's call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-05-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2015 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amy, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Bergkamp, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Jim Bergkamp: Good afternoon. Welcome to our fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thanks, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first half of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I'm pleased to report that, once again, we delivered the results we said we would. We executed well in a tough market environment, and in Q2, we delivered non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.87, at the high end of our previously provided outlook range. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion. Free cash flow was approximately $800 million. And we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In the quarter, we executed well across Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, Personal Systems and graphics, and Enterprise Services improved profitability. We continued to invest in innovation across the company and improve our go-to-market approach. At the same time, we faced significant market challenges due to currency movements, softness in PCs, home printing and IT outsourcing markets and execution challenges in pockets of the business that require more work. But overall, I'm pleased with our progress and the turnaround. Turning to the separation. As you will recall, last October, we announced our plan to separate HP into 2 independent Fortune 50 companies. Today, I'm more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do. Over the past 6 months, we've seen the markets continue to shift and evolve at a rapid pace. In Hewlett Packard Enterprise, our customers are demanding services and solutions that will help them manage traditional IT better, while planning their journey to a hybrid infrastructure. And we need to move faster and smarter to meet that demand. At HP Inc., we will contain engineering multi-OS devices and immersive computing experiences for business and consumer and ink- and laser-based solutions that provide a faster, more affordable, exciting way to print, manage and deliver content, all while continuing to invest in strategic areas like 3D printing. The separation will enable us to do that. Since October, we've made substantial progress across a number of areas that gives me confidence that we'll complete the separation by the end of our fiscal year. We've completed the leadership and organizational structures for each company and largely completed our workforce assignments. We've made progress in recruiting new board members for each company. We've evaluated how we can best meet customer needs, and as a result, have planned a new, optimized, partner-driven go-to-market approach in over 50 global markets. Our real estate teams have made decisions about our sites around the world, and we've performed thousands of hours of IT system testing ahead of the separation. We've also announced a new brand that represents the future for Hewlett Packard Enterprise, all of that while continuing to deliver on our commitments in terms of FY '15 business performance. As I've said before, one benefit of our separation is that the disciplined process of reviewing every aspect of the new companies is uncovering opportunities to take costs out and improve the way we do business. Even at this early stage, each new organization is optimizing for the realities of their markets and unique competitive sets. As we dive deep into the planned organizations, we've identified both dis-synergies required to run separate companies, as well as opportunities to streamline our processes and ultimately improve both cost structures. Cathie will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we estimate that the total dis-synergies associated with the separation will be approximately $400 million to $450 million annually, divided about equally between the 2 companies. And we believe we can offset more than half of these dis-synergy costs in fiscal year 2016 and more than fully offset these costs by fiscal year 2017. As separate companies, we'll have sharper focus on the markets we serve, the ability to adapt and shift more quickly and a tighter linkage between rewards and results. And I can already see this beginning to take hold across HP. There's a greater feeling of accountability, and I'm seeing strong execution and more disciplined cost management. We're also continuing to make smart moves to set Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. up for success. Over the first half of this year, we've done a number of small transactions, including the acquisition of Voltage, a data security provider that complements our existing information security and encryption business, and the announced divestiture of Snapfish, the online photo-sharing platform. Just this week, we closed on the acquisition of Aruba, and I'm really excited about combining our networking portfolio and broad channel with Aruba's highly complementary solutions and specialized sales team. The teams have already hit the ground running with the cross-selling opportunities. And just this morning, we announced a groundbreaking partnership that will bring together HP's Chinese enterprise technology assets and China's prestigious Tsinghua University to create the leading Chinese provider of IT infrastructure. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will purchase a 51% stake in a new business called H3C, comprising our H3C Technologies business and HP's China-based server storage and technology services businesses for approximately $2.3 billion. This values the overall new H3C business at about $4.5 billion. The combined company will build on H3C's extensive and valuable patent portfolio, best-in-class products and customer focus and Tsinghua's world-class research capability. In one move, we have repositioned HP and shifted the entire technology landscape in the critical Chinese market to accelerate our overall performance and better serve our customers and partners. Turning to innovation. We continue to drive the product roadmaps for both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. We recently announced new and enhanced purpose-built compute platforms and solutions including our Apollo family of servers, which support emerging applications, including mass content storage, block and file storage, unstructured and real-time analytics, as well as simple and transactional databases. These platforms are specifically designed to help customers leverage their data to drive business outcomes like faster decision-making, improved operational efficiency and direct content monetization. Network function virtualization, or NFV, is market poised to transform the telecom industry, and we have a strong position in this emerging market. Just over a year ago, we introduced the HP OpenNFV program, providing telcos the resources to test NFV proof of concepts. Recently, TelefÃ³nica, one of the world's largest telcos, selected HP as the technology provider and systems integrator to virtualize its global infrastructure. You can expect to see more as we advance in this space. In Enterprise Services, we announced a partnership with FireEye, one of the leading security software companies. The partnership makes incidents response, compromise assessment and threat detection offerings available to HP's Enterprise Services' most strategic clients globally. This agreement helps HP protect our customers' critical information assets from advanced cyber attacks and supports our strategy to be a world-class provider of security services. And in Software, we announced several new security software offerings. We also unveiled new software releases designed to help organizations deliver mobile applications that accelerate the delivery of every phase of the mobile app life-cycle, from creation and preproduction to delivery and postproduction management. In printing, we announced a new series of LaserJet printers designed to make businesses more efficient. Built around the latest in our toner formulation, they use less energy, take up to 40% less space and wake up, print and duplex in a fraction of the time. This announcement represented HP's most significant laser printing reengineering since the introduction of the first LaserJet in 1984. Finally, in Personal Systems, HP announced a new Spectre x360 at Mobile World Congress earlier this year. This 13.3-inch convertible PC delivers a high-quality, ultra-thin design that provides the productivity of a high-end notebook, tablet mode for on the go, tent mode for play and stand mode for watching entertainment. This product earned more than 9 Best of Show awards at Mobile World Congress and continues to be recognized as one of the top products in the market. Turning to our execution. We have made significant progress across a lot of fronts over the past 6 months, and importantly, we've seen no distraction from running the business. In fact, the go-to-market approach of this company has drastically improved over the past 3 years, and I see that getting stronger going forward. Industry Standard Servers had a very strong quarter, growing 17% in constant currency, with growth across all regions, driven by strong adoption of our Gen9 portfolio and strength and density optimized in support of the explosion of Big Data in the market. In Enterprise Services, while the top line remains under pressure, the team improved profitability towards their FY '15 outlook of 4% to 6%. Signings were up year-over-year, even without the Deutsche Bank deal that we closed at the beginning of the quarter, and strategic Enterprise Services TCV was strong. Personal Systems once again outgrew the overall market and all competitors, gaining share in every region. We saw particular strength in notebooks, supported by key products, including our new EliteBook 1020 and Spectre x360 I mentioned earlier. In printing, currency is a challenge, but we gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and saw good growth in value multifunction printers and graphics. We also saw significant momentum in managed print services, with year-over-year growth in total contract value led by strong new logo signings. So overall, our performance in Q2 was in line with our expectations, but we continue to face some significant headwinds that impacted our results in the first half and may continue through the rest of the year. Unfavorable currency movements continued to be a challenge in the quarter. With over 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that in EMEA, we are disproportionately impacted by currency movements versus our competitors. And remember that currency impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. For example, our second quarter revenue declined approximately 7% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have enabled our competitors to price very aggressively. For example, aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business, given the weakness of the yen, continued to be a challenge. Finally, the currency movements and the associated repricing impacted demand. We managed to offset the currency impact to company-level operating profit in Q2 through hedges and repricing. We also saw geopolitical challenges in certain markets, including Russia and China, as well as softer public sector spending in the U.K. The PC market is also weaker than I expected at the beginning of the year, but Dion and his team are doing a great job managing through and gaining profitable share. Finally, we continue to face execution issues in pockets of the portfolio, including Software and Networking. In Software, Q2 revenue was disappointing, primarily on license weakness. But Robert and his team are making progress on realigning the portfolio and go-to-market towards SaaS, as well as partnering more closely with Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to pull through software sales in all parts of the business. In Networking, we made progress in our Americas go-to-market in the quarter and, as you can see, made some transformative moves with the Aruba acquisition and the partnership with Tsinghua in China. So to recap, while we have some challenges, I'm pleased with where we ended the quarter, the continued success of our turnaround and the progress we're making on separation. And our customers and partners continue to support our efforts, as do our employees. I couldn't be more proud of how well the entire company is working to deliver on our commitments for the year. Slowly but surely, HP is tackling its challenges and becoming stronger. It's an exhilarating time to be part of HP, and we remain on course. Before I turn it over to Cathie, I want to provide an important update on the future leadership teams of the 2 companies after separation.  As you recall, on October 6, we announced that Cathie would become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. We also said that Dion was commencing a search for the CFO for HP Inc. After looking at a number of candidates during the past few months, Dion, Cathie and I have decided that a better solution is for Cathie to take her experience over to HP Inc. So today, we've announced that Cathie will become CFO of HP Inc. after separation. This is a great outcome for Dion and his business. Cathie is a highly experienced public company CFO. She knows Dion's business cold, and she can help Dion manage the business straight out of the box. Part of the reason we can make this move is that Cathie has done a great job bringing up the next generation of leaders in HP finance. We've got a deep bench to choose from, and as a result, we've asked Tim Stonesifer to become CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Tim is currently the CFO of HP's Enterprise Group and has done a fabulous job in that role. Prior to joining HP, Tim served as CFO of international operations at General Motors Shanghai. Previously, Tim held a number of finance leadership positions during his 20-year tenure at General Electric. I've worked closely with Tim already, and I can tell you that he's a talented and experienced leader. Both Cathie and I think he's the perfect choice to be CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. But I have to say I'm going to miss working day-to-day with Cathie. Our close partnership during the past 4 years has been incredibly productive and a lot of fun. But as the future Chairman of HP Inc., it gives me great comfort to know that Dion will have Cathie by his side and I will still get to work with her. And as CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, I know I'm getting a fantastic CFO in Tim. This works out well all around. With that, I'll now turn it over to Cathie to go into a bit more business detail and to provide our Q3 financial outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a solid quarter, despite a challenging market environment. We delivered revenue of $25.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported or 2% in constant currency. Our gross margin was 24%, down 0.2 points year-over-year, driven by competitive pricing in hardware, partially offset by margin improvement in Enterprise Services and Software and favorable mix. Gross margin was up 0.6 points sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by currency, with reported declines in both SG&A and R&D. In constant currency though, R&D spend was actually up year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating profit was flat year-over-year at 8.6%. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.87 primarily excludes pretax charges of $269 million for separation, $255 million for restructuring and $221 million for amortization of intangible assets. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.55, just below our previously provided outlook range, primarily due to slightly accelerated restructuring and separation charges. We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q2, approximately 3,900 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 48,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015. Turning to the results by business. Personal Systems performed well in a softening market environment. Currency moves and the associated price adjustments had some demand impact and weighed on profitability in the quarter. Revenue declined 5% year-over-year as reported, or was flat in constant currency, with 2% unit growth. Profitability declined 0.5 points to 3%, driven primarily by unfavorable currency. Consumer revenue declined 2% year-over-year or grew 3% in constant currency, while commercial revenue declined 7% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. The commercial market continued to be soft, following momentum in 2014 from the XP refresh cycle. However, we achieved 23.1% market share, a record high. Our compelling product lineup in both consumer and commercial enabled us once again to outperform our competitors. Overall, the market slowed during the quarter, with units down 7% in calendar Q1. While we outgrew the market, we had slower sellout at the end of Q2, putting some pressure on Q3 revenue. But we do expect consumer momentum from Windows 10 in Q4. In Printing, the top line was pressured by a highly competitive market and aggressive pricing, which has an indirect impact from currency moves. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. Like last quarter, a smaller gap between as reported and constant currency relative to the other business segments due to the financial hedges in place. We continued to manage profitability well, with operating margin of 18.3%, down 1.2 points year-over-year driven by competitive pricing, partially offset by supplies mix, which was 67.6% in the quarter. We saw strength in key parts of the portfolio, including profitable growth in graphics and high-value hardware categories. We lost 1 point of share in ink, but continued our momentum in office print with unit growth of OfficeJet Pro X. We gained 1 point of share in laser year-over-year and continued to outperform the market in value multifunction printers. We exited the quarter with supplies channel inventory slightly above our desired range due to the slowdown in sales in April. We expect to reduce channel inventory levels in the second half, and we'll continue to closely monitor demand trends. Our focus remains on stabilizing supplies revenue, and the team will continue placing higher value hardware units with greater supplies attached. In Enterprise Group, revenue declined 1% year-over-year or grew 5% in constant currency, with solid operating profit of 14.5%, up 0.1 point year-over-year. Industry Standard Servers momentum continued, delivering 11% year-over-year growth as reported and 17% in constant currency. We continue to see strong option attach and higher ASPs, but strength in density-optimized servers pressured margins. We are well positioned for the second half of the year with a strong backlog, the Windows Server 2003 refresh and overall Gen9 portfolio momentum. And in Business Critical Systems, while revenue was down 15% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency, the team delivered growth in operating profit dollars driven by improved gross margin and OpEx management. Superdome X and Nonstop X pipelines are growing and driving momentum across the mission-critical x86 portfolio, including Big Data converged solutions. Storage declined 8% year-over-year or 2% in constant currency. While we had solid growth in 3PAR and overall Converged Storage and expect to gain about 0.3 points of share overall in calendar Q1, a decline in traditional storage products and weaker-than-expected performance in EMEA drove revenue lower. All-flash 3PAR revenue grew again, and Gartner reported HP was the fastest growing flash vendor in 2014. In the second half, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage to drive a return to growth overall in constant currency. Networking had another difficult quarter with revenues declining 16% year-over-year as reported or 11% in constant currency. We made progress on driving stronger sales execution in the U.S. and grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency in EMEA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. China results were disappointing, but overall, we expect Networking performance will improve organically in the second half of the year. And we're optimistic about the future of this business as we onboard the Aruba team and integrate the competitive portfolio of products and solutions. We're excited to have Dom Orr as the head of the new Networking business, and you will begin to see combined financials in the third quarter results. As Meg discussed, we're also excited about our new partnership with Tsinghua in China. We believe this new structure will turn around and accelerate performance for H3C, our networking business in China. We expect the deal to close after the separation near the end of 2015, so we won't see an impact to our financials until fiscal 2016. Once it closes, we will account for our ownership using the equity method, with our 49% share of earnings flowing through the other interest and expense line. Technology Services revenue declined 8% year-over-year as reported or just 2% in constant currency. Orders were down 9% year-over-year as reported, but were up 2% in constant currency, driven by higher hardware volume from Industry Standard Servers and new solutions including Datacenter and Proactive Care. Penetration rates were up year-over-year for Business Critical Systems, Networking and traditional Industry Standard Servers, but the total penetration rate was down on mix. Going forward, we expect TS to stabilize with improving hardware sales. In Enterprise Services, we continue to be pressured by key account runoffs as well as weakness in EMEA and ITO overall, although the team continues to execute against its profitability outlook this year. Revenue declined 16% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency, while delivering 4% operating profit, up 1.4 points year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services signings continued to grow, and Application and Business Services revenue showed marked improvement. Although Q2 revenue was weak, we do expect improvement in the second half and maintain our full year revenue outlook of 4% to 6% year-over-year decline in constant currency. And given the progress on efficiencies and expected quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full year operating profit outlook of 4% to 6%. As we look beyond this fiscal year, we have a path to operating profit of 7% to 9%, but ITO industry challenges have been accelerating, driving risks to the longer-term sustainability of this profit level without further actions. Our current view is that we need to take up to $2 billion of gross annualized costs out of this business over the next 3 years. To effect any level of savings, we would expect to incur GAAP-only charges of up to a similar amount. We'll provide more information as we finalize our plans. Software had a challenging quarter with weakness across the portfolio. Revenue was down 8% year-over-year as reported or 5% in constant currency. We did deliver double-digit year-over-year growth in SaaS bookings, driven by strong performance in IT management and enterprise security. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost control, reducing operating expenses year-over-year. However, the accelerated revenue decline pressured profitability. Operating profit was 17.9%, down 1.3 points year-over-year. In the second half, we expect continued pressure on the top line as we evolve our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. HP Financial Services revenue declined 7% year-over-year as reported or was flat in constant currency. Financing volume was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but was up 7% in constant currency with strength in the direct business. Return on equity was 15.1%. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated cash flow from operations of $1.5 billion and free cash flow of $766 million. The cash conversion cycle improved to 4 days, down 9 days year-over-year and down 1 day sequentially. We now expect the cash conversion cycle to be better than the 10 to 12 days forecast previously provided. However, there are a few items creating a cash flow headwind in fiscal 2015. One of the main items is related to how we hedge net monetary assets and liabilities, where our hedges and underlying currency gains and losses offset one another in the P&L but the cash flows may not. Our hedges are 30-day hedges, while our underlying exposures range from 14 days to multiple years. With large moves in currencies, this creates a timing difference between when we realize the cash flow from hedges versus the underlying exposures. Some of these timing differences reverse quickly within a quarter or 2, while others are longer term. So while there is an overall headwind in this year's cash flow given the current currency rates, these timing differences will net out over time. In addition to the hedge cash flow timing differences, we are also seeing cash flow impact for the year from pulling forward some of the restructuring and separation cash payments from 2016, a reduction in warranty given lower PC shipments, and lower deferred revenue in TS due to currency and lower-than-expected orders. Given these headwinds and tailwinds, we are holding our full year free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We repurchased 19 million shares in the quarter and paid $291 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $950 million. Moving to the separation. We continue to make excellent progress and remain on track to meet the time line for separation by the end of the fiscal year. I want to take some time to provide an update on onetime charges, dis-synergies, cost savings and the Form 10 filing. First, Q2 separation charges were $269 million and we expect Q3 charges to be $464 million. The multiyear estimate of total separation charges, including taxes and the associated credits that we announced on the Q1 earnings call, remains unchanged. And as Meg shared, we estimate the ongoing dis-synergies associated with operating 2 separate companies to be $400 million to $450 million, which are split between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. These costs are primarily associated with corporate functions, including finance, legal, IT, real estate and HR. As expected, working through the creation of 2 new more efficient and accountable organizations has uncovered opportunities for significant cost reductions. Our assessment is that we could take up to $1 billion of gross annualized costs out of the organizations in total and would incur a GAAP-only charge of a similar amount. Although we don't yet have specific details to share, we expect to implement enough cost savings in the near term to offset more than half of the separation dis-synergies in fiscal 2016, and starting in fiscal 2017, would more than offset all dis-synergies. We have also concluded on the legal form of our separation. Based primarily on tax considerations, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be the spin company in the U.S. The legal form may be different across all of the countries in which we do business. Finally, we still expect to file our Form 10 later this summer, and we'll continue to provide updates as we approach November 1. Looking forward, currency may continue to be volatile. And if it is, each of our businesses will be impacted differently based on natural hedges, existing financial hedges, repricing capabilities and the overall market environment. Based on the current rates, we expect full year revenue to be flat to slightly down in constant currency. With all of that in mind, our guidance for fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $3.53 to $3.73. Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook remains in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q3 '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.83 to $0.87. And Q3 '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: It sounds like there are incremental pressures on cash flow this year, including the weakness in the PC market. So Cathie, can you just clarify what's allowing you to hold the guidance for $3.5 billion to $4 billion free cash flow this year? And then just as a clarification, is the $400 million to $450 million of dis-synergies next year all cash costs, such that it's unlikely you can get back to the $6.5 billion to $7 billion free cash flow target that you had started this year with?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Katy. So when we look at the free cash flow for fiscal '15, we have headwinds and we have tailwinds that are really impacting FY '15. And when you kind of net them both together, you get into the range of the $3.5 billion to $4 billion, so we're able to hold. The tailwind that we see is that the cash conversion cycle, given the performance that we've had in the first half of the year, is now expected to be better than the 10 to 12 days that we had previously provided as an outlook. And so that offsets the headwinds around the balance sheet hedging that I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well as some of the pull-in that we've got around -- from 2016 for restructuring and separation costs and then a little bit on the deferred revenue and warranty reserve. And then in terms of the $400 million to $450 million of dis-synergies in '16 and beyond, yes, those are all cash costs. But as I mentioned, we will take approximately $1 billion of gross run rate savings out of the company across HPE and HPI. And so we will offset more than half of those with those cost savings in fiscal 2016, but of course, we will take a GAAP-only charge of about $1 billion.
Margaret Whitman: And let me add one thing, Katy. It's Meg. While the PC market is weaker than we anticipated, we're actually doing better in some of the businesses, like Industry Standard Servers. So while the cash flow might be slightly lower in PCs, depending on how the market evolves, we're actually going to more than make that up. And you can see that in our earnings per share, which is obviously -- we're holding our earnings per share guidance.
Catherine Lesjak: And I think it's also important to think about the PC business as yes, there's been incremental pressure on profits. But we have done a great job of executing in the PC market and in fact, have continued to gain really strong share across all of the regions in the world, including China on a year-over-year basis and have outgrown many of our competitors.
Operator: The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi at Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I just wanted to clarify. You talked about a $1 billion GAAP charge associated with restructuring opportunities from the separation and potentially $2 billion in GAAP charges associated with streamlining the Services business. So is GAAP a code word for cash charges, because not all GAAP charges are cash charges? So should we be thinking about $3 billion in cash charges? And from a timing perspective, I would imagine that most of the $1 billion in cash charges associated with the restructuring is in fiscal '16, with some in fiscal '17. Can you help us on that, please?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So Toni, we're not intending that GAAP is code word for cash but -- because there can be GAAP-only charges that are not cash. But these ones are expected to be all cash charges, and so you've got that right. And then in terms of the timing, we really see these cash outflows related to these charges to be taking place over 3 years. So it will be a little bit more front-end loaded to offset the dis-synergies. But we would expect them to be -- both the $1 billion related to separation as well as the up to $2 billion for the Enterprise Services business streamlining to be over 3 years.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then sorry, could you just clarify currency? I mean, you brought down guidance for the year last quarter and said that currency would impact you $0.60 and $0.30 on a net basis. Currency is a lot more benign based on current spot rates than what you've reported in the first 2 quarters. Is there an update on what the gross and net impact on EPS is for currency? And I guess the question is why wouldn't your guidance be adjusted upward for that reason?
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, what we do is at the point in time we provided outlook, we take kind of that beginning of that month set of rates and we forecast the rest of the year. And if you actually compare the currency rates at the beginning of May to those at the beginning of February, when we provided the outlook for the year of $3.53 to $3.73, they are roughly the same. They are not materially changed.
Operator: Next question is from Maynard Um at Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: Can I just also clarify that Aruba is included in the guide? And I'm curious because I get some accretion for the back half but guidance is unchanged, so I'm just wondering if that implies there's some incremental pressure somewhere offsetting? And then just on the question, I get a lot of questions, as do you, I'm sure, around free cash flow returning to that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. With the sale of H3C, I estimate you'll lose around $400 million to $500 million in operating cash. Half goes away, and then the other half drops to the investing line on the cash flow statement. You'll have some net dis-synergies of about $200 million to $225 million in fiscal '16 and then any incremental restructuring charges if you do find these cost savings post-split. And then presumably, that's offset by the foreign tax credits that come back. No big separation related costs versus this year and then cash flow from Aruba, but it still seems you'd be short of that $6.5 billion to $7 billion. So can you just maybe help bridge that difference? Or how we should think about that? Is it M&A that's making it up from the cash proceeds from H3C and Snapfish? Or is there something else to think about there?
Catherine Lesjak: Boy, Maynard, I'm trying to follow all those numbers for you. But let me first clarify that Aruba is not in our guide. It just closed the other day, and it is not in our guide for the year. Secondly, in terms of how to think about the cash flow model for fiscal '16, I can't validate all those puts and takes that you've given, but I do -- I will throw out the following for you to think through. First, we think that the cash conversion cycle will be less of a headwind going into '16 than it was going into '15. You do want to take into consideration the fact that the 2012 program restructuring charges will be coming down pretty materially. But of course, we will have the offset to the incremental GAAP-only charges that we've talked about today. We will have significantly lower separation kind of impact to cash flow from separation across basically taxes that we need to pay, the incremental costs associated with that and the CapEx. And then I think currency is a little bit of a complicated topic, for sure. But you need to obviously think about what you think the currency is going to do, but also take into consideration the implications to cash of our broad hedging programs, our balance sheet hedging programs, which I talked a little bit about, but also some of the benefits that we're getting from our revenue hedging program. And then, of course, that's all on top of kind of what you think the outlook is for earnings.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: I think you're holding an Analyst Day later this year to go into details about each business post the separation. But as you think qualitatively about the operating profiles of each business beyond the split, Meg, should we anticipate that there might be any meaningful changes in organic growth strategies, investment intensity or the like that could result in a different operating profile than what we're seeing today? Or should it be closer to business as usual and more refinement of existing strategies?
Margaret Whitman: So we will have an Analyst Day as we approach the separation. We haven't exactly set a date yet, but it will be early to late fall, and we will lay out the operating profit -- the operating profile of both companies, both not only from an operating profit, but also a capital structure. Because you'll recall around October 6 when we announced, we thought that HP Inc. would be more YieldCo because of the strong cash flow from Printing business, and Hewlett Packard Enterprise would be more targeted to growth at a reasonable price, or GARP investors, and the capital structure will reflect that. Also, I anticipate both companies will actually be doing acquisitions, but probably more so on the Hewlett Packard Enterprise as that market's growing a bit faster. So we'll lay all of that out for you at the security analysts meeting. And then actually, we will probably be on a roadshow to investors to make sure that everyone has a chance to understand in as much detail as we can provide what the outlook looks like for each company. I don't know, Cathie, if you want to add anything to that
Catherine Lesjak: So I wouldn't add anything more other than to say that we will be filing our Form 10 in the July time frame. And in that, while it will not have all of the information that I'm sure you will want in terms of kind of FY '16 forward-looking, it will have a preliminary cost structure review -- or sorry, capital structure -- sorry, capital structure review. So you'll get a first glimpse of that in the early July time frame.
Operator: The next question is from Sherri Scribner at Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I just wanted to get a clarification on the additional restructuring charges that you talked about this quarter. The $1 billion and the $2 billion, in terms of the impact to the cash in fiscal '16, how should we think about that? Should we think of those cost savings as mostly offsetting those restructuring charges, but because the restructuring charges are a bit front-end loaded, that cash benefit won't come until later in the 3-year period? And then I just wanted to get a little bit of detail on the strength that you're seeing in the Industry Standard Server business, and why you think you're seeing strength there.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So in terms of the potential GAAP-only charges that we've been talking about, they will be a bit front-end loaded. But you should think about them as being over 3 years. And that, from a cash flow perspective, from the savings, the savings will lag that just a little bit. I think the insight into fiscal '16 that we provided is that the dis-synergies of $400 million to $450 million will be more than half offset in fiscal '16. And so we will obviously get some cash flow benefit from the actions that we will take with these GAAP-only charges in '16.
Margaret Whitman: And then entirely, the $400 million to $450 million, we believe will be entirely offset in '17.
Catherine Lesjak: And a bit more than that.
Margaret Whitman: Yes.
Catherine Lesjak: So -- but we likely won't get to a full run rate savings from the -- gross savings from these actions until probably the run rate exit of fiscal '18.
Margaret Whitman: In terms of Industry Standard Servers, we are seeing very strong momentum, I think, driven by a couple of things. First is I think it's our best-ever product line and very, very solid sales execution that is actually playing into a pretty healthy market as well. I mean, as I said, ISS revenue grew 11% year-over-year as reported and 17% in local currency. And we expect to gain share when the Q1 results are out. And I think it's our products like Gen9, which is off to a very fast start, Cloudline and Apollo are resonating well with customers that are purpose-built for specific workloads to deliver business outcomes. So we've got the workload and the business outcome lined with the right infrastructure. And then there's another little tailwind, which is the Windows Server 2000 and refresh -- our 2003 refresh, the ramp of our Foxconn partnership and improved win rates, frankly, against Lenovo as they take over the IBM server business. And I'll say one thing, we haven't talked much about cloud on this call because there was so much to cover here. But we're pretty pleased with the results of our Cloud business. And what you have to remember, it shows up. The success of Cloud shows up in 4 places in the -- 3 places in the HP P&L. One is Industry Standard Servers because we are, by far and away, the leader in private cloud, whether it's Gartner or IDC or whoever, so that shows up in ISS. Our virtual private cloud or managed cloud services shows up in Enterprise Services. And then CSA, the Cloud Service Automation and orchestration software that knits it all together, shows up in Software. So we may, over time, break out or run alongside sort of overall cloud revenues as opposed to just having it show up in the individual businesses. But for the moment, probably through the end of this year, we'll report it in the different businesses. So I just thought I'd say a word about that's another reason that ISS is strong as private cloud.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me add just a couple more things. On the quarter, the win rate that Meg talked about is up relative to the previous quarter low-double digits, so really strong improvement there. We are bringing on hundreds of new customers that haven't bought from HP in the last 12 months. So we're making really good progress against kind of the Lenovo lineup. And then in terms of the rest of the year for ISS, we've got a really nice wind at our back. We've got -- we're going into the second half with a strong backlog, so a better backlog, frankly, than we normally see going into Q3. As Meg said, we do have the Windows Server 2003 also coming up and, as you may recall, that is expiring in I think it's July of this year. And then Meg mentioned the Gen9 momentum.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: I was hoping if you could just talk a bit about the $2 billion of potential restructuring you have to do for the Services business. It seems like it's 10% of your revenue stream over there. So what are the challenges you're seeing there that you need to take that big of a new restructuring charge to get the 7% to 9% margins? And do you think potentially the piece of this portfolio that's just unprofitable and you may be better walking away from it? So maybe if you can just talk about what's leading the charges in the revenue stream, that'd be helpful.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. I think there's a couple of things going on in our Enterprise Services business. First is we are making progress towards the long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating margin. But the ITO industry challenges have accelerated and are driving risk in the sustainability of this profit level if we don't do further cost reductions. And I'd say there's a couple of sort of large-scale secular trends that are impacting that ITO business. First is the government austerity programs have forced a business model transformation both here as well as in Europe. And basically, the public sector business has gone from buying in a fixed fee model to a cost-plus model, so that put some pressure on. And then secondly, there are -- is a definitely accelerated move to a consumption model, which is going to require us to make a faster labor mix shift to low-cost resources and, frankly, the transformation of the physical data center footprint to much more streamlined footprint that are far more automated. So there's real market shifts going on here. And basically, the additional savings plan that we mentioned today would derisk our plan for ES to reach that 7% to 9% operating margins but, more importantly, would enable us to sustain that level of profitability over time. So we've got more aggressive labor pyramid shifts that has to take place onshore, offshore locations to make sure that we stay competitive in that market. And the market's changing dramatically. That said, our apps business and our business process outsourcing business and our strategic Enterprise Services businesses are looking healthier. But remember, ITO is a big chunk of our Enterprise Services business.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me just give some -- I guess, some data that supports that. If you look at our ITO business in this quarter, it was down 20% year-over-year, and it had about 6 points of currency, so it was still down 14% on a constant-currency basis. Now there is an impact from the top 3 runoff, but it is still a lot softer than what we had been seeing. And so we're definitely starting to see the pressures in the ITO space. On the app side, we really -- we saw declines of 8% as reported in revenue, but only 2% in constant currency. And if you adjust for currency, we had a couple of our regions that actually were flat to slightly up, and we see that progressing as we go into the second half. So it really is much more of an ITO challenge and the change in the market dynamics.
Margaret Whitman: And then let me -- you've kind of asked a strategic question, I'm going to interpret it as sort of how does services fit? And if you pull the lens back, let me give you my perspective on this business. As our customers are requiring business outcome solutions as opposed to a migration, which used to be they used to buy on a point product solution basis, we are going to have to lead with Services because our customers are asking for transformation services, for business outcomes, for cost, efficiency, better return on invested capital of their assets, and both our Services business in ES as well as our TS consulting businesses are becoming more strategic to the future of Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And my view is that if we don't have a healthy Services business, that will actually compromise our overall business as we go forward because increasingly, Services is becoming the tip of the spear in how we go to market, not only to direct customers but, frankly, our partners and VARs are seeing the exact same thing. So the combination of ES plus TS consulting is going to be a really important strategic weapon, I think, for HP going forward.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross at Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Meg, can you talk a bit about the China JV, why you included both the servers as well as storage and networking with the JV, how you see it sort of running in conjunction with HP Enterprise? And just -- we kind of understand what was behind the sale of the Networking business, but how you think you're going to be working together with them?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So first of all, I think we have a terrific partner in Tsinghua. As many of you know, Tsinghua is sort of the Harvard and the MIT of China rolled into one, with incredible R&D capability and very much a part of sort of the Chinese community, if you will. And so obviously, H3C was going to be rolled into this joint venture, but frankly, increasingly, servers, storage, technology services and networking, they are converging in China, just like they are here. And we thought it made sense to take all our Chinese enterprise assets and put them into this joint venture. As I said, it will be owned 51% by Tsinghua, 49% by us, and we're excited about the future possibilities. I will tell you already, the H3C and the China HP employees are pretty psyched up about this. They woke up to this news this morning. They're pumped up. And I think this is going to unleash a whole host of business in the Chinese market. So the things that will remain outside of the Tsinghua JV is our Enterprise Services business, which is primarily a business that serves multinational customers. So for example, if we're serving P&G in China, that would be Enterprise Services. The other is our cloud business, HP Helion cloud business, as well as our Printing and PC business. And then, of course, Software, which is a very, very small business in China. So the bulk of our Chinese business goes into this JV with the exception obviously -- we have a very big Printing and PC business but that's a completely different business. So that was the thinking behind it.
Shannon Cross: Will the JV sell to any other countries besides China? Or are they just limited to China?
Catherine Lesjak: So Shannon, we're going to be their distributor for all of the networking products in the rest of the world. So they will not be selling any of the products that are developed in China to the rest of the world except through us as distributor.
Margaret Whitman: Exactly. So the real point of this JV is in China for China for the Chinese market, and obviously, the Networking products, we'll distribute globally, as Cathie said.
Operator: Our last question is from Keith Bachman at Bank of MontrÃ©al.
Keith Bachman: Meg, I was hoping you could review your perspective on what Win 10 may do for the market, the timing. And if you could include any comments, your profitability was down a little bit in PCs today. And I know Cathie mentioned FX was a part of it. But how would that impact profitability, if at all, and also the revenue side? And I wanted to sneak one in to Shannon's question on the Chinese JV. How do you protect your IP in that JV?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, okay. Well, I actually happen to have Dion Weisler here. So Dion, why don't you talk a little bit about Win 10 and what you expect on profitability? And then, I'll come back on the China JV and the IP.
Dion Weisler: Sure. Look, I think in the consumer segment, we obviously are expecting and are hopeful that Windows 10 will provide some stimulus for the marketplace. I think that will be ahead of some tapering off of demand, just ahead of the Windows 10 launch. In the commercial segment, we see slower acceptance always in new operating systems, as evidenced, I guess, by the XP migration, which was largely completed towards the end of FY '14. And therefore, we don't really anticipate a significant impact on the commercial business, either positive or negative. Yet on the consumer side, we expect that towards the back end of this year, it will provide some stimulus.
Margaret Whitman: Yes.
Keith Bachman: And does that impact your profitability, Dion? Or is 3% the right run rate?
Dion Weisler: Look, we obviously don't guide by segment. But I think it's fair to say that this is a transition, just like similar transitions that we've seen in the marketplace. There's a consolidating market going on at the moment. We believe that it will remain a competitive marketplace. We think we're outperforming our competitors, and that profitability will run according to that.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, yes.
Catherine Lesjak: And the profitability in Q2 was heavily impacted by currency. But offsetting some of the currency benefits were really strong operating efficiencies because Dion's businesses are also very much focused on streamlining and staying maniacally focused on costs, as well as a favorable commodity environment. And we do expect that, that commodity view will persist into Q3. And then the other thing I just -- I think I should have pointed out before is that the XP refresh kind of peak quarter was Q3 of last year. And so the entire market is going to come up against very tough compares when you look at our numbers in Q3.
Margaret Whitman: Especially markets -- like markets like Japan.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes.
Margaret Whitman: Let me answer the IP question. So we develop IP in China and have for some time in the context of H3C. And then, as we move our server and our storage business, obviously, into this new JV, we'll have an OEM agreement from HP to H3C Tsinghua JV. And obviously, we've been very focused on protecting the IP. I think we've got an excellent framework agreement. We're not naÃ¯ve, but we've got an excellent framework agreement. And I think -- I will say I think Tsinghua in this regard is a very, very good partner. So we're optimistic about it, and I think it is going to accelerate the business in China.
Jim Bergkamp: Thanks, Keith, and thanks, everybody, for your questions. I think we're done with the call. Thank you.
Operator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that, overall, we're on track with our turnaround and executing well on our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance in our business operations. We achieved non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range. We continue to improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased investment in innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and we executed well across key areas of our portfolio, including Industry Standard Servers, Converged Storage, private and managed Cloud, Personal Systems and Graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business, we're about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey. Now there a couple of factors that had an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with a particular focus on unfavorable currency movements, and I also want to address cash flow. We're all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for U.S.-based companies. For HP, the challenge is particularly acute, with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways. The strength of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements have disrupted the competitive pricing landscape and impacted customer demand. Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the Printing business, given the weakness of the yen, was a continued challenge. We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected, but given the specific hedges we had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the remainder of FY '15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1. We're working hard to offset these impacts through repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear. Fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units. That simply would not be the right thing to do. When we discussed the impact of currency on revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be approximately 2 points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately 6 points assuming today's rates. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60 in earnings per share. We believe will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions, but estimate a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we have taken down our full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will share more details on how we manage currency movements across the portfolio. Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations, impacted primarily by an increase in our cash conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher days sales outstanding. Also, we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected and outperformed on HP Financial Services volume, which negatively impact cash year-on-year. However, except for the currency impact and separation payments, we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment. Now let's talk about business performance and innovation. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to make progress in our operating performance. In Personal Systems, the team is executing well. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks, where we regained our #1 share position worldwide. Commercial remains a key focus for us. And at Discover in December, we announced the industry's thinnest and lightest business-class notebook, enabling our customers to be more productive in more places. In Printing, profitability remained strong, but we continue to face top line challenges. Hardware and supplies revenue declined. And going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term supplies growth. I'm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming months. The Enterprise Group performed well with 9% growth in constant currency in Industry Standard Servers, led by strong Gen9 adoption and improved sales execution. HP's end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio has redefined the broader server industry, and improvements in sales execution are paying off. We also saw improved performance in Business Critical Systems, and our new products are gaining traction with customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity NonStop X. These platforms run our customers' most demanding, mission-critical workloads on x86 architectures with higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency. In Storage, we returned to growth in constant currency, and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disk market share expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the midrange, which is our sweet spot. And at Discover, we announced a refreshed portfolio of midrange and flash-optimized HP 3PAR StoreServ systems. And it's becoming clear around the industry that our HP Converged Storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this month, HP 3PAR won the 2014 Search Storage Product of the Year gold award. However, in Networking, results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the U.S. and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter, which we believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the U.S., we are realigning sales incentives to increase focus. We continue to bring new Networking solutions to market. Just last week, we announced a new line of open network switches, providing web-scale customers choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. We are focused on winning in this business, and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters. Technology Services was consistent with recent quarters with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued to execute well, improving efficiency across the organization while driving order growth in constant currency. We were pleased with the continued momentum in newer portfolio offerings like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care. In Cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud. During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel-Lucent, Halfords, Telecom Italia and Symantec, and we've seen strong pull-through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion. Last month, HP Helion was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research in their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China, earning the highest ranking for strategy. And early in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in U.S. government private cloud. In Enterprise Services, revenue continued to be impacted by key account runoff, softness in EMEA and currency headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year, in line with our expectations. And sales metrics are reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business. Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise Services was selected by TNT, one of the world's largest express delivery companies, to help future-proof the business by consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion-managed virtual private cloud environment. And just today, we announced a major multibillion-dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With this partnership, HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT infrastructure, including a customized HP Helion solution that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering new services for their clients. This was a hard-fought win for HP, and I'm very pleased with the outcome. In Software, we continue to shift our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. Customer consumption behavior and the need to adjust sales motions accordingly created a near-term revenue headwind. Total revenue was down. However, we saw growth in security, and our recent acquisition of Voltage Security strengthens our portfolio in data encryption. During the quarter, we also unveiled HP HAVEn OnDemand, an important milestone in our Big Data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based access to key components of our HAVEn analytics platform. Overall, we continue to see strength across many of our businesses while other areas still need more work. Operationally, we get stronger with each passing month. And just as important, our innovation engine continues to hum, and I expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate through the rest of the year. With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to provide a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook.
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion, down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continued to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year. Gross margin was 23.4%, up 0.6 points year-over-year. And quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down 1.2 points, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8%, up 0.3 points year-over-year. We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1, about 2,800 people exited the company, making the total reduction to date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal '15. However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for operational improvements identified through the separation process. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pretax charges of $222 million for amortization of intangible assets, $146 million for restructuring and $80 million associated with the separation. Including these charges, GAAP diluted net earnings per share for Q1 was $0.73, in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share. Turning to the business performance. In Personal Systems, revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported. We outgrew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We saw particular strength in notebooks and continued to rollout exciting products. While commercial revenue was up only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration, we saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4% revenue growth in constant currency. In Printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or 5% as reported, with some challenges in both hardware and supplies and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remains strong at 19.2%. Declines in low-end home and single-function mono laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year. While it will take some time to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high-usage products like Officejet Pro X and value multifunction printers. Graphics performance remains strong with our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increase in scale has contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit. Also, in Managed Print Services, we saw double-digit total contract value growth year-over-year. Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continue to improve the revenue trajectory in ink while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges. Overall, supplies revenue mix was 65% of total print revenue. The Enterprise Group performed well with revenue up 3% in constant currency or flat as reported, with strong profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency or 7% as reported, with growth across all regions and strength in core rack and blades categories. We also saw some recovery in Business Critical Systems with revenue down only 7% in constant currency or 9% as reported. In Storage, performance improved in Q1, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency or flat as reported. Converged Storage was up 21%, now making up 50% of total Storage revenue. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 12% year-over-year. All-flash 3PAR revenue accelerated, now making up 20% of total 3PAR midrange portfolio. Also, we expect to be the only scaled vendor to gain external disk share year-over-year for the last 4 quarters. In Networking, revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. However, we continue to see positive momentum in our data center switching business, which grew for the fifth consecutive quarter. And while we had execution issues in the U.S. and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world. Technology Services revenue was down 2% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported. Orders grew in constant currency, driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals. Enterprise Services revenue was down 8% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. Application and business services and IT outsourcing were each down 11%, as key account runoff and weaknesses in EMEA offset the momentum we're seeing in strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT. Profitability improved year-over-year to 3%, up 1.9 points, driven primarily by productivity actions and improved margins in underperforming accounts. Also, the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced field selling costs. Total contract value was up with double-digit growth in renewals, in new logos and in SCS signings, with particular strength in key areas including Cloud and Big Data. Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year in constant currency or down 5% as reported as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS. Profitability was 18%, up 2.2 points year-over-year, as we effectively managed costs while increasing R&D investment in strategic areas such as Big Data and security. Finally, in HP Financial Services, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or down 8% as reported due to an early contract termination in the prior year period, making for a tough compare for revenue and operating profit. However, we experienced double-digit new volume growth and record-high attach rate to HP's products and services. ROE was just over 17%, and HP Financial Services continues to be a key differentiator for HP. Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our business. With 2/3 of our revenue coming from outside of the U.S., the impact from currency movements is significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook and this is entirely due to the currency challenges she described. We continue to offset currency movements as much as possible through hedging strategies. We have rolling hedging programs, which is designed to minimize the volatility of results by dampening large fluctuations. However, significant and sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also use repricing as a lever when possible, considering competitive market dynamics. The hedging programs vary by business depending upon these factors. As an example, Personal Systems and our EG hardware businesses have very little in natural hedges as our component contracts are typically in U.S. dollars. As a result, these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency movements. However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements while being mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand. In Printing, we have a lot of moving parts, with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly. Like the other segments, the Printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom line. The weaker yen helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more aggressively. In addition, Printing, specifically the laser business, is overweight in Russia, which adds yet another dimension to currency impact. Services have more natural hedges since revenue and expenses are more closely matched in the same currency, but due to the nature of the contracts, repricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge while also making the right trade-offs to support our strategy for long-term success. We discussed the currency impacts to the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monetary assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses are reported within the other assets and liabilities section and not the specific cash flow line item. Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest a working capital headwind year-over-year of approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly, the cash headwind from reported financing receivables appears in the statement of cash flows to be approximately $100 million but is actually closer to $250 million when including this adjustment. The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important so we can focus on the true drivers of cash flow. Next, I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $744 million and free cash flow was negative $73 million. We had several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1. Remember, Q1 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP, and we did expect this to be true again in fiscal '15. Having said that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations, and I want to take a minute to explain. First, we had a working capital impact. The cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 '15 but declined sequentially in Q1 '14, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging. While we anticipated a lot of this, days sales outstanding was higher than expected, largely due to nonrecurring operational issues in the quarter, intra-month linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured in our outlook. We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year-end as we continue to make the right trade-offs between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by boat versus by plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales. Similarly, taking advantage of early pay discounts from suppliers reduces cost but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost-benefit analysis to make sure these decisions drive economic value. Next, we had a tough compare. Q1 '14 included proceeds from a large real estate sale, which drove an increase in net CapEx year-over-year in Q1 '15. Finally, there were several other unfavorable movements in Q1 '15. We had double-digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business, but this was a greater use of cash of this year than last. We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers as well as lower litigation reserves. And we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected. I want to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate cash as we've demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an updated outlook today to our free cash flow, but the reduction from our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts we've announced today. Turning to capital allocation. In Q1, we repurchased 41.1 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for a total capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014 commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. Turning to the separation. As we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation costs and foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016 associated with separating into 2 companies. The scale of this separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity. Over the past few months, we defined and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and onetime in nature and not reflective of our operational performance. In addition, we've estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with this separation are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings. The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million, and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be approximately $250 million. Full year fiscal '15 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FY '16 estimate is $500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating costs and are necessary to realize the potential of the separation into 2 world-class companies. Separation-related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental gross foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax expenses to be offset by foreign tax credits. In fiscal '15, we anticipate a credit of about $200 million and the rest over the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly calls. Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015. From a macro perspective, we've already talked about the impact associated with currency shifts. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies, including China, where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors; and Russia, where political and economic concerns are ongoing. These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the U.S. economy. By business. In Personal Systems, while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we plan to leverage our brand, channel, scale and strong product lineup to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial, including commercial mobility. In Printing, we're planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high-value units. We will manage supplies channel inventory closely while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal '15. In Enterprise Group, we expect server momentum to continue with the Gen9 lineup and server refresh cycle. We expect Storage, particularly 3PAR, to outperform key competitors, especially in the midrange. In Networking, we expect continued challenges in the near term but are making adjustments to improve execution. In Enterprise Services, we expect continued improvement in profitability, making progress towards our long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating profit, and remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%. Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing a new Enterprise Services full year revenue outlook. Because of the currency volatility, going forward, we will provide this on a constant currency basis. We now expect full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%. We expect year-over-year revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal '15. In Software, we plan to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture the growing SaaS opportunity. We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the organization. Overall for fiscal '15, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However, the currency headwind at current rates cannot be fully absorbed. We've done detailed modeling using current exchange rates and assumptions for repricing and productivity. With all that in mind, we're updating fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73, which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds. Fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal '15 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88, which includes $0.09 of currency pressure. Q2 fiscal '15 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61. Given the updated earnings outlook for currency and the introduction of cash-related separation activities, we are updating our fiscal '15 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: Meg, you're now a couple of months into the separation, and I assume that you've gotten more detail on where you can find some additional savings. I was hoping you could talk through some of the additional savings you expect and also how you feel about the separation at this point, 3 months in.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, great, Sherri. So we are making real progress on the separation. Recall that we are separating into 2 Fortune 50 companies. I mean, it's sort of hard to imagine that there are 2 Fortune 50 companies embedded in HP. And that has included an entire organizational design and selection process, the IT strategy, carve-out financials and many other activities. And I think actually that we are executing on all cylinders. There has not been distraction to the core business. We've got a dedicated team focusing on the separation, and the rest of the company is focused on delivering for customers. And I feel very good about that. And also, the feedback from partners and customers has been terrific. So lots and lots of work ahead, but I feel good about where we are. It has surfaced lots of opportunities for continued cost savings and the ability to operate more efficiently. And when you tear apart a company that's been built up over many years through acquisition, through different systems being merged together, it's remarkable what you find. And whether it is single owners for end-to-end cost structure, the ability to benchmark versus our competitors on how many spans and layers we have, the ability to make small changes in the portfolio that we want to go forward with, lots and lots of opportunities that's going to make us much stronger as we go forward as 2 independent companies. So we're pretty excited about it. It is a huge amount of work, but I have to say it's exhilarating because we see the future, where these 2 companies will be far more cost competitive than even we are today as HPQ.
Operator: The next question will come from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: Can you just talk a little bit about the Deutsche Bank deal? My impression of the scope of the deal was much deeper than maybe some would think you have the capability to provide. Maybe if you can just give us more specifics around that and detail around the deal. What was the primary driver to the win? Were there particular products or solutions that were central to it? And then maybe just related to that, more generally, talk about where you are in Services bookings and where you expect that to be.
Margaret Whitman: So we're very proud of the Deutsche Bank win. And it was a full-on one HP effort, including our Enterprise Group, our Software business, our Cloud business as well as our Services business. And it was a Services-led win. And I believe the reason that we won is we have the best technical solution for what Deutsche Bank needed, which was to reduce cost, increase -- reduce cost significantly by the way, increase agility and migrate to a new world order of CICD, DevOps and a cloud-based environment. So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know, this is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago, maybe even closer to 2 years. So these are long-standing deals. But we're very excited because everyone in the industry wanted this business. It was a hallmark or a lighthouse account, and we did it on our terms. So we feel pretty good about it. I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support on an unprecedented scale was an important part of the win, and our ability to advise and transform. The key risk in these deals is how do you get from where you are to where you need to be, and I think we were judged to be the safest pair of hands.
Operator: The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue expectation for this year. You were down about 2.5% at constant currency this quarter. I think the goal was to be about flat at constant currency for this year. Do you still believe you can achieve that? And I guess given some of the commentary around geographies, et cetera, it would seem not. And so perhaps I go back to you, Meg, and say you're on track but it actually feels like you're a little bit behind track in terms of where you thought revenues may have been for this year.
Margaret Whitman: So we still believe we can be flat in constant currency in FY '15. And as you can imagine, we've put a lot of thought into this because the macroeconomic environment, particularly in places like Russia, where we are overexposed, in China, is pretty challenging. But listen, we did well in PSG, very well in Industry Standard Servers, and this is perhaps the big turnaround over the last couple of years. This was a very troubled business 2 years ago and the team has done a remarkable job. Graphics and print is doing extremely well. And ES, and this will be the key to a flat constant currency, is we expect better revenue performance in the second half from ES. Profitability was good in Q1, but we expect to have a much slower rate of decline by the end of the year. And Deutsche, TNT, other wins are important to that. So I'm optimistic that we will be flat in constant currency. Listen, if there's another major geopolitical disruption, that could be off the table. But as we sit here today, we think flat in constant currency. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
Catherine Lesjak: I wouldn't -- I don't think I can add anything to that. I agree. I think that we will be roughly flat in constant currency, and then the key is going to be Enterprise Services. And we announced Deutsche Bank. We've already won in Q2 a couple of big deals. The other one's not public yet, but that is going to give us some help in the second half, as is the fact that the key account runoff that we've been talking about really abates in the second half of the year as we're getting largely through it. And so that also helps from a year-on-year compare perspective.
Margaret Whitman: I think you can think about it, Toni, as the bathtub, and the water is now going to stop draining out of the bathtub as fast as it has. So the water that we pour in ought to lead to a rising level in the tub. And I would say new logos, SCS, very strong, and -- but we've got to continue to execute.
Operator: The next question will come from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, in your cash flow discussion, you mentioned intra-month linearity in January as a factor impacting DSOs and therefore, free cash flow. And I wonder if you can expand on that, in part because other enterprise hardware companies have said in the month of January, they started to see delays in spending as global customers have to deal with the currency impact on their own business and therefore are delaying spending and revisiting their budget. And I just wonder whether you and Meg think that, that could be a risk that plays out this year.
Catherine Lesjak: So Katy, that's really not what we're hearing in terms of when we think about the quarter, it wasn't so much that we were seeing kind of enterprise customers delaying as a result of the currency. That's really not what we're hearing. We did see some softness in January overall in the PC business, and so the quarter was a bit more front-end loaded than what would be kind of our historical norm. But when you look at overall HP in January and then you look at what we had expected, and I think this is really important because when I was talking about the cash flow implication, it was really relative to our expectations around cash flow, we had expected a January that was better balanced first half to second half. And what we saw was actually a bit more that got shifted from the first half to the second half, and that impacted, obviously, DSO.
Margaret Whitman: And I'll just chime into that, Katy. We have a great channel from our sales force to us, and I'm out in the field all the time with customers. I'm not actually hearing that. Now that doesn't mean it won't turn up, but we're not hearing that people are delaying purchases because budgets are tightening and things like that.
Operator: The next question will come from Rod Hall of JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I just wanted to drill into the Networking commentary a little bit. You guys had said that I think you were a little bit disappointed in the performance in the quarter. You made some interesting announcements last week with regards to brite box switches. But you seem to be doing a lot of things in Networking. I just wonder if, Meg, you could maybe talk a little bit about the strategy there. Do you guys intend to consolidate the strategy around brite box? Do you intend to have a broad spectrum of product offering? Just help us understand how the strategy might be evolving there.
Margaret Whitman: Sure. So Networking is a very important business to HP. You will recall from a financial architecture perspective, Networking and Storage are margin accretive. And so these are important businesses to us, and we will continue to invest in these businesses. You're right, we had 2 execution challenges, one in China and one in the U.S. And I think we touched on those. The strategy here is exactly the same strategy in many ways that we've deployed with servers, which is a market segmentation strategy, what kind of customers want to buy what kind of gear, and then we need to have that for them. So for example, in servers, we have high-performance compute, and we have terrific data center switches and wired and wireless LAN products. But we also have benefited by having a hyperscale offering through our joint venture with Foxconn in the server business, which led to the thesis we should have a white box strategy for our Networking business because there's a lot of people for whom that is the solution that they prefer. And better for us to offer it and surround with other HP product and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We're very clear that we only play in businesses in which we can grow profitably. We have no interest in losing money in any business. And we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that we will make money there. So it is a market segmentation-based strategy where we have to have the right product with the right services attached that allows us to make money and gain share. So a rougher-than-anticipated quarter in Networking, it doesn't deter us. We just know we've got to make a couple changes to execute better.
Operator: The next question will come from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Meg, I wondered if you could talk about your Playing to Win framework. That's not something you've spoken about much. And from what I've heard about it, it sounds like it's fairly important, particularly to the discipline and execution of HP. Is that true?
Margaret Whitman: It is true, actually. The entire company has organized around Playing to Win, which is a book written by A.G. Lafley and a colleague of his. And listen, there's many ways to deploy strategy in companies. This is one that I have found to be particularly helpful because organizations have a lot of trouble making choices, particularly at our scale. So this notion of where to play, what countries, what market segments, what products and where not to play because we can't do it profitably has been a very good discipline. And actually Dion Weisler has led the way in Printing and Personal Systems. And then once you determine where you're going to play, how to win. And that is through a combination of where you're going to excel versus competitors. And it's actually been a really good common framework that we can apply across HP. It's easily understandable and actually forces the tough trade-offs. So listen, as I said, there's lots of ways to deploy strategy, but this has been particularly, I think, effective at HP because everyone speaks the same language now.
Operator: The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Cathie, can you just help us bridge the difference of the current free cash flow guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion versus the prior of $6.5 billion to $7 billion? Just help us quantify or understand the bridge and where did the $3 billion go to, because a lot of these timing things over a long term, whether it's inventory, payables or whatever, should kind of wash out. So if you can help us understand on a yearly basis where the $3 billion went.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. And Jim, you're absolutely right. The softness that we saw in free cash flow in Q1 was largely the result of timing and so we don't believe has an impact to the total year. So if we go -- if we start with the $6.5 billion to $7 billion, that was the outlook back in November. You then take into consideration the separation costs for our fiscal '15, which are $1.3 billion. You've got incremental foreign taxes net of credits in the year that are about $750 million of cash outflow. And then you've got the separation CapEx, which is about $300 million. And finally, you've got $0.30 a share for currency. And that takes you to the $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow for fiscal '15.
Jim Suva: Got you. So the original separation costs of $1.3 billion was not in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion?
Catherine Lesjak: That's right. And if you actually go back to this, we were pretty clear on the fact that we had not quantified and -- to the point where we were comfortable giving explicit guidance about what the separation costs were going to be 3 months ago. We actually have spent a tremendous amount of time kind of identifying and quantifying what that was going to be.
Jim Suva: Perfect clarification.
Margaret Whitman: The other thing I would -- I'm sorry, Jim, go ahead.
Jim Suva: I said that's perfect clarification. So it was really the add-on of separation costs and currency.
Catherine Lesjak: That's right. That's the only change that we've got to our outlook for free cash flow for the year. The base to start with is the $6.5 billion to $7 billion that we provided last quarter.
Operator: The next question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: I wanted to ask about your pricing commentary. The 19.2% margin in Printing doesn't seem indicative of a nasty pricing environment. It actually seems like the opposite. I know you got the yen flowing through there. But I wanted to understand the pricing comment better. Does that mean that Printing margins are really going to fall a lot due to pricing in upcoming quarters? And what does it really mean when you're balancing the fact that margins are at these historical highs and you're seeing this pricing pressure?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So we do think that the 19.2% profitability and, really, the profitability over the last quarter or 2 has been unsustainably high. And remember, the business model is we price printers at a loss in exchange for long-term annuity. But I've actually asked Dion Weisler to join us on the call today. And so Dion, you might comment a little bit about that.
Dion Weisler: Yes, I think you're quite right, Meg. We don't believe that 19% OP is good for the business long term, and therefore, it is not sustainable. And over the last several quarters, we've made real operational improvements. We've also had some cost benefits from the weakness of the yen, which is, of course, a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it helps us lower costs. On the other, our fierce Japanese competitors have leveraged the yen to be more aggressive on unit placement, which we need to respond to. So in order for us to maintain competitiveness, we need to invest some of these savings, and we'll do that really in 3 ways. Firstly, we'll be more aggressive in placing more units with a keen focus on placing high-value units that will drive future supplies growth. Secondly, we'll continue to expand our print sales specialist team to continue to drive growth in our managed print services business. And then finally, we'll invest in new technologies like PageWide array that fuels everything from the Officejet Pro X all the way through being the underpinning and underlying technology behind Multi Jet Fusion, which is, of course, the engine behind our 3D printers. So of course, we'll continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability, but we believe 19% operating profit is not good for business long term.
Catherine Lesjak: And I'd like to also add -- sorry, Ben, I'd like to also add that when you look at the benefit that we're getting explicitly from the weakness of the yen, in the back half of the year, that on a year-over-year basis is significantly reduced even at the current levels of exchange rates there. So we do expect that some of that benefit kind of moves away from us. The other thing, this is the only segment in Q1 where, overall, on a direct basis, they had a positive impact from currency. So again, IPG is a little different than other businesses. It's got the same top line and bottom line pressures from the strength of the dollar. It does have a benefit from the weakness of the yen, and then it does have to deal with Russia. But in Q1, the net currency impact was actually positive. We don't expect that, that continues in the rest of the year as the yen benefit basically moves away from us. And over time, we also hedge longer term, especially in the supplies area in IPG, and those hedges start to roll off as well.
Benjamin Reitzes: Yes, and the pricing hits are on the comp [ph], it sounds like, okay.
Margaret Whitman: Yes.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes.
Operator: The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Wamsi Mohan: Could you help us think through the dynamics of PC unit growth this year? For the quarter, obviously, the metrics look pretty strong, but I know you commented about January starting off weak. How are you expecting this to progress through the quarter and the year? And any geographic color there will be helpful.
Margaret Whitman: I'm sorry, I couldn't exactly hear you. The dynamics of the...
Catherine Lesjak: Are you looking for the PC -- what happened to PCs in January?
Dion Weisler: The long-term view, I think, was the question.
Catherine Lesjak: Okay, why don't you take that then.
Margaret Whitman: Was it -- okay, yes, Dion, you can talk about the long-term view that you have.
Dion Weisler: Yes. So look, I think in general, we're pretty aligned with the industry projections of the Personal Systems market, which suggests sort of low single-digit growth. We believe that PC units will be in small decline, but there are pockets of growth across the segments -- in some segments, including mobility, accessories and services. We've seen and expected the slowdown in the commercial segment following the XP refresh that fueled high-growth last year. However, we've seen, to counterbalance that, momentum in the consumer side of the business as consumers refresh their older PCs. So looking forward, the market remains competitive. We believe we can continue to gain share in the areas where we choose to play as the market consolidates. Specifically, we're sort of focused on profitable growth in 3 areas. Firstly, we're investing in key growth areas of convertibles, commercial mobility, accessories and services, where the heat is in the market. Secondly, we remain focused on extending our leadership in the commercial enterprise and SMB segments, including education. And then finally, we just continue to do the hard work of detailed customer segmentation and ensuring that we have the right price, value and cost equation set for each market.
Catherine Lesjak: And I would say that while we are maniacally focused on the commercial space in Q1, and what we're seeing is a little bit of a refresh in the consumer space.
Dion Weisler: Right.
Catherine Lesjak: And this is where being focused on profitable growth is really important. There's a lot of bad growth in consumer, but there's also good growth. And one of the things that I just want to make sure that people are clear on is that we don't get hung up on the margin rate. If we can go after good units in the consumer space across HP Stream, Bing, Chromebook, and we can deliver incremental margin dollars, then we'll go after that. And we definitely saw some real opportunities in Q1. It helped us gain pretty significant share on the consumer side while also driving some incremental profit dollars, obviously, at a much lower rate.
Operator: The next question will come from Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers: I wanted to ask you about the Industry Standard Servers segment and where we stand on the Grantley or the Gen9 server cycle. So what have you seen so far? Where are you at in that cycle? And what's your expectations for that product cycle relative to not just the Grantley cycle, but also the Windows Server expiration through the course of this year?
Catherine Lesjak: So specifically with respect to the Gen9, the ramp in Gen9 is off to a terrific start. It is actually one of the fastest ramps that we've seen. It's certainly ramping faster and better than Gen8. What we see in the product lineup in Gen9, which is different than Gen8, is that we've got basically -- we've got a great entry product all the way up to the high end. So we're very pleased with the progress. You saw that help drive a lot of growth in Industry Standard Servers, 9% year-over-year in constant currency. And we expect that, that will continue to ramp basically through the year. In terms of the kind of Windows 2003 refresh, it's starting, but it is not a material impact at this point. It's really just beginning. We do expect that, that will ramp as we go through fiscal '15, but it was not a major factor at all in the performance that we delivered in Industry Standard Servers this quarter. The combination of Gen9 and the refresh cycle makes us fairly bullish on Industry Standard Servers kind of throughout the rest of '15.
Margaret Whitman: And you might talk a little bit about the margin work we've done in that business.
Catherine Lesjak: True. Good point. We have done -- the margins have improved very significantly, the gross margins in Industry Standard Servers this quarter. We've done a great job of driving product cost down, taking advantage of some favorable commodity pricing as well. But it's really been hard work at driving the right cost structure combined with the opportunity to drive attach. So in ASPs, we've got double-digit increases in ASPs in Industry Standard Server. And that's because the Gen9 ProLiant server basically drives a lot of memory and storage attach, which is obviously great for margins.
Margaret Whitman: The last thing I'd say is I think we're really well positioned to take advantage of the Windows 2003 refresh just as we were from the XP migration in the PC business. I mean, we actually modeled the program after the XP program, and that has been helped by adjustments to our coverage models in the United States and APJ and Europe. So I'm with Cathie. I think we feel really pretty good about that business for the remainder of the year, and I think we're very well positioned, and the Gen9 server was dead on from a market perspective.
Operator: And the final question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Cathie, can you talk a bit about how we should think about free cash flow for '16? And what I was trying to figure out is you said $750 million for foreign tax. I think the total was $900 million. So would sort of the offset of the credits and the costs in '16 kind of balance themselves out? And then theoretically, restructuring somewhat through, so maybe we get back sort of more to that normal cadence of -- and I'm sure you probably don't want to put a number on it, but just to the extent that you can, give us some idea of puts and takes we should think about as we look to '16 since obviously were going to have to cut our '15 cash flow estimate pretty significantly.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So the biggest headwind to free cash flow this year over last year is the cash conversion cycle, basically going to back to 10 to 12 days. And I think it's important to understand that the reason why it goes back to 10 to 12 days is because we are taking what is now our strong balance sheet and leveraging that balance sheet to drive shareholder value by making trade-offs across the P&L and the balance sheet. That's what is driving the 10 to 12 days. But once we get to that 10 to 12 days, they year on year compare for '16 and that headwind is significantly reduced. So that's one of the big kind of tailwinds to cash flow. You're absolutely right, the separation costs are going to come down. So -- and the separation cost is anticipated to be $1.3 billion in fiscal '15 and about $500 million in fiscal '16. We don't think there's separation CapEx. The foreign taxes will turn to credits. I don't know how much were going to get in credits in fiscal '16, but certainly, you don't have the headwind of basically $750 million. So I think those are -- and then currency, we'll have to see what happens from a currency perspective, exactly what will happen. But obviously, you wouldn't have another step down unless the currency moves against us again.
Shannon Cross: And is there any change -- sorry, go ahead.
Margaret Whitman: No, I was just going to say, Shannon, and obviously, towards the end of the year, as we get close to actually the legal separation of these 2 companies, we'll be very explicit about the balance sheet that each company has and the earnings, revenue growth, free cash flow of each company. So as we head into '16, we'll be able to give you the kind of guidance that we gave when we were one company. We'll just do it for 2.
Shannon Cross: Any change to your cash usage this year, given the lower cash generation?
Catherine Lesjak: Are you specifically asking about capital allocation? Because I'd love to address that.
Shannon Cross: Yes, that was actually what I was asking.
Catherine Lesjak: So our commitment to basically provide at least 50% of our free cash flow this year back to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends is still intact. And in fact, if you do the math on Q1. In Q1, we repurchased shares to the tune of about $1.6 billion. About $750 million of that is basically making up for the shortfall that we had in '14 from our commitment. So we've got about $850 million done in share repurchase for fiscal '15. If you actually then look out over the course of the year and forecast what you think the dividends are going to be, you'll come pretty rapidly to the conclusion that we are at or darn close to hitting 50% of free cash flow already in terms of returns to shareholder. And what is important is that our guidance is -- and our commitment is at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders.
Margaret Whitman: Great. Well, thank you very much. I think we're out of time. Thank you very much for joining us. I think we feel very strongly that the turnaround is on track. There's progress. You can see it in terms of margin expansion across all the major lines of business. You can see it in growth in areas of the company that I think people were not sure we would turn around like Industry Standard Servers and PCs. So lots of progress, lots more work to do. And obviously, the macroeconomic environment, largely currency, is a headwind that disproportionately affects HP. But overall, we feel really good about the operational execution of the company. So thank you for joining us.
Operator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2014 Q4  (2014-11-25 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2014 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ellen, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Jim Bergkamp, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Jim Bergkamp: Good afternoon. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited to the execution of restructuring plans and any resulting cost savings or revenue or profitability improvements; any projections of revenue, margins, expense, earnings, earnings per share, HP effective tax rate, cash flow, share repurchases, currency exchange rates or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations including the separation transaction; and any statements concerning the expected development, performance, market share or competitive performance related to products or services. A discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions is set forth in more detail in HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including the tax-related items, reflect estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. Revenue, operating profit, operating margin, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share, income tax rate, cash and cash equivalents, operating cash flows, total company debt, capital expenditures and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items including, amongst other things, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available at the HP investor relations webpage at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Jim, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we exit the third year of our 5-year turnaround effort, I have to say that fiscal 2014 overall was a very strong year. Our performance came in right where it should be and we've delivered on our promises. We've reignited innovation across HP, strengthened our leadership, delivered cash flow above expectations, fortified our balance sheet and grown our non-GAAP earnings per share. And we finally stabilized our revenue trajectory, delivering flat top line revenue for the company on a constant currency basis for the full year. We've also made significant operational improvements across each of our businesses that are paying off in our improved profitability, customer and partner engagement and employee experience. In fact, we saw year-over-year operating margin expansion in every one of our businesses in the fourth quarter for the first time in many years. In addition, we once again delivered very strong cash flow in the quarter, generating $2.7 billion in cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.9 billion. For the full year, we delivered $9.3 billion in free cash flow, while returning $3.9 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As a result, our balance sheet now stands at an operating company net cash position of $5.9 billion, a significant improvement from the $11.8 billion of operating company net debt in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. And we once again achieved earnings per share at the high end of our previously provided outlook, delivering non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.06 for fiscal Q4, up 5% over the prior year, and $3.74 of non-GAAP earnings per share for the full year, also up 5%. We were able to deliver this performance while continuing to invest in the critical innovation that will be the foundation of HP's future. In fiscal 2014, we increased research and development spending by 10% over the prior year as we increased investment in every segment, including cloud, infrastructure, 3D printing, and of course, The Machine. Fiscal 2014 was a year of significant innovation for HP. We announced exciting new products and services across our businesses, and as we enter 2015, we have the strongest portfolio we've had in a decade. Earlier this year, we announced HP Helion, a portfolio of cloud products and services that enable organizations to build, manage and consume workloads in hybrid IT environments. In the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum in HP Helion with the acquisition of Eucalyptus, a provider of open source software for building private and hybrid enterprise clouds. Eucalyptus' CEO, Marten Mickos, joined HP as a Senior Vice President and General Manager of our cloud business. We also announced HP OpenNFV, a network functions virtualization technology initiative that will help communication service providers accelerate innovation and launch new services faster, more easily and with less expense. NFV represents one of the most significant shifts in the telecom industry in 20 years, and HP is very well positioned to capitalize on this shift. With open and agile architecture, such as our software-defined networking and Helion cloud technologies, we are leading the move away from monolithic purposed built products. In May, we announced the latest release of our HP Vertica Big Data analytics platform, a key component of HAVEn. It allows customers to store and explore data with the most sophisticated SQL on Hadoop capabilities, combined with advanced analytics and dynamic workload management. In June, we introduced the HP Apollo family of high-performance computing systems, capable of delivering up to 4x the performance of standard rack servers, while using less space and energy. This includes the Apollo 8000, an industry first liquid-cooled supercomputer that combines high level of processing power with ultralow energy usage. We also extended our Converged Storage portfolio with a solid-state optimized all-flash HP 3PAR StoreServ system. It delivers performance and low latency without compromising enterprise resiliency or adding data center complexity. In August, we announced our new portfolio of HP ProLiant Gen 9 servers. These servers are optimized for convergence, cloud and software-defined environments and deliver flexible, scalable computing resources that are aligned to customers' business goals. In September, we expanded our commercial PC portfolio with the launch of HP Z Desktops and ZBook mobile workstations. These powerful devices are built to address the constraints of compute-intensive industries like media and entertainment, graphic design and oil and gas explorations. And just last month, we announced our vision for the future of 3D printing and computing with our blended reality ecosystem. The first product available in this ecosystem, Sprout by HP, is a first of its kind immersive computing platform that combines the power of an advanced desktop computer with a scanner, depth sensor, high-resolution camera and projector into 1 seamless device. It is early days for this breakthrough technology, and it will take time to build the ecosystem, but interest has been very strong among developers, partners and customers. Also as part of this announcement, we unveiled HP Multi Jet Fusion, a revolutionary technology engineered to resolve the fundamental limitations in today's 3D printing. HP Multi Jet Fusion leverages our 30 years of expertise and intellectual property in Inkjet printing to develop a 3D printing solution that is 10x faster than even the best technologies in the market today, with better quality and lower cost. We have already begun engaging with customers and the feedback has been very strong, and we expect general availability in 2016. As I have said before, the innovation engine is now alive and well at HP, and I expect that our pace of innovation will only accelerate as we move into 2015. Last month, we made another significant announcement that I believe will help accelerate the progress we've already made in the turnaround. We plan to separate HP into 2 new market-leading independent publicly traded companies. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will lead the next generation of technology infrastructure, software and services for the New Style of IT. HP Inc. will be the leading personal systems and printing company, delivering innovations that will empower people to create, interact and inspire like never before. Both companies will have strong financial foundations, compelling innovation road maps, sharpened strategic focus and experienced leadership teams. And both will be well positioned to compete and win in today's rapidly changing, highly competitive environment. Over the past month since the announcement, I've met with hundreds of customers, partners and employees, and the feedback is overwhelmingly positive. They are excited about the potential of these 2 laser-focused companies that will each be leaders in their respective markets and what that can mean for their businesses and their careers. It's still early in the process but we have a compressive plan to ensure that we execute a successful separation with minimal disruption to the business. We have already established a separation management office tasked with driving the separation process, while allowing the company to continue to execute our FY '15 programs. As our results in the fourth quarter demonstrate, we have been able to begin this process with minimal disruption. We'll be giving regular updates on the progress of the separation on each of these quarterly calls. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q4 were driven by strong performance in Personal Systems, Industry Standard Servers and Networking, as well as disciplined cost management across all of our businesses. In Personal Systems, we had an excellent performance with our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, up 4% over the prior year. For the full year, revenue was up 7%, despite having a tough comparison due to the Uttar Pradesh deal in Q4 of last year. We gained share across commercial, consumer, desktop and notebooks and expect that we will continue to gain share as the overall PC market continues to consolidate. In Printing, we had another strong quarter of profitability, while revenue was down 5%, primarily driven by supplies revenues. For the full year, revenue was down 4% over the prior year. We are seeing some competitive pricing in this business with some competitors using movement in the yen to price more aggressively. Overall, hardware units declined 1% over the prior year. Commercial hardware units were up 5% but disciplined focus on profitable units resulted in declines in consumer hardware, specifically low-value home printers. We continue to see momentum in our focus areas, with strong unit growth in value multifunction printers, where we are now the market leader; graphics products, particularly in our Indigo printers where we extended our leadership position and TCV growth in our managed print services business. Dion and his team have been addressing the challenges in this business and have moved quickly to get the supplies channel inventories we identified last quarter back in line with our target range. Overall, unit placement trends and supplies growth will take some time to optimize, but the team has an aggressive plan in place to address this, including targeted marketing programs and hiring on more supply specialists. With these activities, along with a very strong innovation pipeline, I'm confident that Dion is setting this business up for success. In Enterprise Group, Q4 revenue declined 4% year-over-year and full year revenue was down 1%. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance with solid execution in Industry Standard Servers and continued growth in Networking, partially offsetting declines in storage, Business Critical Systems and Technology Services. Over the past several quarters, we've made significant progress in our ISS business. Although revenue in the quarter was down 2% year-over-year, normalizing for the large hyper-scale deal in Q4 of last year, sales grew across all regions. We've improved our cost structure in this business, driving profitability, while at the same time attacking the market with new innovative solutions and aggressive marketing. We're continuing to see incremental opportunities from the IBM server sale to Lenovo. Business Critical Systems revenue continue to decline in the quarter, but we are excited about the HP NonStop x86 platform that we are currently testing with customers, as well as new Big Data converged solutions that are already generating revenue. Looking into Q1, we expect to see the benefit of our focus on driving innovation in this segment. The storage market continued its shift towards the mid-tier from the high end and our storage revenue declined 8% year-over-year. However, we remain very well positioned with our 3PAR platform, which grew year-over-year, and we expect to gain share as the market moves to the mid-tier. Networking continued to perform well, with revenue up 2% year-over-year driven by strong growth in switching. We saw good performance in China, but the market there remains very competitive. Technology Services revenue declined 3% year-over-year, driven by hardware declines in BCS and storage, but we continue to maintain stable operating margins, and we are seeing signs of continued adoption of our new offerings, including Datacenter Care, Flexible Capacity Services and Proactive Care. In Enterprise Services, we continue to make progress in turning around this long-cycle business but we still have more work to do. As expected, Q4 revenue was down 7% year-over-year, with a full year decline of just under 7%. As we highlighted previously, key account revenue runoff, as well as weakness in EMEA, negatively impacted year-over-year revenue comparisons. Profitability steadily improved through the year due to continued labor savings and improvements in underperforming accounts. Total bookings for the year were down but the quality of the bookings was better. We had solid growth in Strategic Enterprise Services signings as well as new logo bookings and increased new logo win rates. In Software, solid execution led to improved profitability and a return to growth in our license business in Q4. Overall, Software revenue was flat in constant currency. Revenue grew in our focus areas of security and Big Data, both in the quarter and for the full year, with Vertica revenue growing high double digits in Q4. We continue to make progress on SaaS bookings as we shift the focus on both our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings. So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. The sharp focus on our fundamental operations, including supply chain, go-to-market and cost structure is clearly paying off in our strong profitability across the company. We expect these improvements to continue into FY '15. On the top line, I've always said that turnarounds aren't linear and while we are seeing clear pockets of growth, other areas still need more work. But overall, our revenue performance has improved dramatically over the past 3 years, and I believe our progress to date will be accelerated by the separation we've outlined. Against that backdrop, our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter will be $0.89 to $0.93, and for the full year, will be $3.83 to $4.03. So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this quarter. Revenue was as expected across most of the portfolio, especially considering 2 major deals in the fourth quarter of last year that makes the tough compares. Profitability was strong with year-over-year rate increases in each of our business segments, in large part due to the operational improvements we've implemented over the last few years. We expect these improvements to continue into fiscal 2015, and cash flow for Q4 topped off what was already a strong year. Total net revenue for the quarter was $28.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year or 3% in constant currency. Fiscal 2014 net revenue was $111.5 billion, down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.6%, up 1.6 points year-over-year and 0.6 points sequentially. Over the prior-year period, we experienced rate improvements across all of our major business segments partially offset by competitive pricing in hardware and an unfavorable mix impact on the strength of Personal Systems. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by investments in R&D and go-to-market. Sequentially, OpEx was down 1%, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2.7 billion or 9.6% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year and 1.1 points sequentially. We recorded $146 million of expense on the other income and expense line, with the 22.4% non-GAAP tax rate and a weighted average diluted share count of 1.9 billion shares. We delivered fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.06. Full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $3.74, up 5% year-over-year and at the high end of our outlook range. Fourth quarter non-GAAP net earnings primarily excludes pretax charges of $604 million for restructuring and $226 million for the amortization of intangible assets. Full year non-GAAP net earnings primarily excludes pretax charges of $1.6 billion for restructuring and $1 billion for the amortization of intangible assets. While we began to work on the separation in Q4, associated costs were not material and are included in our results. We plan to treat separation costs as GAAP-only beginning in Q1 '15. By region in the quarter. Americas revenues was $12.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year, largely due to declines in the U.S. We faced some execution challenges, a tough compare in the Enterprise Group and continued key account runoff in Enterprise Services, but the U.S. economy continued to expand and we ended the quarter with strong backlog in Industry Standard Servers. EMEA revenue was $10.2 billion, flat year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. The Western European region continued to grow, while we experienced declines in Russia and Central Eastern Europe. APJ revenue was $5.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency. We saw softness in Japan which contributed to about half of the regional decline. And as Meg mentioned, had a tough compare in India related to the large PC deal won in the same period last year. Turning to the business segments. We had another strong quarter in Personal Systems where the team continued to execute well and delivered growth in revenue and profit while gaining unit share across all key segments. Revenue was $8.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Commercial sales grew 7% year-over-year, and we regained the #1 unit share position in commercial notebooks. Consumer sales declined 2%, but demand remains strong with growth in EMEA and the Americas. As you heard from Meg, this was a great year of innovation and we have a very strong product lineup. For example, with our x360 platform, we achieved a 12-point unit share gain in the high-growth convertible notebook market, taking over the #1 position worldwide. Overall, total PC unit shipments grew 5% year-over-year and we ended the quarter with channel inventory well within our target range. Operating profit of $355 million or 4% of revenue was up 0.9 points year-over-year as the team continued to segment and target the right market opportunities as well as streamline operational costs across the business. Print performed largely as expected with total revenue of $5.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven primarily by supplies. Overall supplies revenue was $3.6 billion, down 7% over the prior year period due to softer demand and a reduction in channel inventory. As a result, we ended the quarter with ink and toner supplies channel inventory well within our target range. Total hardware unit shipments declined 1% year-over-year, partly driven by low-end home printers, offset by continued growth and share gains in our strategic focus areas of high-value units. We retained our #1 market share position in value multifunction printers overall, and for color and mono. Also, Ink in the Office hardware units grew double digits year-over-year with triple digit growth in OfficeJet Pro X printers. Total Printing operating profit remained strong at $1 billion or 18.1% of revenue, up 0.2 points year-over-year. Enterprise Group top line performance was mixed with revenue of $7.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year. While we need to improve sales execution in Storage, most of the other business units performed well and overall operating profit improved to $1.1 billion or 14.8% of revenue, up 0.4 points year-over-year. Within EG, the Industry Standard Server business continued to gain traction. Revenue was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Sales grew in EMEA and Asia, and while Americas revenue declined, we exited the quarter with strong order backlog, including our new Gen 9 ProLiant servers. Technology Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by hardware revenue declines in Business Critical Servers and Storage. Total penetration rates declined, while improving across BCS and traditional Industry Standard Servers, and gross margin performance remained strong in this business. Storage revenue was $878 million, down 8% year-over-year. The market continued to shift from the high-end to the midrange in entry-level storage solutions, and we saw this shift reflected in the strong growth of our 3PAR midrange offering. We're continuing to see positive growth overall in 3PAR, although Converged Storage declined 3% year-over-year. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA revenue declined 6% year-over-year. We expect our external disk results to be largely in line with the market for calendar Q3. Networking revenue was $669 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong switching growth. We saw good performance in China in the quarter, specifically in the data center, although competitive pressures increased and we expect that to continue going forward. Business Critical Servers revenue declined 29% year-over-year to $238 million. Enterprise Services revenue was $5.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued key account runoff. Full fiscal 2014 revenue was $22.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year, within the outlook range we updated last quarter. Overall, while there is more work to do to improve performance in ES, we made significant progress building out the instrumentation to more effectively run this business. By business unit, IT outsourcing revenue was $3.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year, and applications and business services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6%. Strategic Enterprise Services or services for the New Style of IT grew revenue double digits. Overall for ES, we saw strong growth in new logos. The new logo total contract value was the highest it has been in over 3 years. We finished the year with a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. The business continued to deliver productivity improvements, and the operating profit for ES was $374 million or 6.8% of revenue, up 47% year-over-year. Full year operating profit was 3.6%, within the previously provided outlook range. Now turning to Software. We started to see the benefits of the work the Software team has been doing to strengthen our portfolio and go-to-market approach. Software revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency with a strong operating profit of $338 million or 31.1% of revenue, up 0.9 points year-over-year. License revenue improved, growing 2% year-over-year, driven by strength in Vertica and good recovery in the IT management category, particularly our application development management portfolio. Support revenue declined 1% year-over-year and professional services sales declined 5% as we strategically focused on higher-margin engagements. SaaS revenue was flat year-over-year, but we continue to see momentum in our new SaaS offerings. Service Anywhere and Propel products are winning in the marketplace, driving year-over-year and sequential IT operations management bookings growth. We also saw double-digit SaaS bookings growth in security. HP Financial Services revenue was $906 million, down 1% year-over-year and operating profit was $110 million or 12.1% of revenue. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. For fiscal 2014, the HP Financial Services return on equity was 18%. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. In Q4, we generated $2.7 billion in operating cash flow and $1.9 billion in free cash flow. Our cash conversion cycle was 4 days -- down 4 days sequentially, driven by improvements in day sales outstanding and days payable outstanding. DSO was down 2 days from Q3. Normal sequential seasonality was more than offset by strength of collections and currency movements. DPO was up 2 days from Q3 due to extended payment terms and business mix. This cash conversion cycle is not at a sustainable level and is below our expectation of 10 to 12 days for fiscal 2015. We repurchased 21.7 million shares in the quarter and paid $309 million in dividends, returning approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders in Q4. For fiscal 2014, we returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. This is below the 50% of free cash flow target we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we intend to make up the difference in fiscal 2015. The restructuring program remained on track and approximately 41,000 people exited the company by the end of our fiscal year. Overall, our full year results reflect the progress we've made on improving our cost structure across the company to enable the right investments for the future. As we said in October, it is because of these foundational improvements that the planned separation will be done from a position of strength. Looking forward to Q1. In Personal Systems, we expect to leverage the strength of our product lineup to continue to gain share in a consolidating market. Commercial PC growth is likely to further moderate as the XP refresh is now largely complete. In Printing, we intend to place high-value hardware units for both laser and ink, improving the quality of our installed base and the supplies attached. We expect graphics and managed print services to continue to be growth drivers for the business. In the Enterprise Group. Overall, the hardware market is likely to remain highly competitive. In Industry Standard Servers, we expect some momentum going into Q1 from the sales ramp of our Gen 9 portfolio, as well as Apollo and cloud line platforms. Keep in mind that the large hyper-scale deal from last year that Meg previously highlighted shipped largely in Q4 '13 and Q1 '14. In Storage, we will continue to focus on driving growth in the 3PAR portfolio, including all-flash arrays in order to outpace declines of older technology. We will continue to leverage our differentiation across the Networking portfolio, including software-defined networking, to drive share gains. In Enterprise Services, we expect to deliver results to support the full year fiscal 2015 outlook provided in October. In Q1, we anticipate operating profit will decline sequentially due to normal seasonality and key account runoff. In Software, we continue to align with customer demands and shift our product development resources and go-to-market focus towards SaaS and subscription-based offerings. This shift may create near-term revenue headwinds but will set us up for long-term success. From a macroeconomic perspective, we expect geopolitical uncertainty to continue, impacting specific territories such as Russia, as well as increased competitive pressures in China. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations is expected to continue to be a headwind as we move into fiscal 2015. As we said on our October 5 call, we expect the headwind to be approximately 2 points to as-reported revenue on a year-over-year basis. With that context, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share range of $3.83 to $4.03. For fiscal Q1, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.93. From a GAAP perspective, we are reaffirming our full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.23 to $3.43. And GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q1 is expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. This GAAP outlook does not include separation charges. On the Q1 2015 earnings call, we are planning to provide more information about Q1 and full year separation charges. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: First, a question for Cathie. Now that you're back to target inventory levels in printer supplies, how should we think about growth going forward and also your ability to keep the margins at 18% in light of supplies mix perhaps improving?
Catherine Lesjak: So Katy, good question. I think Meg will give maybe a little bit of a view on supplies on a go-forward basis, but I would say that overall, we expect that the ink supplies will really start to stabilize and maybe grow a little bit, and that toner supplies will begin or continue stabilizing into '15, but probably not grow until '16.
Margaret Whitman: So Katy, let me give you a -- maybe pull the lens back all the way and talk about our Printing business. As you know, we have really 3 businesses: we've got Inkjet, laser jet and then our graphics business. And the good news is graphics is performing very well, high single-digit growth for much of the year, middle single-digit growth for Q4. Inkjet is performing largely as expected. While we've experienced some decline in the home computer market -- or the home consumer printer market, basically we're growing SMB and Ink in the Office and a number of our initiatives are doing quite well in the ink business. The challenges are the greatest on the laser side of the business, and there's 2 things going on here. One is we made the same hardware decision as in ink to place those high-value units, which lead to greater attach long term, which I think is a smart move. On the toner side, I think the declines can be attributed to the clones and the remands attacking on our aging installed base, which we've been fixing over time but we still have an aging installed base. I think the good news is we are all over this challenge. And we're focusing on our high-value MFPs, where we outperform the market. We've got a great Managed Print Services business, where we're now #2 in the market from #4 a couple of years ago, and we're launching a new R series of products with new technology to combat the clones. So ink, good; graphics, great; and toner is our challenge in laser but we are all over it.
Catherine Lesjak: And specifically around your comment around margins in '15, very much the same as margins in '14, and so we're very focused on our cost initiatives and driving the appropriate productivity. We have seen favorable currency obviously in '14 that was very significant. In '15, that favorable currency position from yen weakening does mute a bit because we are anniversary-ing it. But we do continue to expect to see some incremental gains from yen in fiscal '15.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Meg, in the press release, you mentioned the potential to accelerate the progress of the turnaround in fiscal '15 and beyond. Can you just talk about, is that referencing accelerated revenue performance, accelerated cost performance? And how much of that is dependent on getting the spin done in the second half versus a foundation that's already been laid?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So, Katy, let me give you a perspective here. We have made a lot of progress over the last 3 years on a couple of dimensions. One is we have firmly stabilized the revenue in this business. We were flat year-over-year, which is not what we aspire to, but from whence we came with high single-digit revenue growth, we're feeling pretty good about that. We have also done a good job on the cost side. You saw that we expanded margins in every single business in the fourth quarter, which has not happened since May of 2012. So we need to keep doing what we're doing. We need to continue to accelerate the pockets of growth that we have. We need to mitigate the declines in some of our businesses, legacy products, whether it be tape or others, and we need to continue to double down on the innovation engine. I'm really proud that we increased R&D by 10% year-over-year. We haven't done that in a very long time. So I think we're poised to do well in 2015. We expect flat revenue in 2015 in constant currency. If it were not for the 2-point currency headwind that Cathie described, we'd actually grow a bit. But every major U.S. company is going to be facing a pretty significant currency headwind, and we are no exception to that. And then we feel good about the margin expansion. So right where we thought we'd be on the turnaround, and obviously the point of the separation is that we will accelerate that going into 2016.
Operator: The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I just wanted to follow up and ask Cathie if you still feel comfortable with your cash flow guidance for fiscal '15. And along with that, if you still expect to deliver 50% of that back to shareholders. And as part of that, what type of share count should we expect in the first quarter, given a lot of the buybacks happened later in the quarter?
Catherine Lesjak: So thanks, Sherri. Yes, I still expect that our cash conversion cycle is going to be in the 10- to 12-day range for fiscal '15. And part of that is the result of things that happened in the fourth quarter that are not sustainable. For example, we did have a currency benefit to the cash conversion cycle in the fourth quarter that actually isn't real cash. And I'm sure most of you just said, "What is she talking about?" But what happens is that we actually hedge our balance sheet around the world. We hedge them at a net monetary asset basis and we book it through OI&E. We don't hedge accounts receivable separate from accounts payable, and so we're getting what looks like an artificial cash flow impact from DSO. So really, if you really think about the fourth quarter, it's really at about 6 days. We've got some linearity in there from purchasing and sales that is not sustainable going into '14 -- I'm sorry, into '15, and then we also have business mix impacts. Because as you guys know, the Personal Systems Group generates a very negative cash conversion cycle, which is great. But as that business becomes less mix for us and the EG and Enterprise Services becomes more, which has a higher cash conversion cycle, there's upward pressure. And then finally, I think one of the really important things is that we've done a great job of getting our balance sheet in good shape and our working capital in great shape. And now the opportunity is there for us to take advantage of cash discounts when it makes economic sense, put inventory on both when it makes economic sense and frankly make some strategic buys when it makes sense. And that will put upward pressure for all the right reasons on the cash conversion cycle in '15.
Margaret Whitman: And with regard to returning 50% of cash flow to investors in the form of dividends and share repurchase, that stands, that is our objective for 2015. And given where the share price is, you'll see us weight that towards share purchase.
Catherine Lesjak: And therefore, you should expect a moderate decline in shares outstanding over the course of '15.
Sherri Scribner: Okay. And just to follow-up, you're still comfortable with the $6.5 billion to $7 billion free cash flow guidance for fiscal '15?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, we are.
Operator: And the next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have one for Cathie and I think one for Meg. Cathie, I just was wondering if you could help us frame the cost savings opportunity in fiscal '15 versus fiscal '14. My sense is that the gross cost savings opportunity is actually several hundred dollars bigger -- several hundred million dollars bigger in fiscal '15 than in fiscal '14. And I was wondering if you could comment on if fiscal '14 was, let's say, $1.4 billion in gross savings, whether you could comment on how much of that you reinvested versus fell to the bottom line? And how we should be thinking about that on a relative basis for fiscal '15? How are you thinking about reinvestment versus savings capture relative to this year?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So Toni, let me start with just a restructuring update so that everybody is on the same page. So from a restructuring perspective, we did end fiscal '14 as we expected. We had about 41,000 employees leave under the program in fiscal '14. We took a GAAP-only charge in '14 of about $1.6 billion, and we had a cash outflow of about $1.5 billion. That generated gross savings in the year of $3.5 billion. And then if you look at -- or you go back to the announcement we made at the beginning of October, we increased the number of employees impacted from 45,000 to 50,000. And the savings from that, the net savings from that increase, we are investing back into R&D and go-to-market. For fiscal '15, we do expect that we will have that full amount of 55,000 employees leave under the program, that the GAAP charge will be down significantly to about $600 million, and that the cash outflow [ph] impact will also be down by about $500 million and the gross savings will be up to $5.3 billion. Now to your point, a fairly large chunk of that gets reinvested back in -- frankly, in work that gets migrated as we adjust our global footprint. Some obviously goes back into investing into R&D and sales and some will drop to the bottom line.
Toni Sacconaghi: And Cathie, can you help qualitatively about how we should think about that relative reinvestment rate for '15 versus '14, or is that discretionary depending on how the year goes?
Catherine Lesjak: I think it's a little discretionary. But we put a significant amount of that back in -- when you think about those incremental 10,000 folks and the savings that we're going to get in the year, on a net basis, that is going back into R&D and sales.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And then Meg, you sound consistently confident about the stabilization in revenue and -- in the opportunity for -- or expectation for flattish revenue growth at constant currency in '15. And I was just wondering what dynamic you see changing? So I look at '14, and you had quite easy comparisons on the revenue side. And then in Q4, your comparison was about minus 3 and revenues grew about minus 3 at constant currency. When we look to fiscal '15, your comparison at constant currency is about 0, so it's actually tougher and you're expecting much better growth than you saw in Q4. So I was wondering if you can comment on whether you actually think the environment will improve in fiscal '15 relative to what we saw in fiscal '14, or whether there were unique performance challenges in '14 that you don't think will repeat. Or if we just try and think of a more analogous, tougher compare, which is Q4, it doesn't necessarily follow that getting to flat revenue growth in a similar spending environment necessarily happens. So maybe you can help me with your view on what drives that.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. Sure, Toni. So first, I would say, from a macroeconomic point of view, we don't expect much change across the globe, with the exception of the United States, which does seem to be strengthening in a way that is different from the last 3 years. Second, I would say much of this performance that we expect from a revenue perspective in 2015 is driven by the fact that we are stronger. Every business is stronger. Every market position that we are in is a bit stronger. Our innovation roadmap is the strongest we have had really across the board, whether that is our PC lineup, our new range of R series printers, our next generation of servers, our Mission Critical x86 servers, all-flash array in our storage business, SDN in networking, across the board. We've got 2 new great products in our IT management suite in Software. So feel great about that part of the business. Everyone -- every business is stronger. ES, we are planning to have a slower decline in revenue in 2016 -- in 2015 than we did in 2014 or 2013. So while we still anticipate ES will shrink in 2015, it will be at a slower rate. And probably the biggest swing factor to growing the company will be what happens in ES revenue. And I'm encouraged on 2 points. One is our new logo performance is the best it's been in a number of years. Our win rates are up. We're being invited to RFPs and to opportunities much more frequently than we were in the past, and we have a higher win rate. We have to continue to sell our in-year sell and build to our existing customers. So Cathie, I don't know if you would agree with me, but I'd say probably ES is the biggest swing factor in terms of the growth projection that we've put out for 2015.
Catherine Lesjak: So I think that ES -- I also think EG has just an incredible amount of innovation that's coming to market. We've got our Gen 9 ProLiant server that launched in August. We've got our Apollo series platform that's launched. And we have just an incredible lineup for the year that I think is -- it gives us some real upside in EG as well.
Margaret Whitman: And the Windows Server 2003 refresh.
Catherine Lesjak: Exactly, for the server space there, too.
Operator: The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Meg, can you comment on what your appetite for M&A is during the transition process now that we -- I mean, you've been buying back stock the whole quarter, so it looks like your plans might have changed over the last 90 days, if you could just update us there. And then also, did you detect any disruption at all in any of your business due to the announced transition and breakup, particularly in the Enterprise Group? And how are you managing that and making sure that everything goes smoothly?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So with regard to M&A, we still remain interested in acquiring assets that are the right thing for either what will become Hewlett-Packard Inc. or HP Inc. and what will become Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. But as always, and we've been consistent on this, this is returns-based, we remain disciplined and we won't do things that are not in the best interest of shareholders. So I wouldn't say that it's changed dramatically, but we remain on the same sort of philosophy of M&A. With regard to disruption, I'm actually happy to report that I don't think we saw any disruption in the fourth quarter. And we are approaching the separation, I think, in a very good way. First is we have some of our most talented executives running the separation, and that is what they are doing full time. And at its peak, that will probably be between 400 and 500 people. The rest of HP, all 275,000 of the rest, will be, in fact, focused on running the business. And so I have a lot of confidence that we'll be able to deliver FY '15, which is critical because the most important thing we can do to get these 2 companies off on their own is deliver this year while we execute the separation. This is a big and complicated separation. It is the biggest separation that's ever been done. And it's not a typical spinoff where you've got one big company spinning off a little part of the company. These are 2 Fortune 50 companies that, as I've said, at separation both have about $57 billion of revenue. So it's big and it's complex, but we've got the right people on it. And I'm really heartened by how we have approached this. This is HP at its best, execution machine on the separation.
Catherine Lesjak: And the other thing that I would say is that as we were entering into the fourth quarter, we obviously had some expectations about what we thought revenue would do. And this was before we announced the separation. And the revenue actually came in a bit better. So top line was better. And that's even in an environment in which currency moved against us to the tune of several hundred million dollars. So continuing to feel very confident that we can execute in fiscal '15, while we are separating the company.
Margaret Whitman: And let me just give you a little color of customers and partners. So we communicated with 38,000 customers and 69,000 partners in the first 18 hours after the announcement. It's kind of amazing, but we were in a military style of communication. And then post that, all the senior executives have met with hundreds of customers and partners. And I would have to say that almost universally, they're enthusiastic about this. They think it's going to be good for them, good for their business because we'll have 2 more focused companies that have an ability to react faster to the marketplace and meet their customer needs more -- in a more focused way. And that, of course, because the customers have reacted well, that has actually sort of encouraged our employees. They're now kind of excited saying, "Wow, this is going to give us a chance to be more nimble and to win more in the marketplace." So I think this has gone as well as it could have gone. I'm really pleased with the communications, pleased with the reaction and pleased with the rallying of our employees across the globe.
Operator: The next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: So you've now put senior leadership in place to manage the separation of the 2 companies. Can you just talk about what the immediate mandates are, what the next steps are? And then also, whether you have any thoughts on potential incremental synergies, where that might be coming from and if there's any way how we might be able to frame the magnitude today.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So the intermediate -- the immediate mandate, and I'll go into a little bit of detail here, is there is a corporate separation management office who is tasked with creating 3 years of historic financials for each of the different businesses which, of course, we do not have because we've been together. Second is very detailed analysis of tax and legal separation. We have over 786 legal entities at this company, all of which have to be looked at and rationalized. Then we have a separation management office for each of the businesses, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and their job is to make sure that we got the right strategy with the right cost structure as we head into being 2 separate companies. And there is also, obviously, the separation of IT that needs to take place. And that will give us an opportunity to create an IT infrastructure for each company that isn't based on our legacy IT system and isn't based on a manufacturing system which, for so many years, it has been. So those are the immediate mandates. And it seems to be going well. We've got deadlines every month on things that have to be decided, decisions that have to be made and operations that have to be changed. With regard to incremental synergies, I'll let Cathie take a crack at that. What I will say is the separation was totally the right thing to do for this company. It will, as I said, make us more customer-focused, but it also gives us a chance to clean sheet 2 new Fortune 50 companies. And it is remarkable how it focuses the mind around overhead, around do we need exactly what we have today? Because what we are not doing is separating the company into 2 pieces exactly as it is today. We are using this opportunity to really think through how we start -- knowing what we know now, and if you had a chance to restart these 2 Fortune 50 companies, how will you organize? And that has been a really interesting and I think going to be really good for both these companies.
Catherine Lesjak: So I don't have a specific number for you, we're still working through this. We're working through, frankly, also the cost of the separation, which we will give an update on our earnings call in Q1. But I'll reiterate something Meg said, maybe a little bit differently. This is an opportunity to do 0-based budgeting, as close as you can get to 0-based budgeting for 2 Fortune 50 companies because every line item needs to be reviewed, every balance sheet item needs to be reviewed in order to do this split. And so it's a huge opportunity for us to really take a different perspective with our cost structure.
Margaret Whitman: And the ability to rethink go-to-market, supply chain, customer support, warranty, I mean, we're just going through every single thing. And by the way, we've been doing that for 3 years. There is a huge amount more opportunity, which I think is also exciting to people because in this day and age and, what I'd call, the new style of business, your cost structure is an absolutely necessary part of being able to compete in a global environment.
Operator: The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: I have questions for Meg and for Cathie, both really around the next year's revenue outlook. For you, Meg, first of all, going back about 2 years, you published a slide which talked about sustained growth from fiscal year '15 onwards for the business. Obviously, a lot has changed in the last 2 years, and I acknowledge that. But are we at the point whereby -- I know you've talked about some moderate level of growth this year, but it doesn't sound you're that convinced it's going to be sizable. Are we at the point whereby just going forward, you are confident it can be a growth company even if it's low single digits? And what are the key product areas that we should be tracking to monitor that progress, do you think? And just for Cathie, on the -- one thing you said earlier on, on the free cash flow question was that you implied that PSG may actually decline or may be able to go down in the mix. But I thought a few weeks ago, at the analyst meeting, you implied the PC industry may contract, but HP's PC business wouldn't contract because you've gained share. Does that not stand anymore? Or have I misunderstood? I just want some clarification there.
Margaret Whitman: So let me talk about FY '15. As I said, we would grow this year, in my view, if we didn't have the currency headwind. But listen, there's puts and takes in every business. I think the revenue will be about flat in constant currency this year. And again, we have made a huge amount of progress. There's been tremendous changes in the marketplace over the last 3 years, but I feel good about having stabilized the revenue. Now I think the question you're asking is, do we think 2 separate companies will grow in 2016? And it is too early to give you that guidance. As we come closer to the end of this year, we will give a lot more detail about HP Inc. and about Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. And we will be out with investors, much like an IPO roadshow, as we get closer to the separation. But at the highest level, one of the principles, one of the philosophies behind this separation is both companies will actually do better separately than they would have combined. And that's because cost structure, focus, real attunement to customer needs and the marketplace changes. So the thesis very much is to go from year 3 to year 5 of this turnaround, we're going to make progress as separate companies than we would have had we kept this together.
Catherine Lesjak: And Kulbinder, my comment was really around the long-term sustainability of the cash conversion cycle at 4 days. And so we do -- would expect that had we kept together, that over time, the PC business would -- mix would decline, and that the Enterprise Services and EG mix would increase.
Operator: The final question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: A couple of questions. One on the Services side, I just want to make sure I heard this right, did you say book-to-bill was 0.9 this quarter, because I think it was 1 the quarter prior. And could you just talk about what your operating margin expectation for Services through fiscal '15, given you've had pretty good expansion in '14?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Yes, I did say that the book-to-bill was 0.9. We had hoped to exit the year at 1. We did have a rather large deal slip into next year; if it weren't for that, we would have gotten to 1, but we did end at 0.9. In terms of the Enterprise Services margins, what we laid out for you, I think it was on the October call, was that the margins in fiscal '15 would expand from the 3.6% that we did in '14 to between 4% and 6%.
Margaret Whitman: With long-term margin expansion, as we've said for a couple years, between 7% and 9%.
Catherine Lesjak: Right. With top line growth of 3% to 5% long term.
Amit Daryanani: Yes. And if I could just maybe follow up on China, a couple of weeks ago, Meg, you made some comments about China being potentially soft, especially in the Networking side. Can you just talk about what are you seeing there? Is it very much isolated in networking or is it a broader issue you're seeing that it's tougher to do business in China across HP versus just Networking?
Margaret Whitman: So in China in the fourth quarter, we saw growth in Enterprise Group, in Services and in Printing, but we also saw an increase in a very aggressive pricing, especially in Networking. And overall, in China, HP was flat year-over-year. And we continue to run China with a single business leader, Bob Mao, who reports directly to me, and he's driving really an overall united strategy and go-to-market approach across what will become Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So it's a little different than the way we run the rest of the world and I think that's working for us. That said, it is a very competitive environment and it is competitive with Chinese players as well as other global players. It is probably our most competitive market in the world, so we have to be on our toes there. And we are very focused on in China, for China. What we've learned, and I've learned in my previous career is you've got to have products that are right for the Chinese market with the distribution model that is right for the Chinese market. And if you did not do these 2 things, you will end up not performing as well as you might have in China. So I think we've got the right approach to China, it is a very competitive market, but I think we're doing as well as any other major global competitor at the moment in China. Great. Okay. Thank you very much for listening, and thank you for joining us this afternoon.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2014 Q3  (2014-08-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2014 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Leslie, and I'll be your conference moderator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer.

The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The third quarter of 2014 marks an important milestone in HP's turnaround. For the first time in 3 years, the company delivered top line revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. Revenue for the company was $27.6 billion, up 1%. As I've said many times before, turnarounds are not linear, and we face some tough comparisons in the fourth quarter. But overall, I continue to be very encouraged by the progress we're making. In the third quarter, we once again achieved our financial outlook. We delivered $0.89 in diluted non-GAAP net earnings per share at the high end our previously provided outlook and up $0.03 from the prior year period. In addition, we achieved very strong cash flow performance, delivering $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the quarter, a good sign of improved operations and financial discipline. Our year-to-date free cash flow now stands at $7.4 billion. As a result, our operating company net cash position is $4.9 billion. We also returned $881 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We're seeing the benefits of the work we've done to get our Personal Systems and Industry Standard Server business back on track. Our Printing Supplies business and parts of our Software portfolio still face some challenges, but HP today is nimbler and better prepared than ever to respond to rapidly changing business conditions, so the leadership teams in both these areas are quickly addressing those challenges. On the Enterprise Services side of the company, we're making progress. The nature of ES with longer business cycles and lengthy contract periods make it tough to realize improvements quickly, but I believe the changes Mike Nefkens and his team are making are beginning to take hold. I'm confident that Enterprise Services is on the right path to improved performance and profitability. The third quarter saw the introduction of some significant innovation across HP. At our Discover customer event in June, we launched the world's first completely liquid-cooled supercomputer, HP Apollo. Apollo offers high-performance computing while using half the energy of competitive products. We also introduced an all-flash HP 3PAR storage array. 3PAR is making all-flash arrays viable for a range of mainstream enterprises and service providers, driving down cost while also boosting performance and scale. Initial customer reaction has been very positive. Our Software group announced new HP Atalla encryption and data protection solutions that continuously secure an organization's most sensitive information, whether it resides in a data center, an on-premise server or in the cloud. And we rolled out our vision for what we call The Machine, a new computing platform for the Big Data era. The Machine has become a rallying cry across HP and frankly, around the industry for the reinvention of how we compute. Martin Fink has focused his HP Lab researchers on memristors, photonics and a new operating system at the heart of this "once in a generation" project. I believe we're clearly demonstrating what I said many times before, that innovation is alive and well at HP. Over the next several months, you can expect to see the introduction of game-changing products in personal systems, servers, cloud and printing that are going to bring some real excitement to these markets. Before I turn to business group performance, I want to take a moment to once again acknowledge the contributions of Ralph Whitworth. As all of you know, Ralph stepped down last month as Chairman of HP's Board of Directors. I would like to personally thank Ralph for his tireless efforts to help drive HP's turnaround and for being a wonderful friend and adviser to me during the past 3 years. Everyone at HP is thinking about Ralph, and we all wish him the very best. HP's Board of Directors decided to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO, and I'm honored that they've asked me to assume this responsibility. I believe this will help us lead more effectively through the turnaround. Let me reassure everyone that the board and I remain fervently committed to the strong practices and financial disciplines we've put in place during the past 3 years. The best interest of our investors are always top of mind with me and the HP board. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q3 were driven by good performance in Personal Systems, growth in Industry Standard Servers and Networking, as well as disciplined cost management across all of our businesses. In Personal Systems, we had an excellent performance with revenue up 12% from the prior year period. This represents the third successive quarter of revenue growth for Personal Systems in a market that has stabilized but nevertheless continues to contract. We gained market share both year-over-year and sequentially, and we're seeing growth across all major categories. The Windows XP expiration has contributed to our growth, although we believe we're now through much of that benefit. However, our product lineup, driven by products like our EliteBook series and our x360 convertible notebook is the strongest we've had in years, and we continue to see customers looking to refresh their aging installed base. We believe we can continue to gain share in PCs despite the challenges in this market as it consolidates. The Personal Systems team continues to do a great job managing profitability with third quarter operating profit margins of 4%, up 0.9 points from the prior year period. In our Printing business, we continue to build on sustained strong margin performance with an operating profit margin of 18.4%, up 2.6 points from the prior year period. Revenue is down 4% year-over-year driven by supplies where declines in toner continue, and ink was weaker than expected. We are honing our approach here and refocusing our go-to-market, which gives me confidence that we will improve our performance over the next several quarters. Total hardware unit shipments declined 5% in the quarter. However, we gained share in both ink and multi-function printers, important categories where we now lead the market. As planned, our disciplined unit placement strategy resulted in declines in single-function mono and low-value home printers. But we're seeing continued momentum in focus areas like Managed Print Services where we had another strong quarter of signings. This is an important business for us as it supports a strong after-market sales opportunity for supplies. In the Enterprise Group, revenue grew 2% on strength in Industry Standard Servers and Networking, offset by declines in Business Critical Systems, Technology Services and Storage. In Industry Standard Servers, we saw 9% growth from the prior year period, which represents our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, and we expect to take almost 1 point of share in the second calendar quarter. We're seeing good early traction with service providers as a result of our partnership with Foxconn to produce a line of cloud optimized servers. And we moved aggressively to take advantage of the uncertainty customers feel about the IBM-Lenovo transaction. In head-to-head fights with IBM for deals, we're seeing clear improvement in win rates, all this while delivering stable gross margins. In Business Critical Systems, revenues declined 18%, broadly in line with the market and our expectations. Storage revenue declined 4% year-over-year. However, Converged Storage was up 9% while traditional storage declined 14%. 3PAR returned to double-digit growth, and we continued to gain share in the midrange. As the market shifts increasingly from high end to midrange, it's pressuring overall market growth, but I believe this plays into a sweet spot for HP, which bodes well for us in the long term. Networking performed well under the new leadership of Antonio Neri, although there remains opportunity for further improvement. Revenue grew 4% from the prior year period, and we saw good growth in switching, where we once again outperformed Cisco. We also have made significant progress on our OpenNFV program. We currently have 15 proof-of-concept projects with carriers around the world, 5 R&D labs to provide validation of our integrated solutions and strong partnerships with Alcatel-Lucent, NEC and Nokia. In Technology Services, revenue was down 3% from the prior year period. Despite the revenue headwinds in this business from weak hardware volumes in prior periods, we've maintained consistent, stable operating profit margins throughout the year, and we're seeing continued adoption of our new services like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care. We saw positive order growth in Q3, the best performance in 9 quarters. In our cloud product offerings, we are making progress with HP Helion. Since launching in May, we're seeing strong engagement from customers, and we're extending our share leadership in private cloud. In Q3, HP CloudSystem had another strong quarter with double-digit revenue growth. And I'm particularly excited about the significant milestones in cloud we have on the horizon. By the end of October, we expect to deliver commercial versions of HP Helion OpenStack and the HP Helion Development Platform, which will help enterprise customers build and deploy OpenStack-based clouds.  We will also introduce expanded Professional Services that leverage HP's unmatched OpenStack experience to accelerate customers' cloud implementations. In fact, HP is the leading code contributor to the next release of OpenStack, also scheduled for October. In June, we announced the HP Helion Network with the support of AT&T, British Telecom, Intel, Synapsis and Hong Kong Telecom. Together, we are focused on delivering a global public cloud platform that is 100% enterprise focused and open standards based. In the coming months, we expect to launch an HP Helion Network program with an even broader set of partners committed to building the world's largest cloud network. To that end, HP has reached an agreement with China's leading content distribution network service provider to build and operate community clouds for enterprise customers in China using HP Helion OpenStack. This will enable HP to meet customers' fast-growing demand for cloud services in one of the world's fastest-growing cloud markets. In Enterprise Services, revenue was down 6% from the prior year period. As expected, key account revenue runoff negatively impacted year-over-year revenue comparisons. Gross margins expanded as a result of continued labor savings, an improvement in underperforming accounts, helping ES achieve an operating profit margin of 4.1%, up 0.9 points from the prior year period and up 1.6 points sequentially. On the sales side, the Enterprise Services team is making progress on aligning their sales engines, and we once again saw bookings growth in new logos. Enterprise Services continues to be a work in progress. While the results do not yet reflect all our efforts to strengthen this business, the work of the team, as well as the feedback I'm hearing from customers tells me we're on track. In Software, Robert Youngjohns has hit the ground running in his new role. Robert and his team are making progress on evolving the software strategy and addressing the go-to-market model. They have a lot of work to do to simplify our portfolio of offerings, streamline our go-to-market and accelerate our web selling capability. In the quarter, revenue was down 5% from the prior year period driven by certain go-to-market challenges. These issues impacted revenue in our core focus areas of security and Big Data. Autonomy and Vertica revenue declined over the prior year period, and security revenue grew only slightly. On profitability, Software executed well, improving its operating profit by more than 1 percentage point on declining revenue as gross margins improved, coupled with disciplined expense management. SaaS bookings in the IT management business continue to be strong with double-digit growth over the prior year and exciting new products introduced to the market. We are shifting more of our focus on both the portfolio and the operating model to SaaS and subscription-based offerings, which may create near-term revenue headwinds while setting up the business for the long-term success. During the quarter, the Software team announced a strategic partnership with Hortonworks. The joint commitment will help accelerate the adoption of Enterprise Apache Hadoop by deeply integrating the Hortonworks Data Platform with HAVEn. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. When I look at the way the business is performing, the pipeline of innovation and the daily feedback that I receive from our customers and partners, my confidence in the turnaround grows stronger. HP is quicker to recognize opportunities in our markets and responds to challenges faster and with greater discipline than at any time in recent memory. When challenges appear in any of our businesses, we have a much better sense of what's happening, and surprises are fewer and farther between. The adversity of the turnaround is forging a much stronger company, a company focused on results and determined to drive strategy and decisions aligned with a rapidly changing industry. This sense of purpose is motivating our employees to new levels of excellence and a profound commitment to our customers and partners. Against that backdrop, our outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the full year will be $3.70 to $3.74. Now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, we're pleased with third quarter results. Performance was driven by very strong revenue growth in Personal Systems, as well as growth in Industry Standard Servers and Networking. Performance in Printing, Enterprise Services and Software was mixed with good profitability but weaker-than-expected top line results. Total revenue for the quarter was $27.6 billion, up 1% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. By region, Americas revenue was $12.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. The U.S. was approximately flat on the back of double-digit growth in Personal Systems. Brazil was up moderately, while other countries in the region declined. EMEA revenue was $10 billion, up 5% year-over-year or up 1% in constant currency driven by some recovery in mature western economies, partially offset primarily by significant weakness in Russia. APJ revenue was $5.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year or up 4% in constant currency. We experienced solid growth in China led by a double-digit increase in the Enterprise Group, partially offset by weakness in Japan and India. Gross margin for the quarter was 24%, up 0.6 points year-over-year and down 0.2 points sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by rate improvement across most of the portfolio, partially offset by the strong revenue performance in Industry Standard Servers and Personal Systems. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 5% year-over-year. The increase in OpEx was primarily driven by increased investments in R&D, as well as real estate gains in the year-ago period. Sequentially, OpEx was approximately flat and in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2.3 billion or 8.5% of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and flat sequentially. We recorded $145 million of expense on the other income and expense line. With a 22.5% tax rate and a weighted average diluted share count of 1.9 billion shares, we delivered third quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.89, at the high end of our outlook range. Third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.52 was below our forecasted range due to a higher than originally estimated restructuring charge of $649 million. However, we expect the total FY '14 charge for the incremental restructuring activities to be in line with our prior expectations. GAAP earnings also included $227 million of expense for the amortization of intangible assets. Turning to the business units. Personal Systems had an excellent quarter across all businesses with revenue up 12% year-over-year to $8.6 billion, gaining share across the board. Commercial sales grew 14% year-over-year with consumer sales up 8% and strength broadly across all of the regions outside of pockets of weakness in Russia and China. Total unit shipments grew approximately 13% year-over-year with growth in both consumer and commercial, and channel inventory remains within acceptable ranges. Even in a competitive pricing environment, Personal Systems achieved solid operating profits of $346 million or 4% of revenue, up 0.9 points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by volume and some improved pricing, as well as operational cost reductions as the team continues to segment and target the right market opportunities, as well as streamline and refine supply chain management across the business. Printing revenue performance was weak, but profitability remains strong. And as Meg said, the team is in the process of making key adjustments to the go-to-market approach. Revenue was $5.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year, as declines in both hardware and supplies were partially offset by continued traction in graphics and Managed Print Services.  Commercial hardware revenue was $1.4 billion, flat year-over-year and consumer hardware revenue was $529 million, down 6%. Total hardware unit shipments declined 5% year-over-year as we continue to focus on selectively placing high-value units. We continue to see success with our new print business models. In Q2, we ran a series of promotions to move older Ink in the Office products through the channel ahead of our upcoming product transition. As a result, older product sales declined in Q3 and drove overall Ink in the Office sales lower year-over-year. However, we saw a double-digit year-over-year growth in our new OfficeJet Pro X and OfficeJet Pro X Enterprise products, and we expect the program overall to grow in fiscal '14. Our Ink Advantage program also saw continued traction, and we once again grew unit shipments and revenue by double digits year-over-year. Supplies revenue was $3.7 billion, down 5% over the prior year and made up 65.5% of Printing revenue. Both ink and toner were down. Part of the decline was driven by stronger channel buy-in during Q3 last year ahead of pricing actions we took on ink, making for a tough year-over-year compare. We also experienced a larger-than-expected inventory correction from the consolidation of U.S. retailers, which may suggest some softness in demand, but it's too early to confirm this is a trend. Supplies channel inventory levels declined on a year-over-year basis, but have increased sequentially and above our target range. We expect to bring inventory levels back within the range in the fourth quarter and anticipate this will pressure our fourth quarter supplies revenue. Total Printing operating profit was a strong $1 billion or 18.4% of revenue, up 2.6 points year-over-year due primarily to favorable currency. The Enterprise Group had a solid quarter. Total revenue was $6.9 billion, up 2% year-over-year with growth in Industry Standard Servers, Networking and Converged Storage, partially offset by declines in traditional storage, Technology Services and Business Critical Systems. Operating profit was $966 million or 14% of revenue, down 1.1 point year-over-year. Good discount discipline in the quarter was more than offset by higher cost of sales and the mix impact of strong Industry Standard Server revenue growth, as well as strategic R&D and sales investments. By business, Industry Standard Server revenue was $3.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year with improvement in all regions. We also experienced higher average unit prices in ISS as a result of stronger option attach. Technology Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The team continues to execute well in this business, and we saw a return to positive order growth, and our penetration rate is up over the prior year in BCS, Storage and Networking. Total storage performance was a bit disappointing with revenue of $796 million, down 4% year-over-year driven by a 14% decline in traditional storage. However, Converged Storage sales grew 9% this quarter led by double-digit growth in 3PAR as customers continue to adopt alternatives to traditional high-end enterprise storage arrays. While 3PAR plus XP plus EVA revenue declined 7% year-over-year, we expect another quarter of share gain in the external disc market overall in calendar Q2 '14. Networking performed well in the quarter. Revenue was $672 million, up 4% year-over-year driven primarily by strength in switching across all regions. Top line growth is expected to result in share gain in calendar Q2 '14. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 18% over the prior year period, broadly in line with the market to $233 million. High-performance computing is core to who we are at HP, and while we continue to manage the decline in units, we are also committed to delivering new solutions to meet our customers' mission-critical needs and are excited about the products roadmap. Enterprise Services revenue was $5.6 billion, down 6% year-over-year driven by continued key account runoff, as well as incremental weakness in EMEA. By business, IT outsourcing revenue was $3.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year, and Applications and Business Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 4%. Operating profit for ES was $228 million or 4.1% of revenue, up 0.9 points year-over-year. The increase was driven by continued cost actions and improvements in underperforming accounts. Looking forward, we expect meaningful incremental benefit in the fourth quarter from the workforce restructuring implemented during the third quarter, as well as a continued improvements in underperforming accounts. Turning to sales metrics. Small- and medium-sized deals grew, and we continued to see strong double-digit bookings growth in strategic Enterprise Services or the services for the new style of IT, although lower renewals drove overall findings down. Turning to Software. While Software revenue declined, the team continued to drive solid profitability through gross margin expansion, as well as disciplined expense management. As Meg talked about, the Software team is focused on evolving the business strategy and go-to-market approach to better leverage the great products we have in the portfolio. Weakness in license revenue offset continued growth in our software-as-a-service offerings, driving total Software revenue of $959 million, down 5% year-over-year. Operating profit remains solid at $203 million or 21.2% of revenue, up 1.1 points year-over-year. License revenue declined 16% year-over-year with weakness across the portfolio. Support revenue was flat over the prior year with growth in security offset by weakness in the rest of the portfolio from past license revenue declines. Professional Services revenue declined 3% year-over-year with softer IT management revenue, partially offset by growth in security. Our continued focus on profitability in this business impacted our top line performance in the quarter. SaaS revenue grew 8% year-over-year, and we continued to see strong bookings growth in IT management. We launched exciting new products in the quarter, including the June release of Service Anywhere, which we believe positions us very well against the competition and is getting good early customer traction. HP Financial Services revenue was $855 million, down 3% year-over-year. Operating profit was $79 million or 9.2% of revenue. HP FS revenue and operating profit were impacted both on a year-over-year and on a sequential basis by a customer billing adjustment but were otherwise in line with expectations. New financing volume grew 14% and return on equity was 14.7%, down 2.6 points year-over-year, entirely due to the billing adjustment. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We had another strong quarter with $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and $2.7 billion in free cash flow. Our cash conversion cycle was 8 days in the quarter with year-over-year improvement of 1 day in both days of inventory and days sales outstanding and an 8-day improvement in days payable outstanding. Favorable payment terms with suppliers, strength in Personal Systems and the factoring program mentioned last quarter supported the cash conversion cycle improvement. Although we do not typically update our outlook every quarter, I did want to lay out how we think cash flow will end the fiscal year. Our free cash flow is already $7.4 billion year-to-date, and I expect that we will exit this year at approximately $9 billion for the full year. Cash flow remains a priority for us, and we continue to execute well. We repurchased 17.5 million shares in the quarter and paid $299 million in dividends. In total, we returned approximately $881 million to shareholders in Q3. During the quarter, we were limited in our ability to purchase shares due to material nonpublic information. We intend to resume the share repurchase program during Q4 and remain committed to returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2014. Our restructuring program is on track, and approximately 36,000 people have exited the company under the program through the end of the third quarter. We expect approximately 41,000 to exit by the end of the fiscal year and a total reduction of 45,000 to 50,000 under this program with the remainder exiting in fiscal 2015. Looking forward to Q4. In Personal Systems, while the Uttar Pradesh deal last year will make for a tough compare, we still expect to gain share in the market on the back of a strong product lineup and go-to-market approach. In Printing, we expect supplies to remain under pressure in the fourth quarter, as we bring channel inventory levels back within our target range, but we expect to see continued momentum in our innovative new programs across the portfolio. In the Enterprise Group, overall, we expect the hardware market to remain highly competitive. However, in storage, we anticipate that the market will continue to shift from the high to the midrange where we are well positioned. And in ISS, while the Bing deal from last year will create a tough compare, the team is executing well. In the Enterprise Services, given the incremental weakness we saw in Q3 from EMEA, we're updating our full year revenue outlook. We now expect full year revenue to decline 6% to 7% over the prior year. However, given our good progress on cost management and execution, we continue to believe that we can achieve a full year operating margin within the previously provided range of 3.5% to 4.5%. From a macroeconomic perspective, we expect geopolitical uncertainty to continue, impacting specific territories such as Russia, as well as increased competitive pressures likely in China.  With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.74. From a GAAP perspective, we expect full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.79. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: This is another great quarter of cash flow, but we're not seeing the EPS upside that I think people are hoping for given higher revenue and more restructuring savings. What levers do you have to show more operating leverage going forward? Or is it as simple as meeting a revenue recovery that's not just PC driven?
Catherine Lesjak: So Katy, over the longer term, and when I think of that, I think about fiscal '15, I think one of the real upsides for us that is not revenue directly related and that's really in our Enterprise Services group. The fact is that we have made really good progress this year, and I believe that Q3 is a great proof point at delivering operating profit of 4.1%. The fact that we reconfirm that we're going to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% for '14 is also setting us up really well for '15. We are taking the -- we're making the investments that we need to make to get the cost out of that business. We are improving our underperforming contracts very materially, and that's going to set us up very well for '15 to improve EPS without strong revenue performance.
Margaret Whitman: And Katy, this is Meg. I would just add one thing, is that we have taken out cost apace with a pretty significant revenue decline in '12, '13, and up until this quarter, we still had declining revenues. And now if revenue stabilizes, we have more cost to take out. There's operational improvement opportunities across the board. If we can stabilize revenue, then I think you'll start to see the EPS uptick that you're looking for.
Operator: Next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Meg, you just mentioned that if revenues stabilize, you could really start to see some impact and benefit on EPS. I was wondering if you could just try and address that a bit more broadly. I mean, this quarter was clearly a lot of disparate revenue growth of the company. If PCs grew at 12% and the rest of the company grew at minus 3%, so I'm wondering if you can comment around -- I know you don't like commenting specifically about revenue growth, but particularly around PCs, how do you envision market growth over the next year or 2? And secondly, if we think more broadly about revenue growth given that 12% may not be sustainable and given that comparisons are a lot tougher, which you noted several times in your prepared remarks, is it really realistic to think that revenue growth can remain stable over the next year or 2?
Margaret Whitman: So let me address PCs first. The PC market -- and when I say PC, I mean right up through tablets, not including, obviously, smartphones. The PC business is flat to declining slightly, and we think that, that will continue. However, what we do believe is we can continue to gain share in a relatively flat market, and that's because we've got a terrific product lineup. We've got a great go-to-market. Our relationships with partners is better than it has ever been. So while the XP refresh is largely done, we're seeing good growth and continued growth in the commercial side. And by the way, our consumer business grew 8%, which we haven't seen that in many, many years. So I feel like the PC business has some wind beneath its wings, and I think for the foreseeable future, we'll be in a pretty good shape there. Overall revenue growth for the company, we still have a portfolio that has some declining businesses, some flat businesses and some growing businesses. And as those growing businesses get stronger and the declining businesses, like Business Critical Systems, I mean, that eventually will be a 0 there on the UNIX business, and therefore, you'll start to see accelerating growth. So it's a portfolio management issue. And again, servers grew this year for the first time. 3PAR returned to double-digit growth. Networking had pretty good growth. Graphics, which we don't talk a bit -- a lot about is now a meaningful growing business, Managed Print Services, security, strategic Enterprise Services. So we've got real pockets of growth, and we've just got to balance out that portfolio to bring ongoing stabilized revenue.
Operator: Next question from Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I just had a couple. I wonder -- Meg, can you talk a little bit about PC strength regionally? In other words, where was it strong? Where is it weaker? I know you guys called out Russia and China as weak points from a macro perspective, but I'm just wondering if there are -- what you're seeing in the emerging markets, for instance, where Cisco called out some weakness, and just if you can give us a little bit more regional color there will be helpful. And then I also wonder, do you guys ever -- are you ever able to quantify the impact of the XP expiration, particularly in fiscal Q3? Was it a material impact in fiscal Q3 that we should see rolling off in fiscal Q4? Can you just help us understand how that progresses over the next few quarters?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. With regard to PC strength regionally, this was broad based across all regions. Americas and EMEA, in particular, had good quarters. China was a little weaker for us in PCs. Russia was tough for us across the board. But what I will say is China for HP as a whole was actually a pretty good performance. Servers did very well. Our Printing business did very well there. Our Software business did quite well there. So China was only a weak spot in the PC area. Cathie, do you want to talk about quantifying the XP impact? It's a little difficult to do. I would say, the XP impact was even more in Q2 than it was in Q3. A country like Japan, which is a very significant Microsoft market, they went fast to XP, but maybe you can give a little more color.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So it is very difficult to quantify the impact of XP because you also have the impact from the older, aging installed base, and the fact of the matter is that people realize that there are certain things they need to do, they need to do on notebooks or laptops -- I'd say laptops or desktops, and so they really need a PC. And so it's really difficult for us to quantify what's going on there. To Meg's point though about Japan, if you look at kind of the local currency growth year-over-year last quarter, it was in the mid-single digits. Even this quarter, it's up in the high-single digits, but it has obviously moved very quickly from XP to Windows. Let me also just give a little bit more color on the regional. So if you look at PCs in Americas, up in local currency double digits, that was led by very strong performance in the U.S., again, double-digit performance. EMEA had double-digit performance growth as well, and that was heavily led by the U.K. with double digits; Germany, double digits; and to a lesser extent, Italy. And then APJ was up high-single digits. So we really had broad-based performance -- strong performance in PCs.
Margaret Whitman: And even in China, commercial PCs did well.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes.
Margaret Whitman: Consumer, not so much but commercial, pretty good.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes.
Operator: From Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: A question for Meg and then one for Cathie. Meg, when you look at your services that declined, I think, it's a little bit concerning year-over-year and eventually [ph] EMEA [indiscernible]. Is it solely attributable to EMEA that the [indiscernible] new incremental items causing you to be more cautious? And then for Cathie, if you can just talk about cash flow, I mean, Meg talked about more of a stable revenue [indiscernible] what we're hoping for. So if that happens, your cash flow has been about $9 billion the last 2 years in a row. Should we expect some changes to that, as I had assumed inventory work down has helped to offset [indiscernible] cash flow? Or how should we think about the cash flow in a more stable environment versus the past few years of revenue decline?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Let me first address your question, though, on the EMEA weakness and the Enterprise Services. That was really pressured by probably 3 things. The first is that we did see weakness in public sector spending in the Enterprise Services group within EMEA, mostly in Western Europe. We saw some general runoff in the region, and then we were also impacted by the geopolitical instability in Eastern Europe. And so those were the big impacts in Q3, and we actually believe that we're going to continue to see those pressures in the near term. Turning to cash flow, what we've talked a lot about is that our free cash flow is highly correlated over time to our non-GAAP net earnings, and we continue to believe that's the case once we get to a more stable spot with the cash conversion cycle, and so that's how you should think about our free cash flow going forward.
Margaret Whitman: And I will say, the organization deserves a lot of credit for this cash flow performance because, remember, this is about inventory. This is about SKU and platform management, payables, receivables and making sure we have the least amount of inventory and yet, satisfy our customer demands. And it's been a really significant improvement since the fall of 2011. So we're getting really pretty good at this.
Catherine Lesjak: We are.
Margaret Whitman: So I wouldn't say you're going to see a decrease beyond 8 days on the cash conversion cycle. In fact, if PCs slow down a little bit, the cash conversion cycle is going to go up because, as you recall, we have a negative cash conversion cycle on our PC business.
Catherine Lesjak: So to quantify that, the PC, the strength in the PC business relative to the rest of the portfolio and then also the fact that the ES business was weaker, we basically had a cash conversion cycle for PCs, which is in -- quite negative, which is good. And that is -- and we had higher mix of that, and then we had a lower mix of the Enterprise Services, which has a higher cash conversion cycle. Those need to normalize over time. So as you think about the future, think about -- we don't believe that PCs continue to outgrow the rest of the portfolio, and that'll put upward pressure on the cash conversion cycle.
Operator: Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: I wanted to ask you about cash priorities with the cash flow at $9 billion plus for the second straight year. What are you leaning more towards in the upcoming quarters, buybacks, dividends or acquisitions, Meg? And obviously, during the quarter, you had a material nonpublic event, and so you were, obviously, contemplating a potential material nonpublic event, and you were contemplating, obviously, it was probably a major acquisition. So how are we supposed to just reconcile the cash priorities with such great cash flow? What are you going to do in the future? And how should we reconcile that comment as well?
Margaret Whitman: Sure. So our capital allocation strategy remains the same, and we have said that we will return at least half our cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchase. And despite the fact we were not buying shares in the third quarter, we intend to return to buying shares, and we believe we will meet that commitment by the time we get to the end of '14. So the first thing is to just reiterate our capital allocation strategy. With regard to M&A, now that we have repaired the balance sheet, as I have said before, I do think M&A will be a part of our strategy. But let me assure you that this will be returns based. It will be focused on only things that we cannot do organically. And given the choice, I would rather invest organically. This is the heritage of Hewlett-Packard. We do core R&D better than anyone else. So I think M&A will be a part of our future, but I want to reassure you on capital allocation strategy and also the returns-based approach we're taking. And Cathie, I don't know if you want to comment between dividends and share repurchase.
Catherine Lesjak: I think the only thing I would say there and we've said this a few times, is that at the current stock valuation, we think that our shares are very attractive, and therefore, our bias in the mix is to buying back shares.
Operator: From Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: I had a question just on the server side. And I'm wondering how big the opportunity is for HP as we look forward on the Windows Server 2003 expiration. I think some people have sized or upsized it somewhere in that 10 million to 14 million units of servers that are out there that need to be upgraded, which I think is fairly significant. But how do we think about -- or I guess, how does HP think about that? And then relative to that, what do you expect from a competitive level dynamic to be? Would you expect that people will get more aggressive in pricing? Will we see more pricing pressure as people drive after that opportunity?
Margaret Whitman: So we agree with you. We think that the Windows Server 2003 upgrade is an opportunity for us. There's a significant number of servers in the installed base, and they are going to have to upgrade. So there is some similarity between the XP upgrade and the Server upgrade, but -- and so we are following the same program from a marketing perspective. So we are organizing ourselves to go after this. It will be a competitive market, but I think we've got a really good -- we've been thoughtful about this, and I think we've got a really good shot to gain more than our fair share of that refresh.
Catherine Lesjak: Let me also add that we recently announced a new program with Microsoft to actually capture some of this end-of-life opportunity that really is around channel-optimized IT solutions, the services, the training and the financing, as well as the support to help our partners actually drive the growth and capture the opportunity.
Operator: Next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I had a question on your Printing business. You talked about making adjustments in go-to-market. Can you talk a little bit more about what the issues are, how you're thinking about what's going on within the channel and usage and that? And then based on your models, when do you think supplies might grow again? I mean, I think InkJet is doing pretty well, but clearly, laser is under pressure.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me step back and give you the perspective on our Printing business. This is one of the great HP businesses, and let me just break it down for you in terms of where we are on laser and ink. Laser is a business where we're recovering from a weaker installed base that goes back a number of years. And the planned decline in hardware was very deliberate. We are focusing on high-value profitable units that have an annuity that -- of toner that makes sense for us. So we think the laser business, toner, we're seeing some signs of recovery in other areas, particularly in Europe, as we rehabilitate, if you will, and upgrade the user base. For example, we're the leader now in MFPs, which is quite remarkable since we really weren't a player in that business 3 years ago. Ink, you heard Cathie say in her remarks that ink, what we saw was some consolidation at retail, some channel loading up last year in advance of the price increase, but the real opportunity in ink is Ink in the Office, to basically take ink up into the small- to medium-sized enterprise in a more profitable way, in a way that is twice the speed, half the cost per page and more profitable for us. So we think ink will recover over time. We're bullish on that, but we are going to have to correct ink channel inventory as we go into Q4. But what's exciting about ink is we have -- or exciting about Printing is we've got innovative business models. We've got some incredibly innovative products. And the go-to-market change was simply just dial up our specialists. So when we put Printing and Personal Systems together, which, by the way, I think was absolutely the right thing to do. We've gotten tremendous channel leverage from then just go-to-market leverage, we probably overcorrected to more generalists on account management and partner management, and so we're adding back print specialists in the go-to-market.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me address -- I think you followed up on that with, and when do you expect supplies revenue?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, good.
Catherine Lesjak: And so we expect supplies revenue to stabilize in fiscal '15. We've got a number of strategic initiatives, most of which you know about, that will take -- that are relatively early in their maturity stage, and they will take some time to show up. But that's where we start to see it in fiscal '15. We did see some softness in demand this quarter, and we are actively managing that to see whether or not this is going to be a trend. And then the other data point that I think is important is when you think about supplies mix over the longer term is that it's probably in the mid-60s type range.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. And the only thing I'd add is the other thing we're excited about is Managed Print Services. And as I said on the call, Managed Print Services, first of all, it's a growth part of the market. We had terrific bookings, and we get 100% of the aftermarket on that business. So listen, we feel -- notwithstanding the results this quarter, we feel really good about the Printing business. We got some things we need to improve execution on a number of dimensions, but we feel really pretty good about this business.
Catherine Lesjak: And if I could throw in one more data point on the TCV and Managed Print Services, up strong double digits year-over-year, so we're making really good progress on the signings in that space.
Operator: Next question is from Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Along the same lines, I wondered if you could address the go-to-market challenges in Software, specifically what that means. And then also, there are some signs that Europe might be taking a step back economically, and you guys are a bit overweight in Europe. Are you concerned about that looking forward?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, with regard to go-to-market in Software, we've got a very broad Software portfolio. We've got Big Data, security and our IT performance management suite across 3 major regions in many, many countries. And again, we're doing the adjustment, the specialists to generalists, which of these businesses need their own sales force, which can use leverage of the global software sales force and frankly, which can use the global HP sales force. So Robert Youngjohns is looking very carefully at market segmentation, the alignment of the sales coverage resources and the opportunity for better attach with the rest of the HP portfolio, so for example, tipping point with Networking. So we've got some work to do on our go-to-market. And we're basically doing the same thing. We've done a lot of work on go-to-market in EG. Mike Nefkens has done a lot of work on go-to-market on our Enterprise Services, and we're running that same play now in Software. The challenge in Software is there is a fundamental market dislocation here, which is traditional license is moving to SaaS. And as that happens, it will create a stronger, I think, longer-term revenue stream as an annuity, but it will create some dislocation in the near term as that market shift gets underway or continues to be underway.
Catherine Lesjak: And to address your question on EMEA, that's -- we're not really seeing that in EMEA. So our results from an EMEA perspective, if you look at the top 3 countries in the EMEA region, basically, Germany, UK&I and France, they're growing mid- to high-single digits; and in the case of one of them, double digits. Where we are seeing softness in EMEA is in Russia.
Margaret Whitman: Yes.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Could you comment on how gross margins are trending in the Industry Standard Servers segment, particularly as the mix continues to shift towards hyperscale? And perhaps, provide some more detail on how your cost structure is evolving with the changing market dynamics. Obviously, you've regained plenty of momentum on the market share side, but I just wanted to dig a bit more into the margin structure, how you're thinking about that as well.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. We actually had a good quarter in Industry Standard Servers, not just from top line perspective but also from a profitability perspective. And what you see is our AUPs, our average unit prices, grew significantly double digits year-over-year, high-single digits quarter-on-quarter, really on the strength of our very strong option attach. We are also doing a really good job of segmenting the market and figuring out where growth is and good profitable growth. And so that's really helping with margins. We also saw much improved discipline around discounting, and we're driving very strong savings in supply chain. So all of that is really contributing despite the competitive pricing environment contributing to improving margins in Industry Standard Server.
Operator: Next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Just had a question on the free cash flow guidance for the full year for fiscal '14. Cathie, if my math's right, it sounded like you had about $1.6 billion of free cash flow in Q4. I'm curious with the uptick in net income that you're expecting in Q4, why do you expect the degradation of almost $1 billion in free cash flow in Q4?
Catherine Lesjak: So we don't typically update our free cash flow. We went out on a limb again this quarter to do that because we are making such progress. And the progress in the free cash flow is really on the strength of the working capital improvement that you saw. We saw the cash conversion cycle at 8 days basically improve to 10 days year-over-year, improvement across all the metrics, but obviously the strongest and better than expected was in the DPO space where we had an 8-day improvement. We continue to stay focused on free cash flow and drive that hard. And we'll see how we end the year.
Operator: Is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: You guys had very strong results in terms of operating margins for the PC business this quarter. I just wanted to get a sense of how sustainable these margins are in the Personal Systems segment. And what types of margins do you expect in this segment going forward?
Catherine Lesjak: So let's talk a little bit about what drove the improvement in margins in PCs, and then we can talk about sustainability because you can get a read through a bit. So the profitability improvements were driven by, obviously, the volume, the strength in the top line but also, operational cost reductions around warranty, logistics. We also got a bit of a mix benefit in the material cost space. Obviously, we're continuing to see a very competitive pricing environment. At its core is that we are doing a great job of segmenting the market and figuring out where the market opportunities are, where you can grow and grow profitably. Make no mistake. We're still very focused on profitable growth. We saw some of that improvement in consumer. Consumer was up 8% year-over-year on the top line, and we also saw improving profitability. So that maniacal focus on making sure that we've got a very efficient, lean organization, as well as the segmentation on where the market opportunities are, I think, are sustainable.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, I agree with that. I would also say that our product lineup continues to be very strong. And in the end, you have to lead with great product, whether it's for the commercial space or the consumer space. So I feel good about the work we've done around supply chain and all the work that Dion and his team has done but perhaps, most importantly is the strength of the product lineup.
Operator: Is from Keith Bachman of Bank of MontrÃ©al.
Keith Bachman: I wanted to go back to Services if I could. In the past, HP said that the book-to-bill would be about 1 this year. I know you took revenue guidance down. Is it still possible for the book-to-bill to be 1? And if it is, let's say it's about 1, so signings -- would it suggest that signings will be down 6% to 7%. Can you grow revenues in FY '15 with signings down so much? And can you grow pretax income -- or excuse me, operating income dollars in Services with signings down so much?
Catherine Lesjak: So as I talked about, I think, at the very beginning of this call, I do think the opportunity to improve the EPS at the HP level is without revenue growth, is, in fact, in the Enterprise Services space where we have a lot more cost that still needs to come out of that organization. So I do think that you can get the EPS improvement that we were talking about. In terms of the book-to-bill, we'll talk a lot more about this at our security analyst meeting, but we do expect to end the year with a book-to-bill of approximately 1 in that business.
Operator: From Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: I want to go back to the free cash flow story a little bit. When we started the year, you guys talked about 20 to 22 days of cash conversion cycle. Now we're at 8. I'd just like to understand, on a normal basis, how you're thinking about that. And then on top of that, can you just quantify the impact of factoring and what that had this quarter and whether you anticipate that to continue going forward?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure, let's start with that. The factoring impact in the quarter over a year-over-year basis was roughly the same as last quarter, 1 to 2 days. Sequentially, there wasn't a material impact from factoring in our DSO or in the cash conversion cycle. In terms of kind of what is the sustainable level of the cash conversion cycle, we definitely believe that we're below our sustainable rate at 8 days. We certainly got a big benefit from the mix, the revenue mix on PSG. That was approximately 2 to 3 days. And so as you look at it long term, that mix is going to come back down. We do not expect that the PC business or the Personal Systems business will outgrow the rest of the company over the long term. And then also, just keep in mind that cash flow can swing quarter-to-quarter in -- for DSO and DPO based on the linearity of the business in the quarter. And we'll talk a lot more about our working capital and our forecast for '15 at our security analyst meeting.
Margaret Whitman: Great. Well, thank you all for joining us today. I think Cathie and I and the rest of the senior management team continue to be very encouraged by the progress of the turnaround that we are making. You can see it, every day we're out with customers, and the partners and the customers can see an enormous difference in our team members, in our product, in our innovation and our will to win. And I'm pleased because the organization is much quicker to recognize the opportunities and much quicker to jump on the challenges that inevitably will come our way in a market that's changing as fast as this. So thanks very much. Progress, more work to do.
Rob Binns: Great. Thank you. Thanks, everyone, and with that, we'll close the call. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2014 Q2  (2014-05-22 17:00:00) =====

The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including any tax-related items, reflect estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from amounts ultimately reported in HP's second quarter Form 10-Q. Revenue, earnings, operating margin and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items including, amongst other things, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first half of fiscal 2014 closed, I'm pleased to report that HP's turnaround remains on track. As you would expect in the turnaround of this scale, there are some businesses performing better than we expected and others with more work to do. We've made significant progress in putting the systems and structures in place to more effectively manage the business, and we are focused on putting the right talent in place to lead the next leg of the turnaround. Most of all, we stabilized the top line and we're starting to see the benefits of our focus and investments in key technologies. We have more work to do to improve the consistency of our execution and lower our cost structure to drive overall profitability, but I believe we're well positioned as we enter the second half of 2014. Rest assured, sustained, profitable revenue growth remains our top priority. Innovation is at the heart of our strategy to turn HP around, and in the second quarter, you saw the launch of several critical elements of our innovation agenda. In cloud, we launched HP Helion, a portfolio products and services that enables the next phase of our enterprise customers' cloud journey. Helion is changing the game in cloud, by allowing the integration of public, private, managed cloud and traditional IT environments on an open and secure platform. We are addressing a major pain point for the enterprise customers with Helion, and the early interest has been very positive. We also announced further significant business model innovation in our server business with the creation of a joint venture with Foxconn. Together, we're creating a new line of cloud-optimized servers, specifically targeting service providers. This partnership brings together the high-volume design and manufacturing expertise of Foxconn, with the compute services brand and go-to-market leadership of HP. Together, we will redefine the infrastructure economics of the world's largest service providers. In Big Data, we unveiled the HP Shark system for SAP HANA. This new converged system is designed to deliver higher levels of performance and availability for in-memory computing, at up to twice the speed of other solutions. We saw strong sequential growth in our HANA offerings in the second quarter, and we introduced OpenNFV, a comprehensive network function virtualization program. This new program is designed to help telecom customers launch new services faster, with less expense and lower risk. NFV is one of the most significant shifts the telecommunications industry has experienced in the last 20 years and represents an important opportunity for HP. As I have said before, we continue to see an acceleration of the massive shift that are transforming the way customers buy, pay for and consume technology. This reality is creating both opportunities and challenges for HP and every one of our competitors. To win, we have to continue to focus and make HP a more nimble, lower-cost and more customer- and partner-centric company. We've made a lot of progress to that end over the past 2 years, but we still have more work to do in our structure, our systems and our go to market. In the second half of 2014, we will be accelerating these activities to ensure that we have the right structure in place as we enter 2015. As a result, we now expect up to an additional 16,000 employees will leave the company under the previously announced 2012 restructuring program. This will bring the total number of employees leaving under the program to as many as 50,000. No company likes to reduce their workforce, but the reality is that HP must be maniacally focused on continuous improvement in our cost structure. We believe this further alignment, along with the expected increase in investments in innovation and infrastructure, set us up as a force to be reckoned with in the rapidly shifting markets where we compete. Turning to the second quarter, HP delivered $0.88 in diluted non-GAAP net earnings per share at the high end of our previously stated financial outlook of $0.85 to $0.89 per share. For the second consecutive quarter, total revenue for the company was approximately flat in constant currency, and we once again delivered very strong cash flow, generating $3 billion in cash flow from operations. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q2 were driven by solid performance in Printing, Networking and Personal Systems, as well as disciplined cost management across all of our businesses. In Personal Systems, we had a very strong performance, with revenue up 7% over the prior year. Overall, we're seeing a slowing market contraction and signs of stabilization, particularly in commercial PCs. This is coupled with support from a refresh of an aging installed base and the expiration of Windows XP. HP executed well in the quarter, particularly in our commercial PC segment. Overall, PSG operating margins improved, and we gained share with good growth in Europe and Japan. We reclaimed the #1 position in both commercial PCs and in desktops, all against the backdrop of a declining market. Looking forward, I'm excited about the strength of our product lineup, and we will remain focused on profitable growth and continuing to drive further action on our end-to-end cost structure. For the fourth consecutive quarter, our Printing business, once again, outperformed the market and saw unit placement growth, and we held or gained share in every major printing category and region on a year-over-year basis, all while delivering another quarter of excellent profitability. In Enterprise Services, as expected, revenue was down 7% over the prior year, as delayed key account revenue runoff from FY '13 continued. The operating profit margin in the ES was flat over the prior year and up sequentially. We expect to see a continued ramp in margins in the second half, and Cathie will elaborate further on this in a moment. We remain focused on our proactive sales efforts in ES and are in the early stages of this transition, but I can feel the increased confidence from our customers. While total signings were down over the prior year, strategic Enterprise Services bookings growth is encouraging and we saw good new wins in the quarter. For example, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security awarded HP a cyber-security contract worth up to $32 million, and Belgium's Flemish government awarded a 7-year, EUR 500 million contract to HP and Belgacom to offer ICT services to all local and provincial government entities. The program will give citizens access to information and services through a virtual private cloud solution. We've made progress, but opportunities remain for improvement in services bookings and we need to move faster in ramping up our cost savings and productivity initiatives. However, I'm confident that the leadership team is taking the right steps to get Enterprise Services back on track. In the Enterprise Group, revenue declined 2% over the prior year, driven by lower Technology Services and Storage revenue, as well as the expected decline in Business Critical Systems. This was partially offset by growth in networking and Industry Standard Servers. We continue to see a very competitive market in enterprise infrastructure. I'm confident that the changes we've made in the leadership and go-to-market execution, coupled with cost saving opportunities and our investment in innovation, have put this business back on the right path. However, we expect it will take a few quarters for these changes to consistently take hold. In addition to the new products that I discussed earlier, I'm very excited about some of the innovations that we'll be rolling out in the second half of the year from our server, cloud, Storage, Technology Services and Converged Systems team. We're doubling down on innovation in EG, because we believe that it's how we're going to differentiate in this market. In Industry Standard Servers, revenue grew for the third consecutive quarter. The team continues to make progress on stabilizing this business and improving our cost structure and go-to-market. We continue to see good customer interest in Moonshot with over 100 beta customers and engagements through our discovery labs, and over 40 partners in the program. While we are seeing a ramp in Moonshot revenue, we don't anticipate this will become material in the near term. However, we believe Moonshot is on its way to becoming a disruptive product in a new category of servers. The decline in Business Critical Systems moderated in the quarter. Revenue was down 14% over the prior year and up 1% sequentially. Storage revenue was down 6% over the prior year, as consumers appear to pause to assess new products and market innovations. Despite the market, we still expect to gain 1 point of share, overall. We have work to do to improve our go-to-market in this business, particularly, our execution in the Americas. We've invested in additional storage sales specialists, but these take time to ramp to full productivity. Overall, we remain very confident in our Storage business. We believe our converged storage portfolio is well positioned to address shifting market forces with products like 3PAR, StoreVirtual and StoreOnce. Networking performed well with an acceleration of growth. Revenue grew 6% over the prior year with strength in switching and routing, and we saw growth across all of our regions. As I have said many times, in a turnaround, having the right people in the right place at the right time is critical. To that end, we recently announced that Antonio Neri has assumed management responsibility for the Networking business, in addition to his current role leading the server team. Antonio is a proven leader who has done an excellent job guiding our Server business over the past several quarters, and our Technology Services business before that. Integrated systems are becoming increasingly prominent in the data center, and Antonio's new role will help us better align our compute and networking product strategies. In Technology Services, revenue declined 5% over the prior year. The nature of this business means performance typically lags hardware sales, overall. So we expect revenue to stabilize in line with the progress we've made in our hardware sales. The leadership team in TS has done an excellent job managing this business, and we continue to see very good customer adoption of our new services, and margins remained strong. In Software, revenue was flat over the prior year. Performance in the quarter was driven by growth in Autonomy licensing and strong double-digit growth in security and Vertica, offset by softness in our traditional IT management business. Looking forward, we will continue our transition to SaaS, while rejuvenating our core portfolio and investing in operational improvements across this business. In addition, I've asked George Kadifa to take on a new role as Executive Vice President of Strategic Relationships. In this role, George will be responsible for leading growth initiatives and alliance programs with key partners, service providers and our largest customers. After leading HP Software, George has gained a unique perspective on our strategic priorities like cloud, Big Data, security and mobility. He understands both the customer requirements and the partner ecosystem that must be built to realize the potential of these technologies. Robert Youngjohns will take over for George as the Executive Vice President and General Manager of HP Software. Robert is a very seasoned technology executive with more than 3 decades of experience. He joined the company last year to lead the turnaround of HP Autonomy, after serving as President of Microsoft North America. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, but we still have a lot more work to do. Our focus continues to be driving innovation, simplifying our organizational structure to speed decision-making and reducing costs. These initiatives are particularly important as we continue to navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace. Against that backdrop, our Q3 outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share will be $0.86 to $0.90. And for the full year, the outlook will be $3.63 to $3.75. So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. As Meg said, we feel good about where we are, overall, as we reach the midpoint of the turnaround. In Q2, total company revenue was in line with expectations, with pockets of strength in PCs and Networking. Enterprise Group revenue was somewhat lower than expected, as Storage revenue fell, although Converged Storage solutions continue to outperform the market. Total revenue for the quarter was $27.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year and approximately flat in constant currency. By region, Americas revenue was $11.7 billion, down 6% year-over-year or down 4% in constant currency. In the U.S., revenue was impacted by key account runoff in Enterprise Services, plus softness in LaserJet Printing and in most EG business units. This was partially offset by strength in commercial PCs and Networking. In Brazil, we experienced weakness across all of our businesses. EMEA revenue was $10.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year, or up 2% in constant currency, driven by growth in mature Western European economies. We experienced double-digit growth in Personal Systems in EMEA, partially offset by declines in Printing. APJ revenue was $5.3 billion, up 1% year-over-year or up 6% in constant currency. We experienced revenue growth in China, primarily on the strength in the Enterprise Group and Printing. In Japan, Personal Systems revenue was very strong, due to the XP migration. Gross margin for the quarter was 24.2%, up 0.5 points year-over-year and up 1.4 points sequentially. Year-over-year, strength in Printing and improvements in Enterprise Services were partially offset by pressure from the strong revenue performance in Personal Systems and weaker Enterprise Group margins due to our competitive pricing environment. Sequentially, most of our businesses improved their gross margins, due to good cost management and pricing discipline. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year, primarily associated with incremental R&D investments. Sequentially, OpEx was up 6% on higher R&D investments, as well as the tough compare, due to the real estate gains we reported in fiscal Q1. As a result, non-GAAP operating profit was $2.3 billion or 8.6% of revenue, flat year-over-year and up 0.1 point sequentially. We recorded $174 million of expense on the other income and expense line. With a 22% tax rate and a weighted average diluted share count of 1.916 billion shares, we delivered second quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.88. Second quarter non-GAAP earnings primarily excludes pretax charges of $264 million for amortization of intangible assets and $252 million for restructuring charges. Now turning to the business units. In Printing, we saw very strong profitability and further traction in key initiatives like Ink in the Office and Ink Advantage, as well as in graphics. However, weak toner sales continue to be a headwind as the hardware installed base remains under pressure. We are focused on placing value-added units to support the installed base throughout the rest of fiscal '14. Total Printing revenue was $5.8 billion, down 4% year-over-year, driven by a decline in supplies revenue, primarily related to lower toner sales. Commercial hardware revenue was $1.4 billion, down 1% year-over-year, while consumer hardware revenue was $566 million, up 1% year-over-year. Total hardware unit shipments grew 1% year-over-year. Ink in the Office and Ink Advantage units and revenue each grew double digits, and we grew share in both ink and laser hardware units. Supplies revenue was $3.9 billion, down 6% over the prior year period, and made up 66.3% of Printing revenue. Although the mix is down 1 point year-over-year, ink is a greater part of the supplies mix, which helped offset the negative impact of lower supplies on overall Printing profitability. Total Printing operating profit was $1.1 billion or 19.5% of revenue, up 3.6 points year-over-year. We saw a positive currency benefit of approximately 1.5 points in second quarter margins, plus we realized some of the benefit from our focus on reducing nonlabor costs and disciplined OpEx management. We expect to reinvest back some of these profits in value-added hardware units. Supplies channel inventory levels remained very slightly above our target range. This was primarily due to softer toner sales in Europe, but we did make progress reducing overall toner channel inventory in the quarter. The Personal Systems Group had a strong quarter. Despite a contracting PC market, revenue in Personal Systems was up 7% year-over-year at $8.2 billion, driven by strong growth in commercial desktops and notebooks. Commercial sales grew 12% year-over-year, with consumer sales down 2%, although consumer notebook revenue grew slightly for the first time since the fiscal 2010 third quarter. Total unit shipments grew 10% year-over-year with growth in both commercial and consumer. Each segment outperformed the market. Total channel inventory remains well within acceptable ranges. Personal Systems operating profit was $290 million or 3.5% of revenue, up 0.3 points year-over-year, driven primarily by favorable mix, partially offset by competitive pricing. Enterprise Group revenue was $6.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by declines in Technology Services, Storage and Business Critical Systems. Operating profit in the quarter was $961 million, or 14.4% of revenue, flat sequentially and down 1.4 points year-over-year as a result of the continued competitive pricing environment and increased investments, primarily in R&D. By business, ISS revenue was $2.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, with strength in EMEA and APJ. Sequentially, revenue declined on lower hyperscale mix, after we completed shipping a large deal in the first quarter. Lower hyperscale mix and good pricing discipline drove gross margins up sequentially again this quarter. While the server market remains very competitive, we believe we are taking the right actions to improve our go-to-market, strengthen our channel and align our cost structure. Technology Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 5% year-over-year. TS revenue continues to be impacted by past declines in hardware sales, but the strategy we have in place remains unchanged and the team is making progress. Penetration rates were up year-over-year, driven by Storage and Networking attach, and we're seeing strong growth in our newer offerings like Proactive Care and Datacenter Care. Profitability in this business continues to be strong. Networking performed well in the quarter. Revenue was $658 million, up 6% year-over-year, with strength in switching across all regions, and we once again outgrew the networking market leader. Storage results, however, were disappointing. Revenue was down 6% versus the prior year period at $808 million. Converged Storage declined 3% year-over-year, and 3PAR plus EVA plus XP also declined but continued to outperform the market. While it's clear we aren't alone in experiencing weakness in the Storage market, we also have an opportunity to improve execution, particularly in the U.S. We still expect Converged Storage to become greater than half of all Storage revenue later this year, but we expect Q2 results to pressure overall Storage revenue for the full year. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 14% year-over-year to $230 million, as strength in mission-critical x86 helped offset the continued impact from the UNIX decline. Enterprise Services revenue was $5.7 billion, down 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued key account runoff. By business, IT outsourcing revenue was $3.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year and applications and business services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Operating profit for ES was $144 million or 2.5% of revenue, flat year-over-year. Sequentially, operating margins were up 1.5 points, driven by ongoing cost management and continued improvement in our underperforming accounts. We expect to see continued progress in both of these areas in the second half of the year, as well as better top line trends, as key account runoff tapers, driving a full year operating profit margin within our outlook range of 3.5% to 4.5%. Although total signings were down year-over-year, strategic Enterprise Services signings were up double digits once again, and we saw encouraging improvement in win rates. Our trailing 12-month book-to-bill was slightly lower, sequentially, as we exited Q2. Signings can be lumpy, but we anticipate improvement in this metric during the second half of the year. Overall, we're making progress on our sales transformation and are seeing a better mix of new logos, but we still have more work to do to successfully pivot to a more proactive sales approach. In Software, revenue was roughly flat over the prior year period at $971 million, with better license revenue due to continued strength in our key focus areas of security and Big Data, offset by lower support revenue. License revenue grew 8% year-over-year, with strength in ArcSight, Fortify, Vertica and Autonomy. Support revenue declined 4% year-over-year, as past license revenue declines continued to create a headwind. Professional Services sales grew 1% year-over-year, driven by strength in security and Big Data. SaaS revenue grew 6% over the prior year period, and we had strong bookings growth in IT management and Autonomy. Operating profit was $186 million or 19.2% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year, primarily driven by continued gross margin expansion in professional services, partially offset by increased investments in R&D. We completed a small software acquisition in the quarter. Shunra provides network virtualization technology, and had no material impact in our financial results in Q2, and isn't expected to materially impact the full year. HP Financial Services revenue was $867 million, down 2% year-over-year. Operating profit was $99 million or 11.4% of revenue. While revenue continues to be impacted by financing volume shortfalls from fiscal '13, new financing volume grew 12% year-over-year. The health of our portfolio of assets remained strong, and return on equity with 18.2%. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We had another strong quarter, generating $3 billion in operating cash flow and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. We continue to focus on working capital and brought our cash conversion cycle down to 13 days in the quarter, helped by a favorable mix with strong Personal Systems revenue and the expansion of our factoring program. Consistent with our efforts to improve our payment terms with key partners that I've talked about in previous quarters, we increased net utilization in our factoring program by approximately $750 million in the quarter. However, we believe many of our customers would've taken advantage of early payment discounts, so we estimate the actual benefit to cash flow to be approximately 1 to 2 days to our cash conversion cycle. For the year, we continue to expect some upside to our original cash flow forecast, as I've talked about last quarter, driven by working capital efficiencies. We further expect the expanded factoring program to provide some additional benefit. In Q2, we accelerated our return to shareholders by repurchasing 26.7 million shares in the quarter, and paid $298 million in dividends. In total, we returned approximately $1.1 billion to shareholders in Q2, and we are still committed to our plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends for the full year. We improved our operating company net cash position by approximately $1 billion for the ninth quarter in a row, and ended Q2 with operating company net cash of $2.7 billion. Now looking forward to Q3. In Printing, we'll continue to focus on placing value-added units and expanding our innovative ink, laser and graphics programs. We expect that toner will remain under pressure for the rest of the year. In Personal Systems, we expect the market to remain challenging and that the upward pressure from higher component costs may limit our ability to pursue upside deals as we focus on profitable growth. Also, don't forget about the Uttar Pradesh deal from last year that will make for a tough revenue compare in Q3. In EG, we have a strong team in place that is focused on aligning our cost structure, managing our margin profile and improving our go-to-market execution across the businesses while investing for long-term success. In ES, as I've talked about, we expect the ongoing actions we're taking to improve our cost structure and our underperforming accounts, along with the tapering of revenue runoff, to result in better profitability in the second half of the year. In Software, we expect to see continued traction in key growth areas like Big Data and security, while we invest in the business and manage our portfolio's transition to SaaS. Across all of our businesses, competing and winning in today's challenging environment requires Lean organizations, with a focus on strong performance management. We're optimizing our workforce and reengineering our business processes to both build a strong operational foundation and create capacity for investments to drive future growth. Through this ongoing focus, we've identified incremental opportunity as I have signaled in the past quarters, and we now expect approximately 45,000 to 50,000 people to leave the company under our announced 2012 restructuring program. This is up from our previous estimate of 34,000. We expect a total of approximately 41,000 people to leave by the end of fiscal 2014, with the remainder in 2015. We expect this to create additional run rate savings in fiscal '16 of approximately $1 billion per year on top of what we've previously laid out, although we expect some of this will be reinvested back into the business. In fiscal '14, we expect approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of incremental savings, and estimated incremental charge of approximately $500 million, and an additional cash flow impact of approximately $200 million in the second half of fiscal '14. We will provide further clarity on the specific FY '15 impact to P&L and cash flow when we provide our outlook for the next year at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. As we said, we won't do additional restructuring at a corporate level after this program is complete. However, each business will continue to drive workforce rebalancing and will account for those changes within the segment P&L. With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.63 to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q3, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $0.86 to $0.90. From a GAAP perspective, we expect a full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $2.80, and GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q3 is expected to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.63. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Cathie. Before we go to questions, I'm sure you all noticed that, earlier today, the HP press release and earnings went live before the appropriate time, and we are sorry about that and we'll make sure that, that doesn't happen again. So now, we'll go on to questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Keith Bachman with Bank of MontrÃ©al.
Keith Bachman: I have 2, if I could. The first one, Meg, you're taking some incremental costs out of the system with the additional headcount targets. It clearly says that you're -- it would seem to suggest that you're disappointed in some areas. Where, specifically, is the headcount coming out of in the system? Where are the targets? And I have a follow-up, please.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, sure. So you'll recall that this program goes back to FY '12, and we've actually increased the number of people who will leave the company a couple of times during this program. And actually, on earlier calls, we actually signaled that there might be more opportunity. And I'm actually not disappointed at all with how we're doing. We just see more opportunities to lower our cost structure, streamline our operations without impairing our effectiveness, in fact, making us a more nimble and decisive company. And the longer I've been here, I see opportunities where we can become even better. So that's the genesis of the program. It will be across almost all the business units and across all the geographies and, particularly, in some of the functional areas that sort of helped the businesses grow. So listen, I'm not at all disappointed. I think it's the natural course of what makes sense in a turnaround of this size and scale.
Catherine Lesjak: The other thing that I'd add real quickly is just that it's going to create more capacity to invest, and I think that's really important to HP, because, as Meg has talked many times, the turnaround and our success in this turnaround is going to be on the strength of the innovative products and solutions that we bring to market.
Keith Bachman: Okay, on my follow-up then, if I could, I wanted to turn to the Printing business. I was a little bit surprised to hear you say that the installed base seems to be declining with the good unit placements that you had for the last 3 to 4 quarters. And it really speaks to the supplies. The supplies, I thought, was disappointing this quarter, and it sounds like you're saying it's going to continue to be under pressure. If you could just flesh out a little bit more some of your comments on the Printing business in particular.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. Let me start with the comment about the installed base largely relates to laser hardware and the softness in supplies largely relates to toner. Actually, ink is doing reasonably well. And this actually goes back a number of years. You recall that we, for about 7 years, didn't probably make the necessary product innovations in terms of the next generation of these machines in terms of multifunction printers. And it's also important on Managed Print Services business, we were late to that market and we're catching up fast. So we're going to place the right units. We now have the right products, not only for multifunction printers to direct customers and through the channel, but also importantly, for our Managed Print Services. So I think, as Cathie said, we'll see some softening in toner through the rest of the year, and then I think we'll start to see more normal patterns. And I think Cathie wants to add one thing to that.
Catherine Lesjak: I just -- I think the absolute size of the installed base is one dimension, but it's also the quality of the installed base. So if we place a unit today that has a much higher usage like an Ink in the Office unit or an Ink Advantage unit, and that's replacing a unit that didn't have as high usage. We actually are doing exactly what we want to do, so you got to be focused on the size of the installed base as well as the quality.
Operator: We have Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I wanted to follow up on the last question in terms of the restructuring and anticipation of this. It just strikes me as odd that you have a 2012 restructuring plan that is doing significant incremental workforce restructuring in 2015. My understanding originally was 27,000 was what was needed to rightsize the company, then it went to 30,000 or 29,000, and then it went to 34,000, and now it's going to 50,000. And to me, it feels like a whole new restructuring effort and a whole new outlook on the business. And I can't help wondering why something so significant has come up relatively suddenly. Moreover, I'd like to get your input on your confidence for 2015, because clearly, $1 billion in incremental savings is significant and should be applauded. But is that a message that you're not as confident that you can grow EPS in 2015 without this workforce rebalancing? So in other words, do you think HP will grow in 2015? And is the reason for this incremental workforce rebalancing, because you've lost confidence or you don't have as much confidence in the company's ability to grow top line in 2015?
Margaret Whitman: So Toni, let me take that, and I'll let Cathie talk about guidance, because we're not actually going to give guidance today for 2015. But this actually has nothing to do with our confidence in the business. This has to do with really now understanding the opportunities that we have to make this company better. You've got to remember, this company was built over many years by acquisition, has 5 major business units, we sell through 150,000 VARs, we operate in 166 countries. And as you look at our processes, as you look at how we go to market, as you look at things like sales ops and marketing and frictionless e-commerce, there are so many opportunities to improve this company. And we went after the ones that were immediately obvious. But the longer I'm here and this management team is here, the more opportunities we see, and we think that's good news. That's good news because it makes us easier for customers to do business with, it makes it easier, frankly, for employees to get things done here and, by the way, has an added benefit of making us lower cost, so we're better able to compete in the new world order. But my view is I've done a number of turnarounds in my career, not at this scale, I will say, but they are always -- you see more opportunities, the deeper that you get in. And so I'm actually quite excited about the opportunities it provides. And Cathie said it well, it does give us the capacity to bring money to the bottom line, but frankly, also invest in the things that are going to help this company grow in a sustainable way over the future.
Catherine Lesjak: And Toni, I would add, we actually tried to signal this at the Security Analyst Meeting and then on the earnings call last quarter, because we knew we were working feverishly to understand the reengineering possibilities and what kind of ramifications that would have for the headcount that we need to run this company. And really, what I view us doing now is just finally getting to the point of quantifying for you all what that looks like. But it's been work that's been ongoing since last year.
Margaret Whitman: And I'll just say, in terms of revenue, I think the good news is we've seen revenue stabilization in the last 3 quarters. I mean, it wasn't that long ago when this company was declining 7%, 6%, 9% quarter-over-quarter, and we've had 3 quarters of, basically, flat growth. To me, that's encouraging because you've got to stabilize before you can grow. And you can see the improvement in virtually all the different businesses.
Operator: We have Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Given Services signings are coming in slower than expected. Is this an area where it makes sense to acquire for growth? And then just as a follow-up to that, full year Services margin guidance requires you to exit the year around 6%. Cathie, can you just talk in more detail around where that meaningful improvement comes from over the next couple of quarters?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, let me speak to the signings and the revenue growth. I think, as we said at SAM, and as we've said quarter-over-quarter, we're in the early innings of the sales transition to drive a much more proactive sales approach. And while total signings were down a bit, year-over-year, the places that we want to grow, what we call strategic Enterprise Services signings, were up double digits once again, and we saw a very encouraging improvement in win rates and actually signed over 200 new logos, which is actually a big turnaround for the sales organization over there. So we've got more work to do, but I'm feeling confident that we're pivoting the sales organization to be more proactive, and I think we're being invited to a lot more bids, if you will, than we had in the past, because I'm seeing it every day. Customers are much more confident in HP and much more confident in our Services business.
Margaret Whitman: And, Katy, let me address the margin question. We've made good progress in improving both our underperforming accounts, as well as really realizing good savings out of productivity initiatives. And we expect that this progress will continue in both of these areas throughout fiscal '14. And then if you couple that with better top line trends, we do expect that we will operate -- have operating profit margins in the 3.5% to 4.5% for the year. Again, we've got to continue to execute well. We've got to take advantage of the restructuring that we -- the previous restructuring that, by the way, is a bit accelerating, as well as this incremental program. But we are starting to get labor out of some of the protected geos, what tends to be higher cost. And we're also focused not just on labor savings but also on nonlabor savings that come from better efficiency across processes, consolidating service centers, looking at data center automation, all of which that will help us reach these margins of 3.5% to 4.5%.
Operator: We have Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: I got to just ask you to clarify your answer to Toni's question, because if you're getting $0.40 in run rate savings by 2016, with such a big increase in the headcount reductions, I mean, what are we supposed to do here? I mean, are we supposed to raise our out-year numbers? We can't just wait for the Analyst Day. We kind of need to know what you guys are thinking. $0.40 in 2016 kind of means we have to raise our estimates unless something really changes with the top line. So I know you want us to wait for the Analyst Day, but a lot of us got to make a decision by tomorrow. So we really need some clarity there. And then I just would also like to know, on the free cash flow side, your preference for buybacks versus acquisitions at this point of outperformance?
Margaret Whitman: Ben, I'm not exactly sure how to answer that question. You know that we don't provide guidance for the future until we get to our Security Analyst Meeting, and that's really no different than what we've ever done. What I will say is that the gross savings of $1 billion is incremental to the $3.5 billion to $4 billion that we announced for the 34,000. Those are gross savings. They are -- there is a cost to migrate some of that work, and so those are not the net savings. In fiscal '14, we do expect that the net savings from this incremental program is $0.02 to $0.03, and stay tuned for fiscal '15's update at the Security Analyst Meeting.
Operator: We have Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Just have a question on the PC side. You've had -- you've seen nice growth the last 2 quarters in a row, especially on the commercial side. Could you maybe just talk about how much of the growth you think is driven by Windows XP going end-of-life, or there's maybe more other factors in play as you go through the rest of the year?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. I mean, for the market, overall, we're seeing some good signs of stabilization, particularly in commercial PCs, which was up 2% year-over-year. And by the way, there is some strength in EMEA, flat year-over-year for the first time in 7 quarters, so the market's definitely stabilizing. I think we are benefiting from the migration from XP to Windows. We saw that in spades in Japan. Had a very, very strong quarter in Japan as that migration took place. We actually think that migration is going to extend for some period of time, maybe another 12 to 18 months, but we also see some momentum in what I would call a long-overdue PC refresh. And frankly, the fact that companies are realizing there's a need for a productivity tool that's different than just the tablet. So listen, I think we expect, over time, this is still to be a low-growth to slightly negative growth category, but I think we actually have a bit of wind at our backs over the next year to 18 months. I also actually have to call out credit to our team, our leadership team led by Dion Weisler. I mean they have focused on profitable growth, creating incredibly compelling products, very crisp market segmentation, leveraging our distribution strength in commercial and go-to-market, and really focusing on only doing profitable growth, not share for share's sake. So it's a combination of all those things, I think.
Amit Daryanani: That's helpful. Let me just follow up on the cost-cutting initiative that you're expanding this quarter. What's the comfort level that this is the final number and there shouldn't be another expansion for this? Because since you started in May of 2012, this number is close to double in total headcount. So maybe just start with the comfort that this is it. And secondly, how does this play out for the morale of the company, given the headcount cuts seem to almost accelerate a little bit over -- every 6 months.
Margaret Whitman: So listen, I don't anticipate an additional program. And after this -- the end of this program, obviously, we've got to -- we are in the process of building productivity into the HP DNA into our business unit and function DNA. And so that productivity that ever ongoing quest for efficiency will be borne by the P&L of each of these different business units. But again, I would just say that this company had been through a lot. The acquisition of Compaq, the acquisition of EDS, 11 to 20 software acquisitions, a lot of change. And part of what we're doing is we are integrating, we're streamlining, we're putting in new ERP programs. We're investing in systems and technology to automate processes that frankly had not been done in a while. And so I actually think this is good news that we are continuing to take advantage of the opportunities that we see. However what I will tell you is I don't anticipate an additional program after this.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me address, then, the second part of Ben's question. I apologize I didn't catch that one. So, Ben, I think your question was around capital allocation and how we're thinking about that. We are still committed to the capital allocation approach that we outlined in our Security Analyst Meeting, which means that between dividends and share repurchases, we do anticipate returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to investors in fiscal '14. And we will see the timing of the share repurchase activity levels will vary quarter-to-quarter. But I think it's really important that given the attractiveness of the valuation of HP shares, as well as our anticipated cash flow generation level, our approach to capital allocation will have a bias towards share repurchases. When we then shift to kind of what about M&A, as we've talked about, we will evaluate any M&A using a returns-based framework. And any of the near-term considerations in terms of what types of things we might be interested in are absolutely going to be our strategic focus areas such as cloud, security and Big Data.
Margaret Whitman: And let me answer your question about morale. So listen, no company likes to decrease their workforce, and we recognize that it is difficult for employees. What I will tell you is I think our employees live it every single day. The environment that we're in, our employees know that there is ways we can be more efficient. They are, in some ways, the biggest source of ideas on what we can do differently. So I think everyone understands the turnaround we're in. Everyone understands the market realities. Everyone understands the need to create financial capacity to invest in innovation, which will be our point of difference and making sure that we have the right sales force coverage in every geography. So I don't think anyone likes this, but I think, actually, we've done a good of job explaining where we are in the turnaround, what the strategy is and what's going to be required to get HP to where we all want it to be in the industry.
Operator: We have Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank.
Sherri Scribner: I wanted to get a little more detail on the pause in the Storage business. You did give us some detail, but I guess I was a little surprised to hear that the Converged piece, actually, saw some deceleration. So maybe some more detail on do you think you're losing share or do you think there's something more systemic that's going on in the industry right now?
Margaret Whitman: So we actually think we'll gain 1 point at Storage in this market. I think what's going on here, and listen, I'm not sure anyone has total clarity on this, but as I have talked to customers, here is what I've learned when I talked to our sales team, is effectively, there's an efficiency thing going on here around compression and team provisioning. And then of course flash is on the horizon in a much more important way than it has been in the past. And then what's interesting is the high end, you can now get high-end performance for mid-tier pricing. And so there's, I think, a lot of choices now in front of storage buyers, whether it's small to medium-size to the big enterprises. And so my sense of the situation there is there's a pause, trying to figure out what the right thing to do is, and that this market will come back in the second half. Obviously, we have to wait to see that happen, but that is what most of our customers and our partners are telling me. And the good news is we are completely, perfectly positioned for where this market is going. And 3PAR is the exact right product. The flash product is exactly the right products, and we are -- I think we're really well-positioned for where the market is going. Obviously, no one knows exactly what's going to happen. If this market doesn't rebound in the next half, then there's another situation that we're facing. But I don't actually think that's the case. And again, we'll gain probably 1 point of share in this calendar quarter.
Operator: We have Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Maybe back to the M&A question. Given the stronger cash flow outlook that you expect this year, I'm just curious how that impacts the appetite to make larger acquisitions than what you've previously discussed. I think you said in the past, small to medium-size, but with the cash flow continuing to outperform, how should we think about deal size now?
Margaret Whitman: Well, first and foremost, I'll just reiterate what I've said, is we expect to be return-focused in our approach to acquisition. And as I said before, we don't feel the need for large transformative acquisitions. We haven't put a specific size range or limits on this, but I'd say they are most likely in the range -- from the small, low-hundreds-of-millions to mid-sized deals. And we'll largely be in the area of those -- of the strategic focus for HP, which would be, largely, cloud, security, Big Data that we think will advance our positions in those businesses.
Operator: We have Kulbinder Garcha with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: And again on the restructuring, I guess for Meg, maybe if I ask the question this way, has your revenue visibility for this business, over the medium term, or the growth outlook that you've had, whatever that might be, in any way significantly changed in the past 6 months that may have prompted some of these incremental restructuring you're pursuing? And then linked to that, previously, you made it very clear, both you and Cathie, that you're going to invest a large part of the initial round of savings. Would the retention of savings be significantly higher on this next round? Or you're essentially valuing them?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So I'll say my outlook has actually not changed in terms of where we are in the turnaround, what my view is of the revenue trajectory. We obviously live in a market that's shifting at warp speed. This is the fastest market shift I've seen in my career, and by the way, you know I grew up mostly in the consumer space, which tends to move faster than the enterprise space. I would actually say I'm feeling more confident because we have seen a stabilization of revenue. The very high single-digit declines are over. We've had 3 quarters of pretty good stabilization, and I really like our product roadmap. Many folks who have been around HP for many, many, many years have said this is the product lineup -- best product lineup we've had in a decade. So I feel confident in it. What I will say is that we need to run this company more efficiently, not only for the benefit of cost, which is good because then we can reinvest in things that will make us stronger, but frankly, in terms of ease of doing business, ease of working here and faster, more nimble decision-making. We're going to have to be quicker and faster and more nimble to compete in this new world order. And by the way, having a lower cost structure is an added benefit to that. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
Catherine Lesjak: No, I think you're exactly right.
Operator: We have Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: I have a question on the Printing segment. Even excluding the tailwind you discussed, your operating margin strength was fairly substantial, given a 6% decline in supplies. Can you give us a bit more detail on the components of the Printing margin and, particularly, what's occurring within hardware margins? I understand you have more ink mix on the supply side, but what's going on within hardware margins, and what do you view as sustainable outside of the yen impact?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Bill, so the increase in margins year-over-year, 3.6 points, the currency is about 1.5 points. And then the rest is really strong cost management, and it's across the portfolio. It's not a hardware comment versus a supplies comment. It is a comment about making sure that we've got the right cost structure. And then offsetting that a little bit is unfavorable mix. But it's really important that we step back a bit. We talked about, at the Security Analyst Meeting in October, the fact that we expected from IPG $0.07 to $0.11 of incremental EPS, and that was before incremental investment that we talked about at the time of being $0.12 across the company, and now we've upped it to $0.14. So we've got to stay -- we've got to remain focused on investing for the long term in this business, that means placing units, that means continuing to invest in R&D. We think there's a real opportunity to increase the amount of print specialists across the world, so we're focused on doing that. And it's also really exploiting these business models: Ink Advantage, Ink in the Office, our multifunction printer lineup and our Managed Print Services. Those are all really important points that we've got to stay focused on. And then finally, I'd say that we've got to continue to be very competitive. The market is tough. We've got Japanese competitors who have an even bigger war chest as a result of the yen depreciation. And so we will be more aggressive where we need to be.
Operator: We have Rod Hall with JPMorgan.
Rod Hall: I just wanted to ask you guys if you could talk a little bit about some R&D increase. I know you gave a little bit of color, but could you give us a little bit more color in that area, just what you're increasing, what you're focusing on with the additional R&D? And then I know it's a question that's been asked a bunch of times, but the $0.02 to $0.03 that you expect to realize in net savings here at the -- in the last part of this year, can you talk to us about the phasing of the savings over the period? Is most of that to $0.02 to $0.03 coming in fiscal Q4? Or is it coming linear when you cross the 2 quarters? Help us understand how that's ramping through the back end of the year.
Margaret Whitman: Okay. So let me start with that last question, that -- those $0.02 to $0.03, there's a little bit that happened in Q3 and a little bit that happened in Q4. If you actually go and look at the guidance that we provided for EPS, the midpoint would suggest that -- and we've got it flat sequentially. Normal seasonality would suggest it would be down about 1 point. The restructuring savings are actually bringing it to being flat sequentially, so that will give you a little indication of what's going on from a Q3 perspective. And I'm sorry, I've lost track of your first question. R&D. So in terms of R&D, the increase in R&D, year-over-year, is actually very broad-based. Just about every business that we have is increasing R&D on a year-over-year basis. Obviously, it's focused in strategic areas: cloud, Big Data, security, PageWide array, 3D printing. Kind of across the board, we're increasing R&D, so it's really not a specific comment for a particular business.
Catherine Lesjak: And I'll just say that actually, we've increased R&D in servers. We love our roadmap. We love the opportunities there, and we're pretty excited about some of the innovation that's coming down the pike there.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, so we've got R&D increases in EG, in Storage -- within that, we got Storage, we've got Industry Standard Servers. I mean it's really broad-based that we're making incremental R&D investments year-over-year.
Operator: We have Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Meg, when you think about a lot of things are changing in the industry. On the server-side, you got Lenovo purchasing the IBM x86 series. It seems like there's a lot of disruption going on and an opportunity for HP to gain share in servers, as we're seeing a lot of CTOs kind of confused and not sure how that will all pan out. Can you help us confirm if, indeed, you expect to gain some shift? Not to be blunt but it would probably seem like a blatant mis-execution step if HP doesn't take advantage of this on the very near term, as an opportunity.
Margaret Whitman: So we're focused on this, and there's some early signs that show that we're making some progress, as we've seen an increase in win rates attributable almost directly to the uncertainty in the marketplace, around the IBM business moving to Lenovo, and we're building pipeline for future incremental deals. So good win rates, good pipeline, feeling good about this. It's a longer sales cycle than you think, particularly in blades and some of these other areas. This takes a bit of time, but I think we are -- we have got the sales team focused on this. They're pretty excited about it. And it's an open door that we're running through.
Rob Binns: With that, I think we'll conclude the questions.
Margaret Whitman: Great. Thank you very much for joining us today.
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2014 Q1  (2014-02-20 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ellen, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.

I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first quarter of fiscal 2014 closed, HP is in a stronger position than we have been in quite some time. Since laying out our 5-year strategic roadmap for turning the company around, we've made significant progress. We have reignited innovation of HP, and the first quarter was no exception as we introduced industry-leading technologies across our portfolio. Our focus on rebuilding our balance sheet has resulted in an improvement of our operating company net cash position by more than $6 billion since the first quarter of 2013. We strengthened our relationship with customers and channel partners, something I see every day in my interactions with them. And our global workforce is fully aligned behind the common vision for the company, delivering solutions for the New Style of IT. And we are seeing acceleration in the industry's movement towards that New Style of IT. These changes create tremendous pressure in the marketplace. As technologies and business models evolve, customer needs change and incumbents look to respond. Many of our competitors are now confronting these new realities by making major strategic shifts and exiting significant parts of their business. At the same time, HP is more than 2 years into its work to reposition the company to meet these challenges. We believe this is a competitive advantage. With the steps we've taken, I think we're well positioned to seize on opportunities that will arise in the marketplace. We still have a long way to go, but I am more convinced than ever that we are making the right moves to set HP up for the long term. Rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the pedal. Over the next few quarters, we will introduce significant new innovations that will build upon our offerings in cloud, security, Big Data and Converged Infrastructure, as well as some remarkable new technologies in Printing and Personal Systems. In addition, at our Global Partner Conference next month, we will roll out updates to our partner programs that we expect will further strengthen our channel relationships. We are doing all of this, while we continue to optimize our cost base and invest in our infrastructure to help create a more agile and more aggressive HP. In the first quarter, HP delivered $0.90 in diluted non-GAAP net earnings per share compared to our financial outlook of $0.82 to $0.86 per share. Total revenue for the company was down 1% for the quarter but up slightly in constant currency, and we once again delivered very strong cash flow, generating $3 billion in cash flow from operations. As a result of our focus on driving cash flow, the company exited the quarter with an operating company net cash position of $1.7 billion after returning $843 million to shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividend and share repurchases. We saw further encouraging signs in the quarter that our efforts to turn the company around are taking hold. There was revenue growth in our Personal Systems and Enterprise Group segments, and at the total company level, on a constant-currency basis, we achieved revenue growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2011. As I've said in the past, turnarounds are not linear, and we have a lot of work ahead of us. While I would certainly not declare victory based on these results, they represent real progress. Make no mistake. We are focused on consistently and profitably growing revenue over the long term. You've heard me say that revenue growth will ultimately be driven by great products. And in the first quarter, we held our annual innovation showcase for our European customers at HP Discover in Barcelona. We used the event to introduce some significant new technologies in key areas for the company. We introduced our new Converged System portfolio, a family of integrated IT systems using HP server, storage and networking technology that is purpose-built for key workloads, such as virtualization, Big Data and hosted desktops. These new products deliver a total systems experience that dramatically simplifies IT, enabling customers to go from order to operations in as little as 20 days. We also introduced new solutions in our Converged Storage portfolio, including StoreOnce Backup, StoreAll Archive and StoreServe Storage. Collectively, these innovations deliver industry-leading performance and efficiency, making it possible for enterprises to manage their data in the New Style of IT. We announced the next generation of our flagship private cloud solutions, CloudSystem 8. This solution integrates with our OpenStack architecture and enables enterprises to build a private cloud and deploy cloud services in a matter of hours rather than days or weeks. HP was also recently recognized by Forrester Research as the clear leader in private cloud solutions. We also launched our new hybrid cloud management platform, a self-service portal with key management and security tools that allow IT managers to more efficiently deliver applications and services to their users. Also in the first quarter, our Personal Systems Group introduced 2 new mobile devices to the market in India: the HP Slate 6 and Slate 7 VoiceTabs. These phablets demonstrate how we are clearly segmenting markets to target opportunities with cost-effective products that play to our strengths. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q1 were driven by the revenue growth I noted earlier, plus solid performance in Printing and disciplined cost management. In Personal Systems, we delivered strong revenue performance. Overall, the PC market contraction is slowing, and we see signs of stabilization, particularly in the commercial segment. Revenue grew 4% over the prior year, our first quarter of growth in 7 quarters. Growth was driven by strong performance in commercial, particularly commercial notebooks. Operating margins in the quarter were 3.3%, up over both the prior year and sequentially. The competitive pricing environment remains aggressive, which puts pressure on our gross margins. We are being selective in where we play, and as a result, we lost 0.7 points of market share over the prior year in a declining market in the calendar fourth quarter and 0.9 points sequentially. We believe our approach of being selective about where we play, coupled with good cost discipline, will ensure we remain focused on profitable growth. Our Printing business delivered solid results with sustained profitability. Operating margins for the first quarter were 16.8%, up 0.5 points over the prior year. Printing revenue was down 2% or 1% in constant currency. And while total supplies revenue declined, we did see growth in ink supplies over the prior year. We also saw our third successive quarter of hardware unit placement growth, driven by very strong growth in laser units, and Ink in the Office remained strong. The focus on unit placement is an investment that we believe will pay future dividends for supplies. The overall printing market for hardware unit growth for the second successive quarter, driven by strength in laser. For the third successive quarter, HP outperformed the market, getting 2 points of share over the prior year in total and in both ink and laser, respectively. In Enterprise Services, a soft revenue quarter pressured margins. As we laid out on our last call, delayed revenue runoff from FY '13 is impacting year-over-year compares for ES. In the first quarter, runoffs occurred largely as we expected and resulted in a 1% operating margin, down 30 basis points over the prior year. We're in the early innings of the transition we outlined in October to drive a more proactive sales approach. In the first quarter, we did see encouraging bookings growth in strategic Enterprise Services, but there remains further opportunity for us to improve our success in winning new large customers and securing add-on revenue from existing accounts. I'm confident that we have the right plan in services, and the team has made good progress executing against their strategy. But this is a big ship to turn, and we need to move faster, particularly on aligning our sales engine and improving our service delivery for higher quality and lower cost. In the Enterprise Group, we saw revenue growth of 1% and expect calendar fourth quarter share gains across all our hardware segments. Results in the first quarter were led by revenue growth in ISS and networking, partially offset by revenue decline in TS. We saw stable performance in storage where we continue to manage the transition from traditional to converged storage. Finally, we continue to see revenue declines in Business Critical Systems. Overall, we are still seeing a very competitive pricing environment in EG. Over time, we do expect to improve margins in this business. There is more we can do. And as we look forward, we remain focused on better matching our product mix to market segments, cost-saving opportunities and improving attach rates to drive increased operating margins. In Industry Standard Servers, we continue to make progress in stabilizing this business in the first quarter. We had another strong hyperscale quarter although this contributes to pressured margins. In addition, we continue to make progress with Moonshot as we rolled that new workloads in the first quarter and introduced the first Converged System for hosted desktops based on Moonshot technology. Customer interest remains high, and we're working with a number of customers on proof of concepts addressing a variety of different workloads. In Storage, overall revenue was flat. In Converged Storage, we saw 42% revenue growth over the prior year, and 3PAR continues to perform very well, particularly in the midrange segments. In Networking, we grew revenue 4% over the prior year. We saw good performance in switching, which grew revenue 5% over the prior year, comparing very favorably against Cisco's results in the same period. In Technology Services, revenue declined 4% over the prior year but only down 2% in constant currency. We continue to see good adoption of our new portfolio, including Proactive Care, where orders grew triple digits year-over-year; and Flexible Capacity Services, where we are seeing strong customer demand. In Software, I feel good about the progress we are making. We have simplified the product line while rejuvenating our core portfolio. We are investing in key growth areas, and the team is making great strides on area of operational improvement. Revenue was down 4% over the prior year, but we grew in key areas of the portfolio, including security, cloud and Big Data. Weakness on our traditional IT management business, particularly in the U.S. and Asia, was partially offset by strength in security offerings like ArcSight and Fortify, as well as in our Vertica business. In Autonomy, the technology continues to resonate very well with customers as we launched IDOL 10 and Data Protector 8.1, the industry's first adaptive and self-aware backup and recovery solutions. In addition, Autonomy announced a major win with China Mobile, selecting IDOL to power the search capability of its strategic wireless city platform. This platform allows users to access information on thousands of public services directly from their mobile phones. So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made, but we still have a lot of work to do to drive consistent execution and navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace. Now let me turn to our future outlook. The approach we outlined at our Security Analyst Meeting last fall remains our compass to guide us in FY '14. We will continue to focus on innovation, cash flow, our restructuring plans and executing on the areas of improvement in the turnaround while taking advantage of the realities of the New Style of IT. We are not expecting any significant change in the macro environment. There are definitely some encouraging signs with improved performance in Western Europe, but headwinds remain in many emerging markets. Against that backdrop, our Q2 outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share will be $0.85 to $0.89. And for the full year, the outlook will be $3.60 to $3.75. So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Overall, Q1 was a good start to fiscal '14 as some of the fundamental improvements we've been driving are beginning to take hold. But as Meg noted, we still are not satisfied with the consistency of our performance or the profitability across some of our businesses. So we remain very focused on improving our go-to-market and cost structure. Total revenue for the quarter was $28.2 billion, down 0.7% year-over-year and up 0.3% in constant currency. By region, Americas revenue was $12.5 billion, down 2% year-over-year or down 1% in constant currency. The decline was primarily due to key account runoffs in Enterprise Services in the U.S., partially offset by our previously announced sale of IP. EMEA revenue was $10.4 billion, up 1% year-over-year but down 1% in constant currency. While our EMEA outlook remains cautious, we are seeing some signs of stabilization in more mature markets such as Germany and France. APJ revenue was $5.2 billion, down 1% year-over-year but up 5% in constant currency. We saw particular strength in India again this quarter, and China was flat. Relative to overall market challenges in the region, we are pleased with this performance. Gross margin for the quarter was 22.8%, up 0.5 points year-over-year and down 0.2 points sequentially. The year-over-year improvement included some benefits from the IP sale. We continue to experience an aggressive pricing environment across our hardware businesses, which we are offsetting through productivity improvements and greater service delivery efficiencies. Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4 billion, down 1.8% year-over-year and down 1.4% sequentially. R&D expense was up over the prior-year period, as we continue to invest in innovation in our strategic focus areas, such as cloud, and across many of our business segments. SG&A was down over the prior-year period, primarily due to gains from our real estate sale and expense benefit from our restructuring actions. These benefits were partially offset by higher litigation reserves and investments in systems and tools. As a result, non-GAAP operating profit was $2.4 billion or 8.5% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year. We recorded $153 million of expense in the other income and expense line, a decrease from the prior-year period, driven primarily by lower interest expense on reduced debt balances, partially offset by the unfavorable effects of currency exchange rates. With a 22% tax rate and a weighted-average diluted share count of 1.935 billion shares, we delivered first quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.90. First quarter non-GAAP earnings primarily excludes pretax charges of $283 million for amortization of intangible assets and $114 million for restructuring charges. Turning to the business units. Printing continued to perform well with solid hardware unit growth for the third consecutive quarter and good profitability, as we continue to push our Print strategies forward. Revenue was $5.8 billion, down 2.2% year-over-year, and unit shipments grew 5%. Commercial hardware revenue was $1.3 billion, down 2% year-over-year while consumer hardware revenue was $673 million, down just 1% year-over-year. We have seen contraction in average selling prices across ink and laser hardware, driven by the tough pricing environment and the improving. For example, demand for our Ink in the Office products remained strong. The OfficeJet Pro X saw double-digit sequential growth across all regions, and we continue to see double-digit, year-over-year revenue and unit growth in Ink Advantage. In laser, we gained share and are continuing to grow in multi-function printers and managed services, and graphics remains a bright spot with another solid performance in Indigo. Supplies revenue was down 3% over the prior-year period or down just 1% in constant currency and made up 65% of Printing revenue. Supplies softness was attributable to weakness in toner. Softer toner drove channel inventory levels marginally up above our target range. We're actively managing this, and the net impact to Q1 results was immaterial. Overall, Printing profitability remains solid with operating profit of $1 billion or 16.8% of revenue, up 0.5 points year-over-year. The performance in Personal Systems was better than expected with revenue of $8.5 billion, up 3.6% year-over-year, driven by commercial strength. There were signs of improved market conditions, especially in commercial PC, and we are confident about our portfolio and focus. Although consumer sales declined 3% year-over-year, commercial sales grew 8%. Commercial notebooks grew double digits over the prior-year period and commercial desktops were up as well. Total unit shipments grew 6% year-over-year with growth in both the commercial and consumer segments. Channel inventory levels are down and well within acceptable ranges across all categories and regions. Personal Systems operating profit was $279 million or 3.3% of revenue, up 0.5 points year-over-year. The results of our continued focus on cost management and the IP sale were partially offset by increased DRAM costs, as we indicated to you last quarter. We remain focused on driving profitable growth in this business. Enterprise Group revenue was $7 billion, up 0.6% year-over-year and up 1.5% in constant currency. Operating profit in the quarter was $1 billion or 14.4% of revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. We believe these results show the progress we are making on sales execution and the competitiveness of our portfolio, as the market shifts towards the New Style of IT. However, we still have more work to do to improve profitability in the business. As Bill Veghte discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting, we are focused on specific actions like optimizing our cost structure, more closely aligning the business units in the regions and better segmenting the market. By business, Industry Standard Server revenue was $3.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, as we saw strong growth in hyperscale again this quarter. Technology Services revenue decline has moderated somewhat, with total revenue of $2.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. The profitability expanded and customer satisfaction improved. When you consider the significant headwind of the declining BCS business, the Technology Services operating profit performance was strong. In Storage and Networking, we're driving execution improvements to capture more market opportunity, and we're starting to see the results. Networking revenue growth started to accelerate in the first quarter. Revenue was $630 million in the quarter, up 4% year-over-year. Storage revenue was flat versus the prior-year period at $834 million, as strong growth in Converged Storage offset declines in traditional storage. Converged Storage grew 42% year-over-year, and 3PAR plus EVA plus XP grew 13% faster than the market again this quarter. This metric indicates how well 3PAR is performing in disrupting the marketplace, taking into account the planned transition of our traditional offerings. Business Critical Systems continues to be impacted by declining units market. BCS revenue declined 25% year-over-year to $228 million. We expect to gain 2 points of share in this market. Enterprise Services revenue was $5.6 billion, down 7.3% year-over-year. The revenue decline was driven by the delayed key account runoffs, as we indicated to you previously. The revenue decline, along with the investments we are making in our sales force and increased litigation reserves on legacy accounts, pressured our margins in the quarter. Operating profit was $57 million or 1% of revenue, down 0.3 points year-over-year. By business, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.5 billion, down 9% year-over-year; and Applications and Business Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Both businesses were impacted by the key account runoffs. Overall, signing was soft in Q1, but small and medium deals grew. Overall, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill is still within acceptable ranges. We've made some progress on improving productivity, but we have to move faster to drive service delivery efficiencies, grow add-on business within existing accounts and capture new logos. Software revenue declined 3.7% over the prior-year period to $916 million, although we saw continued growth in key areas, such SaaS, Vertica and security, and gained traction in our innovative Big Data platform, HAVEn. License revenue declined 6% year-over-year due to continued market transition to Saas, as well as some pressure in our IT management business. However, we saw double-digit growth in cloud, Vertica and Autonomy's IDOL license revenues. Support sales declined 2% year-over-year as a result of historical license revenue declines. Professional Services sales declined 12% year-over-year, but the gross margin improved as we continue to prune our portfolio and focus on profitability. SaaS revenue grew 6% over prior-year period as we see continued momentum. Operating profit was $145 million or 15.8% of revenue, down 0.5 points year-over-year. We continue to invest in strategic growth areas of Software and make progress on simplifying and enhancing our systems and processes to increase productivity. HP Financial Services revenue was $870 million, down 9.1% year-over-year. Operating profit was $101 million or 11.6% of revenue, up 1 point from Q1 fiscal '13. Pressure from volume declines in previous quarters impacted HP Financial Services revenue. However, new financing volume was up double digits, driven by strength in the direct customer financing business. The health of our portfolio assets was strong, and return on equity was 18% in the quarter. Turning to cash flow and capital allocation. We had another strong quarter, generating $3 billion in operating cash flow, up 17% year-over-year, which resulted in $2.4 billion in free cash flow. We continued our focus on working capital and got our cash conversion cycle down to 16 days in the first quarter, down 7 days from the prior-year period. We improved across all metrics, but the largest improvement was in days payable outstanding. We returned $565 million to shareholders by repurchasing 20.4 million shares in the quarter and paid $278 million in the form of dividends. For the year, we are still committed to capital distributions and our plan to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, as we outlined in the Security Analyst Meeting. During the quarter, we also completed a very successful $2 billion debt offering, our first term debt issuance in almost 2 years. We ended the quarter with gross cash of $16.4 billion and operating company net cash of $1.7 billion, a $6.4 billion improvement over this period last year. Looking forward to Q2, the market and competitive environment continues to be challenging. While there are signs of recovery in some geographic regions, many areas across the globe are soft. Currency impacts are also affecting the global business environment, and we expect currency to be about a 1 point headwind year-over-year to revenue in Q2. By business, in Printing, we will continue to invest in hardware unit placements where the lifetime return on the unit makes economic sense, and we expect to drive continued momentum in key strategies across ink, laser and graphics. For Personal Systems, while we expect the commercial segment to continue to outpace the consumer segment, we believe the overall market is likely to remain highly competitive. In Enterprise Group, we remain focused on more successfully managing the margin profile, and we expect continued traction in Networking, Converged Infrastructure and Converged Storage. In Enterprise Services, we expect the delayed key account runoff to continue to pressure growth and profitability, as we drive forward to transition from reactive to proactive sales. Finally, in Software, we expect to see continued traction in key growth areas like Big Data, while we invest in disruptive technologies like HAVEn and security and manage our portfolio's transition to SaaS. As you build your models, please keep in mind, there was a net benefit to Q1 results from the few items I've mentioned earlier, including the IP and real estate sales, as well as litigation and other expenses. Adjusting for these items, our Q1 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share would've been around the midpoint of our previously provided Q1 outlook of $0.82 to $0.86. Also, in order to drive further operational improvements, we plan to increase our reinvestment in the business for the full year by around $0.02 per share, up from the $0.12 we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting. With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $3.60 to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q2, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share in the range of $0.85 to $0.89. From a GAAP perspective, we expect a full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $3, and GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.66. For cash flow, based on the actions we're taking to drive working capital efficiencies, we now expect moderate improvement in our cash conversion cycle from the low 20-day range we estimated previously. We expect this to provide some upside to our original cash flow outlook for the year. And with that, I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, as you noted, you continue to beat the cash cycle target of 20 to 21 days. So can you just give us a little more detailed view as to what's the right, realistic, near-term cash cycle target is? And then assuming you still think that the company will drift back to the 20- to 21-day range, are there offsets to that longer-term opportunities in CapEx or cash tax payments or other items, such that you can offset an increasing cash cycle longer term?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Katy. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect a moderate improvement on -- in the cash conversion cycle off of the guidance that we previously provided around the low 20s, and we're very pleased with the progress that we made in Q1, to drive 16 days on cash conversion cycle, which is, just so everyone thinks through this, is actually down a day sequentially and normal sequential performance is up anywhere from a couple of days to 3 days. Now we did have some help in that, in the sense that we had some nice favorable revenue linearity, and we also benefited from the IP sale, as well as the mix of PCs. Because if you'll recall, the PC cash conversion cycle is negative. And so as the PSG business increases its relative mix, it puts some nice downward pressure on the cash conversion cycle. Over the longer term, though, we do expect that, that mix from PSG will in fact decrease on a relative basis. And so that will put some upward pressure on the cash conversion cycle. So we do, as I say, overall expect moderate improvements off of the low 20s that we provided before. We are also very much focused on our capital expenditures and making sure that we are spending everything that we need to spend, but nothing more, and everything that we spend is driving the appropriate return. And we'll continue to be focused on that.
Margaret Whitman: And Katy, I'd just add one more thing. It's Meg. The next chapter in improving our cash generation capability is around SKUs and platform rationalization. Because if you think about it, the more SKUs and the more platforms you have, the more inventory you have, the more parts you have, and the chances that you have the right inventory in the right place at the right time decrease. So there's more leverage over the long term, not necessarily in 2014, but there's more leverage in the long term around making sure we have the right product for the right market segment and don't over-SKU.
Operator: We have Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and a follow-up, please. Cathie, I was hoping that you could just provide a little bit more detail on the sale of the mobile computing IP that you alluded to, as well as the real estate sale. I think you also mentioned in your summary remarks that there had been some litigation as well, which was a benefit. So perhaps you could just dimension the size of each of those. And are they all captured in your Corporate Investments reporting segment or are they somewhere else in your segment reporting? And then I have a follow-up.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. Toni, thanks for the question. So I think what's important to understand is that a number of these items are what I would consider normal operating transactions for the business. Now what's different in this quarter and the reason why we're calling them out is that they're larger than they typically are in a quarter. And so, we think it's important to provide that kind of color. And what it is, is that we've got sales of IP that the vast majority of those sales do show up in the Corporate Investments segment, but there is a small piece of that shows up in PSG as well. And then we've got gains on sales of real estate, partially offset by increased litigation expenses, as well as some other smaller items.
Margaret Whitman: So Toni, the litigation expense was not a good thing. It was a negative.
Catherine Lesjak: That's right. It offset the gains from the sale of IP and real estate.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. But -- and where are those occurring? Are those also being captured in the Corporate Investments line or are they somewhere else in the reported segments?
Catherine Lesjak: Right. So the increase in litigation expenses shows up in the Corporate -- other Corporate Investments segment to a large extent that there is a small piece that is also showing up in the Enterprise Services Group.
Toni Sacconaghi: And the real estate gain?
Catherine Lesjak: Real estate gain shows up in the Corporate Investments or Corporate Other segment as well.
Toni Sacconaghi: And then if I could just follow up on the Services side, you talked about some -- it was largely in line with your expectations for Q1, but you expected the drag to continue. Are you still confident in your full year outlook of 3.5% to 4.5% operating margin for that business and a 4% to 6% decline in revenues for that business for this year? Or are you recalibrating it in light of weak signings and other issues?
Catherine Lesjak: So we are not recalibrating. We still expect 3.5% to 4.5% from an operating margin perspective and the 4% to 6% decline in revenue.
Operator: Jim Suva with Citi.
Jim Suva: You've done a lot of work and it's really showing, which is fabulous. Of course, there's always areas for improvement, and one area for improvement is, I think, the operating margins or profitability within your Services segment. Can you talk a little bit about that? I mean, year-over-year, you definitely have some trailing off of revenues, which we understand. But given all the restructuring HP has been doing, it's kind of a bit surprising to see that year-over-year, operating margins in that segment actually declined year-over-year. We understand the seasonal nature but the year-over-year decline, and it sounds like you're sticking to your goal of it. Is it just truly you're investing a lot more, and at some point, you foresee turning the corner to positive sales growth in that area? And would that be this year? Or help us understand how to bridge the gap of the restructuring with the year-over-year operating profit decline.
Margaret Whitman: So we are at the beginning of, as I said, a multi-year turnaround in our Enterprise Services business. And this is -- has -- unlike our PC business or even our Industry Standard Servers businesses, this has nothing to do with the transactional business. These are long-term contracts, and so it takes a little bit longer to turn this ship around. And we've got work to do on labor, not only the number of delivery centers or labor pyramid, and we have more work to do in terms of our labor force in Europe and that is well under way. We also are doing a lot of investments in our systems and technology. This business really didn't have the visibility and the instrumentation that we needed to run a very labor-intensive business. We've made those investments, and they're starting to bear fruit. And I think you'll see those bear fruit through the rest of the year. And then ultimately, we have to turn the revenue corner here. We had, as we said for a couple of years now, key account runoff, and we've got to turn the revenue trajectory. And we've restructured our sales organization. We've got 7 new practice areas that are designed to meet the needs, very specifically, of customers, what they want from our Services business. So over the long term, we're optimistic. This is playing out in 2014 almost exactly, I think, the way Cathie and I thought it would. Do you want to add anything to that?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes. And maybe I can provide just a little bit more specifics on the decline year-over-year in the operating margin. What we saw was progress on productivity initiatives, as well as improvements in some of our underperforming accounts on a year-over-year basis. Now this was offset by the fact that this key account runoff is higher-margin runoff. We continue to have contractual price concessions that we have to make on certain contracts, and then we did increase our investment in some of our OpEx items.
Operator: We have Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: I wanted to ask about Enterprise Group and PCs. On Enterprise Group, revenues were up 1% and ISS actually had another good quarter. And the question is, Meg or Cathie, as you look at 2014, is a positive revenue number sustainable for this division? And the corollary question is, on the PC side, you mentioned you feel better about corporates. And what's your confidence level on that, in terms of sustainability? Because it sounds like there is some pull-in for XP. But just -- when you talk about you feel like corporate is better -- corporate buying is better, is that sustainable through the year? Or does that fall off here as Microsoft goes through its transition?
Margaret Whitman: Sure, let me take a crack at that. It's Meg, and then I'll get Cathie to weigh in. On the Enterprise Group side, we do think revenue growth is possible through the remainder of the year. We saw good traction in ISS. Listen, we still have a BCS drag on the portfolio, and that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. We're optimistic about Storage, particularly 3PAR, and Networking got off to a good start. So we've got to continue to execute. We've got to get our sales motion exactly right, and we have to get our innovation into the market and sold in a way that customers can understand and appreciate. So I think -- feel good about Enterprise Group. PSG, I think what most people will be surprised about in this earnings call is how well PSG did. And I'd do a shout-out to Dion Weisler and his team as they continue to execute. Our multi-OS, multi-architectural, multi-form factor strategy is working well. Market segmentation and leveraging our strengths in commercial and go-to-market capability is working well. And there was a bit of a tailwind on the migration from XP to Windows, but I wouldn't say that was an overwhelming factor. It was important but not overwhelming. I do think there's also some momentum in the long term, a long overdue PC refresh. And what I think commercial customers are understanding from their employees is while employees may want a tablet, they actually also need more traditional compute devices to do their real work in the everyday environment in their company.
Keith Bachman: So Meg, could this be a positive number for the year too, as you think about PSG?
Margaret Whitman: Hard to call it. This is a pretty -- this has been, over the last 2 years, a pretty volatile market. My experience over many years in business is you always underestimate on the way down or you underestimate on the way down about how bad it's going to be. And then you -- on the way up, sometimes it's better than you think it's going to be. But I think it's too early to call. I think we should be relatively cautious here, given the volatile nature of the business.
Catherine Lesjak: I think it's what's important -- it's -- what's really important with respect to the PC business is that we've got to focus on profitable growth. And if that means that there is less top line growth, that's okay because we're focused on profitable growth.
Operator: We have Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz: Two questions, if I could. With the Storage business continuing to improve, are you starting to see some cross-pollination or cross-selling as a result of that pull into your Networking or other parts of your business? And then a second question is more philosophically, Meg, with the continued improvement in the balance sheet, the business model, cash flow, is there any change there in terms of organic versus inorganic investment? Could you start to maybe look outside to make some acquisitions, maybe bolt-on acquisitions first before you get a little more courageous?
Margaret Whitman: Okay, let me start with Storage. Listen, we're making a big push towards Converged Infrastructure. We rolled out new Converged Infrastructure offerings, which we call Sharks, at Discover in Barcelona. It's a perfect channel product, easy to sell, very specifically focused on certain workloads. And so we're bullish on Storage, and we think that as we embed Storage into Converged Infrastructure, that there is some pull-through. At least, that's the bet we're making. With regard to acquisitions, we stand by where we were at our industry -- our Security Analyst Meeting last October that we will return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in terms of repurchase of shares and dividends. But I do think we will be now considering acquisitions. As this market changes very dramatically, you can see that we may need acquisitions in security, Big Data, mobility and cloud. We will be very judicious. It will be returns based, and I'd say it'd be small to medium-sized acquisitions. So that's where we're headed. But the capital allocation strategy that we laid out at SAM, exactly the same.
Operator: Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Can you talk about Services just a little more, the 1% operating margin, then you got to get to 3.5% to 4.5% for the year? So how do you get there? It sounds like you kept all your targets. So how do we improve as we go throughout each quarter? And what are you working on specifically to get there?
Margaret Whitman: So Ben, one of the things to -- if you go back to some of the commentary in the first half of last year, you'll recall that we talked about the delayed key account runoff, but you might also recall that we talked about the fact that we were selling more project-based business into those accounts to help them make the transitions that they were focused on. And that increased profitability and revenue, but increased profitability in the first half of the year. And so we are now working through that. Because now that account runoff is, in fact, coming through and the project to up-sell is not happening in those accounts. And so we expected that the first half of the year would always be under more pressure and that we would see more of an uptick -- we'll see an uptick quarter-to-quarter but more of an uptick in the second half versus the first half. We are also making this pivot. We're making investments into our sales force to move from less reactive renewal base to more proactive sales, and that starts to have a bit more of a help in the second half of the year.
Benjamin Reitzes: Okay. And obviously, more leverage from the restructuring, I assume.
Margaret Whitman: Absolutely. We're continuing to restructure as well. And actually, at the total company level, we had another roughly 3,700 employees that leave -- that left under the program. And so now we're running program today, that's 28,300.
Operator: Aaron Rakers with Stifel.
Aaron Rakers: I want to go back and build on Keith's questions with regards to the Enterprise Group. Understanding the revenue growth and possibly the expectation that, that can be sustained throughout this year, how are we thinking about, particularly the hardware operating margin trend? It looks like, given your commentary with Technology Services operating margin improving, it looks like we're still seeing a bit of a deceleration in the traditional hardware operating margin. So is that really product cycle driven? I think last quarter, you also had implemented some go-to-market strategies. So any update there would be helpful.
Margaret Whitman: Well, let me weigh in, and then I'll let Cathie chime in as well. Listen, we are turning the Enterprise Group around, and you can see it in the revenues and the success in ISS revenues, as well as Networking and Storage. We still got more do -- more work to do on the margin. And the margin, Aaron, can improve in 2 ways. One is within the product line because we decide what deals we're going to go after and with what product, we manage our cost structure aggressively. But there's also a mixed thing going on here as well because every time we sell storage and networking, that is margin-accretive to HP versus our classic ISS business. So those are the 2 levers that we have to pull, and I think we have not demonstrated yet our best efforts in doing this. We're -- these things take a while to turn but we're on it. We've got the right people on it, and I think you'll see margin improvement over the course of the year if we can -- if the market holds up and we can continue to execute.
Catherine Lesjak: And I'd add maybe a couple more points. First, it's not just Storage and Networking, although that is a big piece of the mix. It's also our new products. Our new products have better margins as well. And then just as you think about kind of the profitability of EG for the year and you go back to what we said at the Security Analyst Meeting where we said that EG's contribution to the year-over-year improvement in EPS at the company level would be anywhere from $0.01 dilutive to a couple cents accretive, and this was before the basically $0.12 at that time that we were investing back into the business and now we're adding an additional $0.02. And so we still believe that, that's what the result will be in EG.
Operator: Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: If I could go back to the cash flow, Cathie, you mentioned that the cash conversion cycle should be moderately better than you expected. I think everyday improvement is a few hundred million dollars a quarter in cash flow. So is your operating cash flow target for the year rising by $1 billion to $2 billion? Or are there offsets to that? I didn't hear a specific number relative to your original goal of 9 to 9.5, so I was just hoping you could be a little bit more specific.
Catherine Lesjak: So I didn't provide a very specific number because we don't typically update our cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis. But you should read through that if the cash conversion cycle is moderately better than the low 20s, we're not seeing the same level of degradation in the cash conversion cycle in '14 as we had originally expected that, that would give us a bit of an uplift to the cash flow for the year.
Margaret Whitman: And I think if I heard you right, Brian, you said that the cash flow guidance had been 9 to 9.5? It's actually 6 to 6.5.
Catherine Lesjak: That's free cash flow.
Margaret Whitman: Oh, okay.
Catherine Lesjak: He was talking about cash flow from ops.
Margaret Whitman: Okay, okay. But there should be a bit of upside to both of them.
Operator: Steve Milunovich with UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Obviously, your execution is much better. But Meg, you talked about better repositioning of the company, kind of relative to your competitors. And I'm just going to challenge you a little bit on that. IBM, obviously, is getting out of servers, you've kind of alluded to that, out of x86 servers. But that's because they see it as a very low-margin business. Your software exposure is still quite low relative to your competitors. And you've actually become somewhat more dependent on Printing over the last 12 to 18 months. So I know I'm picking on the negatives, but can you talk about what you mean by improved repositioning, particularly from a competitive standpoint?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, sure. So 2.5 years ago, we embarked on some pretty significant changes to this company around the cost structure, around our pivot to the New Style of IT, around investment in innovation. We totally understood what was happening in this market 2 years ago, and we began to take actions. And I think what you see is our competitors now having to take some of those same actions around cost reduction. You're starting to see some weakness in their results, which we saw 2.5 years ago. So my point is that I think we've been hard at work on doing a lot of things that are going to position us, as this industry continues to go through some very challenging changes. I mean, the pace of change and the magnitude of the change here is as great as I've seen in my career, and I think we're reasonably well positioned to take advantage of those changes. We have businesses that are declining businesses. We understand where they are. We understand what we need to do with them. We've got businesses that are holding in terms of revenue and then we've got growth businesses. And we have pivoted investment. We've pivoted people. We've pivoted go-to-market to those growth areas of the company. And by the way, it started 2 years ago. So I just would say we have a running start. We'd never underestimate the competition. But I think because we were in such a tough situation 2.5 years ago, we got a head start.
Steven Milunovich: That's fair. And what are you hearing from your customers? Are they, in fact, making architectural decisions that are deferring some of their purchases right now or not?
Margaret Whitman: So I'd say I'm hearing 2 things from our customers. One is tremendous increase in confidence in HP. We look like the paragon of stability right now, which is very different than it was 2 years ago. And they have a lot of confidence in where we're headed from a product roadmap perspective. They are making decisions -- architectural decisions. We don't see them holding off on that. There's movement around cloud. There's movement around which -- are they going to make a bet on HP's hybrid cloud? Are they going to make a bet on someone else's cloud? So there is a battle going on for architectural control in the enterprise, and we feel good about where we are in that. It's early stages. There's still a lot of proof of concept. There's still a lot of trying to decide what workloads people want to move to the cloud, what kind of cloud they want to move those workloads to. But I would say, particularly within cloud and then Big Data, we've got a very compelling offering. This hybrid cloud offering that we crafted well over 1.5 year ago, it's the right answer. I can tell you every single day, customers say this is exactly what I want. And then in Big Data, the response to HAVEn is tremendous because everyone's looking for a Big Data analytics platform that is based on Hadoop, that can combine structured data plus unstructured data with enterprise-grade security, with the ability for them to write apps, us to write apps and the ecosystem to write apps. And so, the response to that is another really, really good thing in the marketplace. So it's a battle. It's a knife fight every single day out there, but we feel like we've got the right ammunition.
Operator: Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the toner business? Specifically, you talked about, I guess, year-over-year declines in terms of revenue this quarter. How you think that plays out through the year? And you noted, I think, the channel inventory is up a little bit. Just any color you can give, and then I have a follow-up.
Margaret Whitman: Sure. Thanks, Shannon. So what we're seeing on the toner side is definitely softness. And just to be clear, on the ink side, we saw growth in ink supplies. And it was really toner that took supplies down, the 2.5% that we saw. As -- and that was also -- currency also contributed to that. But I would say that the toner softness was due to 2 big things. One is we're seeing incrementally much more aggressive price competition from some of the Japanese competitors who, of course, have the benefit of the weaker yen. And then we are starting to see increasing competition from clones and remanufacturers as well.
Shannon Cross: Okay, great. And then, can you -- oh, sorry.
Margaret Whitman: I'm sorry, I'm just going to say, the other thing is we've got to continue to place laser units with positive lifetime value. And we've -- I think what we said, the third consecutive quarter of incremental placement in laser, our portfolio of multi-function colored printers is actually now hitting its real stride. We just introduced many of them at the end of last year or even the beginning of this year. We're gaining share in a category that HP had been underrepresented. But if we were underrepresented in that market share, it means we didn't have the toner trailing that market share. Now we have a product, and so the units we're placing today pay dividends next year and the year after. And so, I think you should feel good about the share gains we're making. And then lastly is the Managed Print Services. This is where -- the benefit of Managed Print Services is we get 100% of the aftermarket. And so, that's an important thing as well. And what, 4 or 5 years ago, Cathie, we didn't really even have a business there. And now, that's a successful business for us and we're growing it.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, and our TCV in that business this quarter was up strong double digits, so continuing to make good progress in Managed Print Services.
Shannon Cross: Okay, great. And then if you can just talk a little bit about the Server business? And specifically, I'm curious as to what you're seeing in terms of the IBM sales. Any opportunities that could gain share there and how you're looking at targeting some of that business?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So as everyone on the call knows, Lenovo announced they're buying IBM's x86 server business from top to bottom. And that good news is it does create, I think, an opportunity for us. Because what I have learned about this business is instability and for the questions about the future, make it very difficult because people want to bet on the roadmap, and they're worried that, as a change of ownership occurs, is the roadmap the same? Is the investment the same? Is the go-to-market going to be the same? Is the service going to be the same? So I think we have a near-term opportunity here to gain share in our Enterprise Services or in our Server business. So we're all over it. We're all over it with our channel partners, and I think there's a good near-term opportunity. In the long term, obviously, Lenovo's going to be a powerful competitor, and we aim to be well set up by the time the deal is done to compete really aggressively.
Operator: Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Can you give us a bit more color on the traction you're seeing with the new portfolio offerings for the Technology Services business? And I guess, over time, how should we think about when an increased attach rate here can fully counter some of the hardware installed base erosion you mentioned, given that's somewhat of a moving target?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. I -- there's a couple of things going on here. First of all, part of the decrease is that we have taken a grow only profitable revenue in Technology Services Consulting. This was a business a couple of years ago that was actually not very profitable or maybe even losing money. So part of the decline is a conscious decision to be in the consulting business only that makes money. But you're right. There was a very high attach rate to BCS, and if BCS declines, you're going to see some natural degradation. I think the TS team deserves a huge amount of credit for product innovation that has mitigated that decline. Proactive data center care is -- the bookings, Cathie, right, are in triple digits. I mean, this a very well-received product in the marketplace, and then Flexible Capacity Services, which really capitalizes on the trend of Infrastructure-as-a-Service. So what Flexible Capacity Services is, is we can roll in a unit of compute into a customer's data center. They control it. It's on premise, and yet they can pay for it on a, if you will, as a service basis. There's a minimum that they have to consume. There's obviously a maximum unit of compute can deliver, but they have ability to flex up and down. And it turns out, that actually works for us economically because of HP Financial Services. So we don't have a balance sheet problem that you might imagine on an as-a-service infrastructure of product. So we're excited about both of those. There's a big pipeline. This product, by the way, Flexibile Capacity Services, was pioneered in Europe. We've got a big pipeline there and Proactive data center care, off to a really, really strong start. And so, shout-out to the team because they've really -- they saw what was happening and they responded with product, which is what HP has to do. We have to keep innovating because as some businesses start to fall away, we need to have new businesses that can take their place with higher margins.
Catherine Lesjak: I think it's also important in the TS business to understand that roughly half of the decline is as a result of currency. And if you actually had modeled what the decline in hardware over the last year would do to support, it would be materially more than what we're seeing. And that's the result of all these new product innovations that Meg was talking about. Specifically, in terms of penetration rates, we are seeing growth in both Storage and Networking penetration rates and that is going to help offset some of the pressure that we're seeing from BCS declines.
Operator: We have Maynard Um with Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: Meg, so you've been in CEO position now, I think, for 3.5 years, presumably of a better feel for areas that are non-core. So I'm wondering if we might see more divestitures coming this year. And then I was also hoping if you could just elaborate on the account runoffs and, in particular, the Navy contract, which was extended from June to September. So I'm just wondering what the dynamics there are and if that helps this fiscal year in terms of the revenues and the profits for the Services segment.
Margaret Whitman: Sure. So actually, I've been here 2.5 years. Sometimes it feels like 3.5, but I've been here 2.5. And obviously, I have a much better feel of the product portfolio and the capabilities of the organization. And now, we're in the position of really looking at the portfolio within the portfolio within the portfolio. Right now, I don't see a major move of the big 4 businesses, but this is a vast portfolio and there are product lines and smaller businesses within these big operating divisions that could be candidates for divestiture. We haven't made any decisions, but we are now getting to the natural course of, okay, do we have the optimized portfolio? With regard to the Navy contract, this was actually not really a key account runoff because the Navy contract was rebid and we won for 10 years. So we're excited about that contract. It was a lower-margin contract, as you might imagine, but we are in a very good position with the Navy. But there was profit pressure from a decreased profitability as we rebid that Navy contract. But it's not a runoff. It's just another 10 years at slightly lower margins.
Rob Binns: Super. All right. Thanks very much and that concludes the questions. And with that, we'll wrap up the call. So thank you, everybody, for participating and we'll talk soon. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the final quarter of our fix-and-rebuild year now behind us, I'm pleased with our progress in fiscal 2013. As we said when we laid out our 5-year plan, we expected that our turnaround would not be linear, and we saw that during the year. However, as I reflect on the key priorities we outlined at the beginning of 2013: driving innovation across HP, improving operations, aligning our cost structure and rebuilding our balance sheet, we made great progress. We also saw some positive momentum in our execution, leading to pockets of revenue growth in key areas in Q4. The fourth quarter capped a year of significant innovation at HP. We launched OneView, a revolutionary, consumer-inspired infrastructure management platform that allows customers to dramatically improve data center operations while reducing cost. We introduced the new StoreVirtual storage appliance, bundled with our industry-leading ProLiant servers, underscoring our leadership in the software-defined storage market. We also launched version 7 of the HP Vertica Analytics Platform, which dramatically simplifies analysis of semistructured data. And just last week, we announced a partnership with Salesforce.com to create the HP-Salesforce Superpod, a dedicated instance of Salesforce running exclusively on HP's Converged Infrastructure. In addition to the product innovation happening across HP, we are driving significant business model innovation as well. In printing, we are seeing success with our Ink Advantage program and our newly launched Instant Ink offering. In Software-defined Networking, we launched a new App Store that, coupled with our network developer kit, will create the industry's first enterprise-class open ecosystem. As you all know, in fiscal 2013, we focused on improving our operations, driving better cash flow and rebuilding our balance sheet. These foundational improvements were critical early steps in our turnaround and I'm extremely proud of the results we've delivered in this area. In Q4, we brought our cash conversion cycle down to 17 days and delivered free cash flow of $2 billion. For the full year, we delivered more than $9 billion of free cash flow, well above our most recent outlook of about $8 billion. We reduced operating company net debt by more than $1 billion for the seventh consecutive quarter and, as a result, we achieved our operating company net debt goals ahead of plan. We also ramped back up our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter and returned a combined $763 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. More importantly, we once again achieved the non-GAAP diluted earnings per share we said we would, delivering $1.01 in the fourth quarter and $3.56 for fiscal 2013, at the high end of our most recently provided outlook. Looking forward, we will stay committed to smart capital allocation and profitable growth. As we said at our security analyst meeting last month, we believe we can grow both margin and share over the longer term. We'll continue to be aggressive in targeted cases, but we have more opportunity to improve our profitability. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q4 were driven by strong performance in Printing, revenue growth in the Enterprise Group, improved revenue performance in Personal Systems, plus continued execution in Software and Enterprise Services. Our Printing business delivered an excellent quarter with continued strong profitability. We outperformed the market for the second successive quarter, gaining 4 points of total unit market share over the prior year. Revenue for the quarter was down 1%, but we saw growth of 1% in constant currency. For the second consecutive quarter, we grew unit placement, which was up 6% over the prior year, driven by strength in laser volume and our SMB home business. Our Managed Print Services business also had a good quarter with double-digit TCV growth driven by our partner program. In Personal Systems, we outperformed the market, with particular strength in our commercial PC business. Revenue for the quarter was down 2% over the prior year but flat in constant currency against the backdrop of a market declining 9.5% in units in the third calendar quarter. Overall, we gained 1.8 points of share over the prior year and 1.2 points sequentially. As a result, we improved our share position in all 3 regions. In the fourth fiscal quarter, HP saw its first unit growth since the first calendar quarter of 2012, even as the market saw a continued decline in units. Our commercial PC business grew revenue 4% over the prior year, driven by commercial notebooks, with our EliteBook Folio doing particularly well. The Personal Systems team did a good job managing the DRAM challenges in the quarter, but we expect upward cost pressure will create a headwind in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We continue to manage the end-to-end cost structure of our Personal Systems business with profitability very much in mind. In Enterprise Services, the business is now more predictable as we continue to execute well against our recovery plans. ES revenue was down 9% for the quarter and down 8% for the full year, well within our previously provided outlook range. Operating margin in the fourth quarter was 4.4%, resulting in operating margin of 2.9% for fiscal 2013, at the high end of the target range for the year. In Q4, bookings were up over 30% over the prior year, driven by strong renewals. At the end of fiscal 2013, trailing 12-month book-to-bill was approximately 1, in line with our guidance at last year's security analyst meeting. Looking to fiscal 2014, we are focused on the Salesforce retooling program that we outlined at our security analyst meeting. We will continue our relentless attention to cost and productivity as the delayed revenue run-off puts further pressure on our fiscal 2014 services revenue. In the Enterprise Group, we saw revenue growth of 2%, the first time we have grown revenue in 8 quarters. We saw improved sales execution, a strong Hyperscale quarter and stabilization in blades, complemented by revenue growth in networking and storage. Overall, margins were pressured by a competitive price environment and an unfavorable mix. Looking forward, we are focused on improving our channel performance, driving cost savings to improve operating margins and bringing new innovations to market in Converged Infrastructure. As we discussed last quarter, we made significant leadership changes in the Enterprise Group. Bill Veghte and his leadership team have hit the ground running, and the early signs are encouraging. In addition, last week we announced that Martin Fink will assume responsibility for leading the HP cloud business as its General Manager. This is in addition to his role as HP's CTO and Director of HP Labs. Martin is a true technology visionary who brings tremendous understanding of the enterprise hardware and software space, extensive experience in platform development, and he literally wrote the book on open source. We believe Martin will help significantly accelerate our cloud business. In servers, we saw very strong growth in Hyperscale over the prior year, driven by several key wins, although this did put pressure on our margins in the quarter. Our blades business recovered as the benefits of our targeted segmentation and efforts to improve operational excellence paid off. We expect to gain over 1 point of share here and extend the market leadership position we have already held for 27 quarters. We saw improved sales in our mainstream server business, but we need to improve our pricing discipline and profitability. Although revenue continued to decline in Business Critical Systems, we expect to hold or gain share in calendar Q3, and we have announced plans to bring 100% fault tolerant HP NonStop platform to the x86 architecture. In storage, I'm very pleased with our progress. Total storage product revenue grew 1% year-over-year with good sequential growth. We saw another record 3PAR quarter and are very encouraged by the strong customer acceptance we're seeing. As a result, Converged Storage product revenue grew 47% over the prior year. Revenue declines moderated in traditional storage, driven by higher storage networking attach and sales of our recently refreshed entry products. With these results, we expect to once again gain share in the combined high end and midrange markets. In HP Networking, we saw 3% growth driven by strong performance in China, as well as growth in EMEA. We are also encouraged by our growth momentum in wireless LAN, and we will continue to focus on driving innovation in Software-defined Networking. In Technology Services, revenue was down, driven by lower hardware sales in prior quarters, particularly in BCS. However, I'm encouraged by the positive traction in new portfolio offerings, like flexible capacity services and proactive care, new services that give customers cost-effective flexibility in their data center while ensuring they can manage spikes in demand. In Software, disciplined cost management resulted in operating profit of 30.8% for the quarter. Revenue decreased 9% over the prior year, although we had a tough compare due to a large General Motors deal last year. However, the Software team did grow in a number of areas, including good growth in cloud and automation and SaaS bookings; double-digit growth in security, after normalizing for the impact of the General Motors deal; and in Autonomy, we continue to make progress and saw the second successive quarter of sequential license revenue growth. Now let me turn to our future outlook. Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we have made, but we still have a lot of work to do to drive consistent execution and navigate a rapidly shifting marketplace. As we enter the third year of our turnaround, we will continue to execute against the improvement areas we outlined at our security analyst meeting last month, including increasing our commitment to research and development. This work broadly falls into 3 buckets. The first is the shifting market forces. As an example, in Personal Systems, we are making progress on our mobility strategy, but we still have not broken through. Similarly, we are still in the early stages of building an ecosystem to capture a greater share of personal device, accessories and services. Second is the changing competitive landscape. We need to keep the customer at the center of what we do and deliver comprehensive and innovative solutions as our competitors look to expand across the IT stack. And finally, the third bucket is our own ability to execute. At our security analyst meeting, we highlighted a number of areas where we need to execute better. For example, we need to do more work to fix our go-to-market strategy in Enterprise Group, particularly in channel engagement and pricing. On cost management, we are optimizing our service delivery in Enterprise Services. And as we reinvigorate our core software business, we must ensure we have the right back office systems and operational excellence to support this effort. As a result of both the challenges and the progress we're making, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share will be $0.82 to $0.86 and our full year outlook is $3.55 to $3.75. Now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we generated revenue of $29.1 billion, down 3% year-over-year and down only 1% in constant currency. Total FY '13 revenue was $112.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year, or down 5% in constant currency. We saw year-over-year revenue growth this quarter in Industry Standard Servers, Networking, Storage and constant currency revenue growth in Printing. Personal Systems' performance was better than expected, and sales outpaced the market. Enterprise Services was broadly in line, and Software had a tough year-over-year compare but continued to drive growth in key areas while expanding operating profit. On a regional basis, Americas fourth quarter revenue was $13.3 billion, down 2% year-over-year, or down 1% in constant currency. U.S. revenue was down slightly, with declines also in Brazil and Canada, and Americas' full year revenue declined 6%. EMEA fourth quarter revenue of $10.3 billion was down 4% year-over-year, or down 5% in constant currency. The Q4 EMEA environment remained tough, although sales declined less year-over-year than in Q3, and we saw growth in Germany and other pockets of Western Europe. Full year EMEA revenue declined 9%. APJ fourth quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, down 1% year-over-year but up 4% in constant currency. In Q4, we saw strong growth in India, mostly due to our recent educational PC win in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This offset weaker China performance across many of our businesses, although Networking continued to perform well in China. APJ full year revenue declined 5%. Overall, we're pleased with our fourth quarter results. Revenue declines moderated, demonstrating the quality and the competitiveness of our portfolio. At the same time, we recognize we have more work to do on continuing to align our cost structure to support profitable long-term growth. Our Q4 gross margin was 23%, down 1.2 points year-over-year and down 0.4 points sequentially. The year-over-year decline was mostly driven by a competitive pricing environment and an unfavorable mix across the Enterprise Group, particularly in ISS. Sequentially, the competitive dynamics in the Enterprise Group and Personal Systems were mostly offset by the seasonal uptick in Enterprise Services and an improvement in Printing. Our full year gross margin was 23.1%, down 0.2 points year-over-year as the competitive pricing pressures in EG and Personal Systems were partially offset by margin improvement in Printing. Savings from our restructuring program in Enterprise Services and Technology Services were offset by revenue declines in those businesses. In the fourth quarter, we had non-GAAP operating expenses of $4.1 billion, down 1.4% year-over-year and up 0.2% sequentially. R&D is down due to the streamline operations across the Enterprise Group and lower R&D expenses specifically within BCS. Long term, we remain focused on investing in innovation across the organization, and in fact, we've added headcount in engineering in FY '13. SG&A is up around 3.8% year-over-year, although that largely reflects the impact of our real estate gain in the prior year quarter. We also made investments to improve operational efficiency, which are already driving significantly shorter quote turnaround time and improved win rates. Total non-GAAP operating expenses in fiscal 2013 were $16.4 billion, down 2.9% year-over-year. This reduction was mostly due to savings from our labor restructuring initiative and our ongoing efforts to better align costs with revenue. For the year, across cost of sales and OpEx, we saw labor savings of approximately $2 billion, slightly below the range we estimated for you at the beginning of the year. But total savings, including non-labor, were in line with expectations. We are continuing to look for further cost savings and while we are still in the early stages, we believe there may be incremental opportunity. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating profit was $2.6 billion, down 16% year-over-year but up sequentially 14%. We recorded $103 million of expense on the other income and expense line, a decline from the prior year due in part to currency gains in the quarter. With a 22% tax rate and a share count of 1.94 billion shares outstanding, we delivered fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.01. Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings exclude pretax charges of $371 million for restructuring and $317 million for amortization of intangible assets. For the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $3.56, which is at the high end of the $3.40 to $3.60 outlook we've provided at our security analyst meeting in 2012. Full year non-GAAP earnings exclude pretax charges of $1.4 billion for amortization of intangible assets, $1 billion for restructuring and $22 million of acquisition-related charges. Turning to the business units. We're very pleased with the fourth quarter performance in Printing. The initiatives we've begun executing to increase Printing relevance, drive high-usage units and improve unit shares are paying off. Q4 revenue of $6 billion was down 1% year-over-year but up 1% in constant currency as hardware unit growth offset declines in supplies. Total unit shipments grew 6% over last year, and this was the second quarter in a row of year-over-year unit growth. And as Meg said, we continue to gain share. We are seeing great results with Ink in the Office, which helped drive Q4 SMB hardware sales up double digits, and Ink Advantage had strong performance across all regions. In the laser market, in calendar Q3, HP grew at over twice the rate of the rest of the market, and graphics revenue grew to a record level in Q4. Within graphics, Digital Press, which includes Indigo, saw double-digit growth. Printing operating profit was $1.1 billion, or 17.7% of revenue, up 0.2 points from the prior year period. A favorable yen impact and operational improvements were mostly offset by lower supplies mix. Commercial hardware revenue grew 5% year-over-year while units grew 9%, driven by strength in transaction laser, managed print services and graphics. Consumer hardware revenue grew 7% while units grew 4% year-over-year in Q4. OfficeJet Pro X, a great example of our recent innovations, is seeing strong customer traction. Supplies revenue declined 4% from the prior year period and made up 63.9% of Printing revenue. Supplies declined only 0.5% on a constant currency basis. The team executed well in the quarter and supplies channel inventory levels are back down within our targeted range. Personal Systems performed better than expected in the quarter, driven by commercial sales and supported by the India PC deal I mentioned earlier. Fourth quarter revenue was $8.6 billion, down just 2% over prior year and almost flat in constant currency, reflecting the good progress Dion is making. Total unit shipments grew 2% year-over-year in Q4, with growth in both consumer and commercial. Consumer sales declined 10% year-over-year but grew 19% sequentially, while commercial revenue grew 4% over prior year and 8% sequentially. Personal Systems operating profit of $259 million, or 3% of revenue, was down 0.5 points over prior year. As we discussed in our recent analyst meeting, we remain focused on improving long-term profitability and returning this business to growth. Our channel partners are key to helping us succeed, and we continue to seek opportunities to make it easier to promote and sell HP products. For example, we are expanding our receivable programs to support the demands of our resellers and distributors. Our fourth quarter Enterprise Group results prove that we can be competitive across our portfolio, but we still have work to do so that we can continue to win deals at the right margin. EG revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $7.6 billion in Q4 with growth in Industry Standard Servers, Networking and Storage. Operating profit was $1.1 billion, or 14.5% of revenue, down 2 points from last year. We experienced competitive pricing, particularly in ISS and Networking, higher cost of service delivery in TS and an unfavorable margin mix from strong Hyperscale revenue. In general, the pricing environment remains similar to Q3, with continued aggressive pricing specifically in ISS and, to a lesser extent, in Networking. By business, Industry Standard Server revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $3.5 billion, significantly outpacing the market. We had strong sales in Hyperscale, which grew high double digits due in part to one large deal. Storage revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $952 million with very strong growth in Converged Storage, which represented 43% of total storage revenue for the quarter, up 13.5 points year-over-year. As Meg mentioned, we saw great traction with 3PAR, which grew 64% year-over-year. When you combine 3PAR, XP and EVA, you have a metric that adjusts for the planned product transition. And based on this, we outgrew the market again this quarter. Business Critical Systems' revenue declined 17% year-over-year to $334 million due to a declining UNIX market. Networking sales grew 3% year-over-year in the quarter to $656 million, led by strong growth in China and more moderate growth across the rest of APJ and EMEA. Revenue in the Americas was down year-over-year, but we are taking action to improve results by targeting areas where we can win and deliver disruptive solutions. Technology Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $2.2 billion in Q4, or 4% in constant currency. We are moving to reduce reliance on traditional hardware businesses and offer new services to address the new style of IT. The Enterprise Services business performed broadly as expected in the quarter. Revenue of $5.8 billion was down 9% year-over-year due to the account runoff we've discussed. ES operating profit of $255 million, or 4.4% of revenue, was down 2.3 points year-over-year as revenue runoff offset continued improvements in productivity and underperforming contracts. By business, IT outsourcing revenue was $3.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year primarily due to runoff pressures and we saw declines across all regions. Applications and business services revenue was $2.2 billion, down 10% year-over-year, primarily due to softness in the Applications business. Overall, we saw good momentum in signings and had strong renewal rates in our expiring contracts. Strategic Enterprise Services, which includes cloud, Big Data, application modernization and security, grew double digits. As discussed at our analyst meeting last month, we are pivoting to a more proactive sales approach and longer term, we are focused on building out our portfolio to push more aggressively with strategic Enterprise Services. Now turning to Software. Overall, Software also performed in line with expectations, with good margin performance in the quarter. Operating profit for the quarter was $328 million, or 30.8% of revenue. This was up 3.6 points year-over-year and 10.3 points sequentially, driven by great cost management and our efforts to exit low-margin professional service contracts while we continue to invest in innovation. Revenue declined 9% year-over-year to $1.1 billion on a tough year-over-year compare. You'll recall that last year, in the fourth quarter fiscal 2012, we signed a General Motors contract that is the largest customer deployment of HP Software on record. Excluding that deal, revenue declined low single digits. License revenue in the fourth quarter was down 24% year-over-year as the shift to a SaaS continues to impact us and given the large GM license deal last year. Support revenue grew 4% over the prior year and professional services revenue declined 13%. SaaS revenue was up 15% over the prior year, with higher bookings growth across all business units, particularly in Autonomy, IT management and Fortify on Demand. We have received great feedback from our customers and partners on HAVEn, our Big Data analytics platform. And going forward, we are focused on delivering new innovative solutions. Additionally, as described at our analyst meeting, we are focused on rejuvenating the IT management business and expanding Autonomy. HP Financial Services revenue in the quarter declined 6% year-over-year to $912 million. Financing volume was down 3% year-over-year with net portfolio assets of $12.2 billion. Operating profit for the business was $102 million, or 11.2% of revenue. The return on equity in HP Financial Services continued to be strong at 18.9% for the fourth quarter and 17.8% for the full year. Turning now to cash flow and capital allocation. We generated operating cash flow of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $11.6 billion for the full year. This drove Q4 free cash flow of $2 billion and fiscal 2013 free cash flow of $9.1 billion, up 21% year-over-year. Our strong cash flow performance was driven by a disciplined focus on working capital throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we were able to get the cash conversion cycle to 17 days, down 4 days year-over-year through improvements in days payable and lower inventory days. I'm pleased with the progress we've made this year, and we will continue to focus on working capital going forward. For example, we are making improvements to our payment terms with key suppliers. As we said at our analyst meeting, we believe attach conversion cycle in the low 20 days is sustainable, although we continue to look for ways to drive a better result. With this Q4 cash flow, we returned $479 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases, buying 21.5 million shares, and paid $284 million in dividends. We ended the year with gross cash of $12.5 billion and moved to an operating company net cash position of $103 million. We reduced gross debt by over $5.5 billion in fiscal '13 and have improved our net debt position by over $12 billion since the beginning of fiscal '12. We are extremely pleased with the progress we've made on our goal of rebuilding our balance sheet. In fiscal '14, we remain committed to the capital allocation priorities that we outlined at our analyst meeting in October. Looking forward to Q1, at a macro level, the environment remains challenging and somewhat choppy. EMEA continues to be soft, and China and other high-growth markets continue to face pressure. We expect currency to be about 1 point headwind year-over-year to revenue in Q1. By business, in Printing, we will continue to invest in unit placements where the lifetime return on the unit makes economic sense, and we expect to drive continued momentum in key strategies across ink, laser and graphics. For Personal Systems, we expect a greater revenue decline in Q1 than Q4, as we will not have the same big deal benefit, and expect commodity cost to pressure margins. As we focus on profitability, this cost pressure may limit revenue upside. In Enterprise Group, we expect revenue may decline from Q4 with the smaller impact from the large Hyperscale deal we mentioned. However, we expect continued traction in Converged Storage, Networking and Converged Infrastructure. In ES, we expect the delayed revenue runoff from fiscal 2013 to negatively impact Q1 growth and put pressure on first half results overall. Finally, in Software, we will accelerate our shift to SaaS and our professional services rationalization while investing in our disruptive growth opportunities like HAVEn and security. With that context, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2014 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.75. For fiscal 2014 Q1, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.82 to $0.86. From a GAAP perspective, we continue to expect a full year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.85 to $3.05 and GAAP earnings per share for fiscal Q1 is expected to be in the range of $0.60 to $0.64. We don't guide quarterly cash flow, but note that we have several factors that will significantly temper cash flow generation in the first quarter, including our annual bonus payments and accelerated restructuring payouts. With that, I'll open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: What do you attribute the improved unit performance in PCs, printers and servers, if you can just walk through those 3 segments? And more importantly, does the fiscal fourth quarter revenue performance give you any confidence that there is at least an opportunity to actually perform better on the revenue line than you had originally planned for fiscal '14?
Margaret Whitman: Katie, it's Meg. Let me take that, and I'll let Cathie chime in as well. So let me answer your last question first. I think the characterization of the business that we laid out at the security analyst meeting just 6 weeks ago remains the same. Obviously, there was real acceptance by our products and services in Q4, so we're encouraged by that, but we've got macroeconomic headwinds, I think, almost across the board. And we still have a lot of work to do in our go to market. So I think it's prudent to characterize the business the exact same way we did at the security analyst meeting. In terms of units in our Printing business, you'll recall, we have to look at the total lifetime value of a unit that we place in the market. And we, over the last couple of quarters, have been aggressive now at placing units that have a positive lifetime value, and we're going to continue to do that because that's an investment in the future of that business. In the server business, listen, we strengthened our go to market. In just the last 6 weeks of the quarter, I think we were more focused on market segmentation. We did a better job with the channel. Of course, we would have liked to see more margin drop than we did in EG. But listen, I'm encouraged by the fact that we got more aggressive, we had good quality, and I think our products were very well accepted. And I know we can do better in terms of managing the margin. We're capable of more, and we recognize that we've got more work to do. And whether that's around customer segmentation, optimizing our cost structure, more bundles to get a better blended margin, we know what to do and actually are, sort of, in progress with that as we head into Q1. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
Catherine Lesjak: I think the only thing that I would add is that in the PSG space, it was heavily skewed to commercial units, which is really where we're seeing more of the mix to shift, and that's been going on now for probably the last couple of years, but certainly, a pretty strong shift in fiscal '13, and we expect that to continue into '14. And then in IPG, it's really Ink in the Office that helped really drive unit placements. Those are good-quality units, high-usage units. Multifunction printers, the fact that we've got a pretty, almost entirely new product line up, is also helping us there. And then graphics, we had a very strong quarter in graphics, especially when you look at Indigo. And so I would say that in IPG, from a unit placement perspective, we're really hitting on almost all cylinders here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: I just wanted to talk a little bit about the margin sustainability in Printing and how it foots to your guidance for next quarter and the year. There seems like there's a major yen benefit in the quarter. And while the operating margin year-over-year was only a little better, I think it was much better than people expected. So I wanted to foot the margins in Printing to the first quarter and the year and see if you can keep up this level of outperformance and what you're going to do about pricing and hardware. Why not get more aggressive?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Ben, let me start with that. As we shared at the security analyst meeting, we are expecting a positive year from an EPS contribution perspective from IPG. As we laid out there, we expect somewhere between $0.07 and $0.11 of incremental EPS before they get their share of the $0.12 of investment. And our strategies in the segment are paying off. We're really focused on driving print relevance. We're focused on driving high-usage units, whether that's Ink in the Office, Ink Advantage for the emerging markets, ink subscription for the developed markets, and then obviously the multifunction printers and managed print services. And so we feel really good about the progress that we're making under those initiatives, and we think that, that, combined with a disciplined approach to profitability, really looking at opportunities across the portfolio where we can simplify, unify our go to market, really make sure that the contra dollars are as effective as they can be, ultimately, that allows us to then focus on the cost side as well and ultimately allows to contribute this incremental EPS of $0.07 to $0.11 on a year-over-year basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JP Morgan.
Mark Moskowitz: I wanted to touch base here on margin as well but more from an OpEx perspective at a consolidated level. SG&A seemed to be a little higher than what I expected. Is there some sort of accelerated comps that's being revived in the company model? And then R&D seemed a lot lighter than I would have thought. Is that a one-off? Or is that a sign that maybe PCs and Printing are a lot less R&D-intensive going forward and so we could see that line item in terms of R&D, that run rate start to really continue to drift lower? I'm Just trying to get a sense of how we should think about those 2 line items as we go into fiscal '14?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me address the R&D question first. So as you look at the year-over-year declines in R&D, that was really driven by 2 primary things: One is the rationalization of R&D, specifically in EG for Business Critical Systems, so that we really align the R&D investment in that space with the long-term business realities of the UNIX market. And then also, we did get some, what we call, the R&D value added tax subsidy credits that come through, and those basically offset some of the R&D expense. And when I step back and say, "Okay, what should you take away from what we're doing in R&D," the first is innovation is still at the core of Hewlett-Packard, that ultimately, and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, our number of engineers, which are at the core of what's going to drive innovation, are actually up year-over-year. And then finally, if I go back to the security analyst meeting, we expect that R&D will be up across most of our segments, major segments next year and, in total, at the HP level. So we're still very much committed to driving the right R&D at the right time in the right place. And then from an OpEx perspective, there's a little bit of volatility in the OpEx, specifically if you look in SG&A. We had, I guess you'd say, a tough compare to last year this quarter because we did have some gains from property sales that obviously don't repeat themselves or didn't repeat themselves in Q4 of this year. And then also, we are making investments for improving operational efficiency, and some of that shows up in SG&A as well, and it's showing up a little bit in obviously quicker turnaround times from a quote perspective, and that's leading to better win rates. So we believe that we're making the right set of investments in that space as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on your cost savings, mainly in terms of number of positions that have been produced. Cathie, you mentioned that there are incremental opportunities possible in cost cutting as you look into 2014. Are those in labor or non-labor? And can you give us any sense on how big they are? And then finally, on cash conversion, you're at 17 days, you think sustainable is low 20s? How -- if that's really the case, how does cash flow equal or be better than net income next year.
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, let's start with the restructuring program. Our restructuring program is really on track. At the end of fiscal '13, on a program-to-date basis, roughly 24,600 people exited under the program, so that's just under 13,000 in fiscal '13. As we talked about at the security analyst meeting, our current plan is to end at the end of '14 at the high end of our range, so 29,000 plus 15%, so somewhere between 33,000 and 34,000 people. We expect incremental labor savings in '14 of $1.1 billion. That's on top of the little bit over $2 billion that we delivered in '13. And as you mentioned and I mentioned is that we are continuing to aggressively look at whether or not there are incremental opportunities. And we've got some work still to do to really vet those, but we do think that there may well be some additional opportunities. One of the things that is a lot more difficult now than it was a year ago is that we're looking at business process reengineering and really going after cost that is what I would consider not low-hanging fruit. And so it takes us a little longer to really vet through exactly what going to look like over the course of the year. But we will update you as we finalize that. Cash conversion cycle, 17 days, very pleased with that performance, but we do still believe that the long-term sustainable is in the low 20s. So 20 to 21 days. And in terms of free cash flow, I don't have a change to the outlook that I provided for '14 at the security analyst meeting. We still expect it to be in the $6 billion to $6.5 billion range.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi.
Jim Suva: A clarification item is your outlook reiterated, which is fabulous next year for earnings, and you mentioned since your security analyst meeting in October, which was 6 weeks ago, much of it's remained the same and challenging. But as those investors and analyst take a look at it, it actually appears as if China has actually slowed a little bit more via the outlook as a result of IBM and Cisco and many other companies. But again, you're reiterating. So the question is this, is something kind of causing you to outperform a little bit stronger and offset that more challenging environment in China? Or back in October 6 weeks ago, did you already foresee what Cisco and IBM were seeing? Or simply does China just not impact you quite as much?
Margaret Whitman: So Jim, we flagged weakness in China last quarter, and China does remain soft across many of our businesses, although we saw growth in Enterprise Group led by very strong performance in Networking in China. You also probably read that we recently appointed a new executive to run China for us, a fellow by the name of Robert Mao, and he's in the newly created role of Chairman of the China region. We've actually created a fourth region, and China now reports directly to me. And I think that is going to help energize our overall efforts in China and drive a uniformed strategy and a quite differentiated approach. So listen, we have a big business in China. So if China is soft, we're going to feel the effects. But we've been flagging this for some time, and I feel like we've got the right outlook on China for 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Yes. I was curious about your improvement in storage. How much of that is related to selling storage as part of Converged Infrastructure? I'm assuming you still sell quite a bit of storage in sort of a best-of-breed mode where it might be hooked up to somebody else's server or whatever. But I think Bill had said at the analyst meeting that in general, Converged Infrastructure was something like 10% to 15% of your compute sales, if you will, and I'm just wondering how much of the storage success is because it's being sold in a single box, if you will?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks for the question. So most of the success that we're seeing in storage is in our Converged Storage solutions, but that's not -- a heavy piece of it is not from selling Converged Infrastructure. It really is a best-of-breed, and it's really in the mid-range, the 3PAR mid-range solution. And this quarter, we also saw really nice growth in the 3PAR high-end solutions as well. And you might note that at some point soon, we're going to -- our storage business, our Converged Storage solutions are actually going to cross lines and they're going to become a bigger piece of the storage business. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, as of Q4, we were at 43%. Sometime in the first half of fiscal '14, we will -- converged solutions will be more than 50% of storage, and that will allow us to continue to accelerate growth in the storage space.
Margaret Whitman: And Steve, it's Meg. With regard to Converged Infrastructure, you will recall, this our term, or definition and our vision for the market, and we are going to continue to aggressively pursue that. I think Bill was right. It's probably 10% to 15% of the total components are sold in the Converged Infrastructure format, but I think it's changing pretty fast because Converged Infrastructure is the backbone of the cloud. So we're coming to market with HP OneView, I talked about that in my opening comments which is a new management plane, that links our server storage and networking together in a very consumer-friendly way. It's almost a consumer UI designed for the enterprise. And then of course, we're working very hard on improving our bundles and our go-to-market around Converged Infrastructure. So I think actually that move in the market is going to accelerate it. We're going to actually try to drive that even harder than we have.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Could you give us a bit more color on how we should think about the steady-state for profitability versus revenue growth in the Enterprise Group, particularly in servers? Obviously, you're able to gain quite a bit of share in Industry Standard Servers this quarter, but you did have a fairly hefty margin hit year-over-year. So can you walk through whether or not we should view this as a trend over the next few quarters? Or is this more of a one-time issue given the Hyperscale performance you discussed earlier?
Margaret Whitman: So Bill, we've thought a lot about this. And in my view, market share and profitability are not mutually exclusive, as we believe we can grow both concurrently over the long term. And managed -- margins will be managed a lot more effectively, I think, by refining our customer and market segmentation to focus on those segments that we can grow profitably. We still have work to optimize our end-to-end cost structure that is all the way from design to logistics and, obviously, offering more bundled solutions. So I think, listen, we have to be very careful about transaction-only business because it's generally not sticky. So we don't want to trade profit for market share that isn't sticky over time. So listen, I think we've improved our ability to see what's actually going on to manage it, and now there's clear direction to the sales team about how we want to manage this. So my belief is that this is not a trend. We ought to be able to reverse this trend to some degree. That said, obviously, a very competitive pricing environment, but I feel good about our ability to do a better job in managing margin in ISS.
Catherine Lesjak: Let me just add that our view of margins and EPS contribution from EG has not changed since our security analyst meeting. And at that time, we talked about the fact that EG would be somewhere between $0.01 dilutive to $0.02 accretive to EPS before kind of their share of the $0.12 of incremental investment, and that's really made up, if you look at the kind of the BU level, it's -- you've got BCS is obviously continuing to come down. You've got both TS and ISS that we think of as being relatively neutral. And then HP Networking and storage growth and the profit margins that we see there then basically bring us up to basically this $0.01 dilutive to $0.02 accretive, and that has not changed since the security analyst meeting.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha from CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: A question on free cash flow, I think for both of you. Cathie, you mentioned that your free cash flow targets remain the same. So does guidance for this year of $6 billion to $6.5 billion, which should be down about 28%, even though income probably isn't going to be down anywhere near that, I understand the working capital headwind potentially as it is may change. But what are the other drivers? That's my first question. And the second one, kind of linked to that for both of you, if you have another year like you have had over the past 12 months, where you are able to operate at these very good levels of cash conversion, where does that incremental cash flow go? Does it still get split 50-50 between distribution and in acquisitions? Or do you actually do more in terms of buybacks?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with kind of the year-on-year, what's going on with free cash flow. And really, the big impact in free cash flow from an FY '14 perspective is the working capital pressure, the fact that at some level, we actually pulled cash into fiscal '13 by delivering a 17-day cash conversion cycle, and we will give some of that back when you back to the kind of the 20- to 21-day range. We also will see on a year-over-year basis CapEx pressure. Part of that CapEx pressure is due to better volumes in HP Financial Services. And then the other broad volume comment is there as well, and finally, restructuring. The restructuring cash payouts are significantly higher in fiscal '14 than in fiscal '13, and they are also more front-end loaded in '14 than they are -- than they were in '13. So that leads me to something that I think is important to talk about, and that's Q1 cash flow. Q1 cash flow, as you know, Q1 is typically our seasonally weakest cash flow quarter. It's going to be impacted by the working capital backup a bit and the fact that we've got these restructuring charges, cash outflows that are bit front-end loaded, and then as is typical, it is also impacted by our annual cash bonus.
Kulbinder Garcha: I'm sorry, what would be cash restructuring this fiscal year than cash restructuring?
Catherine Lesjak: So the cash outflow over this year is $1.4 billion in fiscal '14. And then in terms of your question, okay, now that you've generated -- you've gotten back to a net debt position, the opco optical level that is actually in that cash position, does that fundamentally change your capital allocation strategy, I think is ultimately what your question is. And the short answer is it doesn't. Because at the end of the day, our strategy is a returns-based framework with a long-term goal of a mid-single A. That still remains the same. Now it does give us a bit more flexibility because we had anticipated needing to reduce our net debt position further in the first half of fiscal '14, and now we don't need to do that. But it still remains that we're returns-based, and we'll look at the opportunities, whether they're share repurchase opportunities or M&A opportunities, and determine what is the best move for Hewlett-Packard and adding shareholder value.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Just had a question on the Enterprise Group operating margin. It was down about 20 basis points sequentially. Maybe just touch on it, how much of that was really driven due to the mix headwinds that you guys have talked about versus the pricing dynamics that you have alluded to? And on the pricing side, do you think that issue becomes less severe, now that one of your largest competitor in the ISS and PC side, Dell, is a private entity?
Catherine Lesjak: So the declines in margin year-over-year in EG were a combination of both a very competitive pricing environment and the unfavorable mix, and that's really what drove a lot of the declines on a year-over-year basis. In terms of will the competitive environment continue to be competitive with Dell going private, our expectation and the way we're planning and modeling is that this environment continues to be very competitive. We are not expecting any change in any of our competitor's stance from a pricing perspective.
Margaret Whitman: And this is Meg. I mean, the way we have to win in our Industry Standard Server group is obviously, we have to be a competitive cost -- we have to have a competitive cost structure, but we have to win through innovation. And whether that's Moonshot or our next-generation of ProLiant servers or HP OneView or the way we bundle together for the benefit of our channel partners, that's the way we're headed here. And so we're really focused on go to market and innovation, at the same time, making sure that we, from a server perspective, we look at end-to-end cost. How we design, how we source, how we ship and how much of it is config to order versus built to order, is also an important driver of cost; and then of course focusing on SKUs. More SKUs means more inventory means more logistics, and we've done a good job of actually focusing as we head into 2014.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I actually had a question on the commercial PC market with revenue up 4% year-over-year. I was curious as to -- I mean, that included the India units, I believe. But what are you seeing in terms of demand for convertibles, tablets in the market? How much of this is sort of end-of-life for XP? And how much of this, do you think, is repeatable?
Margaret Whitman: Well, I think -- listen, we have focused a lot on the commercial business. We like our product lineup for 2014. I think it's too early to tell how the demand for convertibles is going, whether it's in the commercial space or the consumer space. The Christmas season, we've got a lot of convertibles in the market, so do our competitors, and we're advertising behind us because we think it's a really innovative form factor, but it's the best of the tablet and the best of the PC. So I think we'll know more after we get through the Christmas season and on the consumer side. And then on the enterprise side, I think this is all about price and lineup, as what we see in the enterprise is CIOs are trying to match the device to the worker group and what they need. So maybe, a certain group of workers just needs BDI. There are some who need workstations, some who needs laptops. And whether they're backwards compatible to Windows or whether they're Chromebooks depends on what kind of work that team is doing. So that underscores our multi-OS, multi-architecture, multiform factor strategy that is frankly irrelevant to the commercial space as it is in the consumer space. So we are cautiously optimistic, although we're not in the business of really forecasting the PC, the core PC business growth. I mean, we've been wrong over a couple of quarters on this, and listen, IDC and others are forecasting 4% to 5% down next year, and I think that's probably a good assumption going into next year.
Catherine Lesjak: And Shannon, let me just clarify, because it is a bit confusing. The PC win that we had in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, in our numbers, is in consumer. It is not what's driving our commercial revenue increase. Now it's confusing because IDC puts it in commercial, so it's in the commercial share.
Shannon Cross: Okay. That's very helpful. Just really quickly, on end of life or XP, how are you thinking of that?
Margaret Whitman: So we're leading actually the migration off of XP. And we actually -- I think Microsoft would probably tell you we're among the leaders in terms of spearheading that migration. We've been on this for well over a year, and it's actually going pretty well.
Operator: Our next question comes from Peter Misek from Jefferies. Our next question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: Meg, you talked about -- in terms of looking for a permanent Chairman of the Board, you've talked about having a lot more interest given sort of the recovery of HP. I'm just curious where HP is [ph] in terms of finding a new permanent Chairman of the Board and following that, any indication of whether or not Ralph Whitworth would still continue to sit on the board.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So Ralph, as you know, is Chairman of the Board on an interim basis, and he has stepped up to the plate beautifully. And we really are very grateful to his service. He's done a great job. And he said the other day, he'll continue to serve until we find someone else. So you should assume he's in place for the foreseeable future, and we're just delighted with his working relationship with management team, with the board. He's made an outstanding contribution, so he'll be in place until we find someone else.
Operator: Our final question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: I want to ask a question about the 3D printing opportunity. Meg, you've highlighted this as an opportunity, and you seem genuinely interested in the market. So what are your aspirations in terms of market position relative to your leading position in the traditional printing market? And do you think you can reach that organically? Or do you think you have to acquire an established player?
Margaret Whitman: So we intend to play in the 3D printing market because it is an adjacency. It's obviously different than paper printing, but the sum of the technology is the same. And at least as we sit here today, we anticipate entering this organically. And what we're doing is focusing on what's the value proposition by market segment, whether that be consumer or industrial, what's the competitive differentiation, and we've got some very interesting things coming. So stay tuned in 2014. But this is an acorn, right? You've heard me say we got to plant acorns and they will eventually become oak trees. But you should think in 2014 and 2015, this is an acorn that maybe has very good long potential, but the market is at its earlier stages and there are a lot of technology work that needs to be done to be able to print in the kind of timeframe that most consumers and most industries would actually find acceptable.
Rob Binns: Great. Super. Thanks for that, and thanks, everyone. And I think with that, we'll conclude the questions. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2013 Q3  (2013-08-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Adriane, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.

The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we continue our "fix and rebuild year," parts of the business like Printing, Enterprise Services, Converged Storage and Software are making progress, while others like Industry Standard Servers and Personal Systems have not completely turned the corner. So overall, I would say our turnaround continues. We're moving forward against our plans and I remain comfortable with where we're heading. Most importantly, we once again achieved the financial performance we said we would, delivering $0.86 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, within our previously provided outlook of $0.84 to $0.87. During the third quarter, we held our annual HP DISCOVER event in Las Vegas. We brought together more than 11,000 people, including more than 120 of the world's top CIOs. These are record numbers for HP. I was encouraged by the interest I heard from our customers about technologies like HP Moonshot, StoreOnce, 3PAR, software-defined networking, Vertica and Autonomy. At HP DISCOVER, we introduced some very significant new innovations. We announced HAVEn, a big data analytics platform that leverages our analytics software, hardware and services to allow customers to make decisions in realtime. We also expanded our Converged Cloud portfolio with a common OpenStack-based architecture for HP's private, managed and public cloud offerings. And we announced a new partnership with Google to introduce a one-stop shop technology solution for small and medium-sized business customers. As I said before HP's turnaround will happen on the back of great products and services. As the benefits of our focus and investment begin to pay dividends in 2014, I expect that you will see increased innovation across HP. From a macroeconomic standpoint, we see a continued weak enterprise spending environment. Sentiment in the U.S. is improving, although it's not translating to our results yet due to inconsistent execution. I would characterize Europe as challenging and China continues to be soft. We're also seeing acceleration in trends, driving customers to the cloud and shifting to mobility. For the third quarter, our results were driven by solid execution in Software, Printing, Converged Storage and Enterprise Services, coupled with the savings from our restructuring program and improvements in our operations. As a result of our focus on operations, we were able to bring our cash conversion cycle down to 18 days, a remarkable achievement compared to 27 days in the prior year. In the quarter, operating cash flow was $2.7 billion. Once again, another strong performance. As a result, we lowered operating company net debt by $1.7 billion to $1.2 billion. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of reducing our operating company net debt by more than $1 billion. Our operating company net debt is now below pre-Autonomy levels and is approaching our goal of approximately 0. We also returned approximately $283 million to shareholders, primarily in the form of dividends in the quarter. Along with the operational improvements and the workforce restructuring, we're focused on getting the right leadership in place to lead the company through the next phase of the turnaround. To that end, we announced several changes to our executive leadership team during the quarter. In June, Dion Weisler took up our Printing and Personal Systems. Dion is more aggressively shifting to a multi-operating system, multi-architecture and multi-form factor strategy. And earlier today, we announced additional changes to our executive leadership team. Bill Veghte, currently HP's Chief Operating Officer, will become EVP and General Manager of the Enterprise Group, replacing Dave Donatelli, who will remain with HP and take on a special assignment. Bill brings a critical set of skills to the management of HP's Enterprise Group. He is a proven technology executive with a wide range of experiences leading sales, services, marketing and engineering at scale. During his tenure at HP, he has run HP Software, held the responsibility of Chief Strategy Officer and, for over 15 months, has served as HP's Chief Operating Officer. As COO, Bill helped create HP's blueprint for the future and deeply understands the strategic challenges and opportunities facing both the company and its customers. As hardware becomes more standardized, leadership solutions are increasingly differentiated by the software layer that drives the hardware. This is true for both traditional IT and cloud environments. Bill will retain his current responsibility for the pan-HP cloud initiative. And Bill's experiences in Software and in the Enterprise, combined with HP's infrastructure leadership, will help HP accelerate innovation in Converged Infrastructure, cloud and the emerging area of software-defined data centers. In a separate organizational move, Henry Gomez, EVP and Chief Communications Officer, will assume the additional responsibilities of Chief Marketing Officer. By combining marketing and communications, we will accelerate programs that will drive sales, build brand loyalty and help customers embrace the new style of IT. HP's current CMO, Marty Homlish, will become Chief Customer Experience Officer, a new role that will focus on driving more consistent and high-value interactions with customer across all business units. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. As you would expect in a turnaround, there are areas where we're doing well and areas where we have to improve. Let me start with the parts of the business that performed well in the quarter. In Printing, we once again delivered a solid quarter. Business initiatives like Ink Advantage and new products like Officejet Pro X continue to take hold with strong customer adoption. As a result, we're seeing strength in our Ink in the Office program. Overall, we grew hardware unit sales for the first time since 2011, gaining 1 point of share in both ink and laser over the prior year and 5 points of share in laser over the prior quarter. The Printing team has done a very good job executing the strategy we laid out last October. Although revenue is down, profitability is line with our expectations and the top line is stabilizing. Printing revenue was down 3.6% over the prior year and 1.4% in constant currency, while margins were 15.6%, essentially flat over the prior year. In Enterprise Services, the business is stabilizing as we continue to execute well against our recovery plan. Revenue was down 8.7% over the prior year, better than the FY '13 outlook range we previously provided. We saw add-on business offset the anticipated revenue runoff from the 4 exceptional accounts we identified at our Security Analyst Meeting last October. Margin in the quarter was 3.3%, bringing Enterprise Services year-to-date margins to 2.4%, at the high end of our FY '13 outlook range. We continue to see improvements in signings, but they are mostly renewals. Going forward, we're focused on strengthening our go-to-market capabilities dedicated to strategic enterprise service solutions in areas like cloud, big data and apps modernization and new account wins. As we outlined in October, this will be a multiyear journey. Enterprise Services was able to secure some major wins in the third quarter. We announced that Enterprise Services and its partners were awarded the United States Department of the Navy's Next Generation Enterprise Network, contract value at up to $3.4 billion over 5 years. The contract's being protested, but we have every confidence in the Navy's evaluation and the ultimate selection of HP. In the Enterprise Group, we're making progress in executing our vision of Converged Infrastructure based on HP intellectual property and the software-defined data center. We see near term revenue pressures in ISS and some parts of storage where we face aggressive pricing and competition. Customer interest in our revolutionary HP Moonshot product has been strong. We're working hard to ramp this product in the market. We're currently in testing and development with many key customers and expect to roll out a number of new innovations on this platform over the next few quarters. In Storage, we're seeing the planned portfolio shift continue with strong performance in our Converged Storage business, which was up 37% over the prior year, being offset by weakness in traditional storage. We continue to see solid growth in our mid-range 3PAR products that were launched in the first quarter. While we were pleased with our Networking performance in China, revenue was essentially flat and we must grow this business faster. Going forward, we're focusing on new channel plays and improved go-to-market actions to accelerate growth. Enterprise Group had a number of significant customer wins in the quarter. HP was selected as the official technology partner to Oriental DreamWorks, the joint venture between the China consortium led by China Media Capital and DreamWorks Animation. In Software, we saw good performance and improved execution. We grew revenue nearly 1% over the prior year and 4.3% sequentially. We saw continued improvement in operating leverage as margin expanded 2.5 points over the prior year and 1.4 points over the prior quarter and achieved an operating margin of 20.5%. Performance in Software was driven by strength in security, which saw double-digit revenue growth; strong momentum in Vertica, which saw triple-digit growth; and sequential license revenue growth in Autonomy. In addition, we saw pockets of improvement in IT management, although we saw continued pressure from the shift to SaaS, coupled with a portfolio that is weighted towards services and support. Now let me turn to where our performance needs to improve. Overall, the Enterprise Group's performance was very disappointing. Enterprise Group profitability was pressured by lower revenue, particularly in ISS, resulting in an operating margin of 15.2%, down 1.9 points over the prior year and 0.7 points sequentially. ISS continues to experience near term business model challenges, impacting our competitiveness in the hyperscale market. In addition, mainstream server weakness was driven by execution challenges, competitive pricing and a misaligned go-to-market model. This impacted our revenue and profitability. The net impact of these execution challenges is an expected loss of 5 points of market share on a revenue basis. Fixing execution across Enterprise Group will be Bill Veghte's top priority in his new role. In our Personal Systems business, we're seeing continued PC market contraction, as HP revenue declined 11% over the prior year. On a positive note, in the third quarter, we saw relative strength and market share gains in growth markets like Asia-Pacific and in commercial PCs. According to IDC's second calendar results, HP has achieved its highest ever PC share in India with 34.1%, leading in every category of the PC market. Overall, margin for the quarter was 3%, down 0.2 points sequentially and down 1.7 points over the prior year. Looking forward, we're focused on drive profitable growth in Personal Systems. It's going to take time to get to get margins to our desired levels against the backdrop of a changing marketplace, but we're confident that our differentiated approach from competitors, including our focus on beyond-the-box innovation, will pay off over the long term. Now let me turn to our future outlook. As you know, I stated in May that I believe that company level revenue growth was still possible in fiscal 2014, particularly given the challenges I just highlighted in Enterprise Group and Personal Systems, as well as the fact that 2013 revenue from key accounts in Enterprise Services is running off more slowly than anticipated, we now expect that total company year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2014 is unlikely. That said, I remain confident that we are making progress in our turnaround. We are already seeing significant improvement in our operations. We are successfully rebuilding our balance sheet. Our cost structure is more closely aligned with our revenue and we have reignited innovation at HP, with a focus on the customer. So I do expect that we'll see pockets of year-over-year revenue growth across certain parts of the business in 2014. As is our normal practice, we'll give a more comprehensive outlook on 2014, including EPS, at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 9 and I look forward to seeing you all there. Now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. Total revenue for the quarter was $27.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year and down 7% in constant currency. Overall, our results came in largely as expected with some variance in performance among the business units. Enterprise Services came in slightly ahead of expectations and Printing and Software were broadly in line. However, a weak PC market and increasingly competitive pricing pressured Personal Systems and execution challenges and aggressive pricing impacted Industry Standard Server performance. I'll go into more detail on each segment shortly. By region, EMEA remains weak, particularly in consumer, with revenue of $9.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. Revenue in Americas of $12.4 billion, declined 7% year-over-year as reported and in local currency, partly driven by weakness in U.S. public sector spending, as well as soft demand in Brazil and Canada. APJ was mixed with strong growth in India, due in part our recent educational PC win in the state of Uttar Pradesh, partially offsetting weaker China performance. APJ revenue was $5.2 billion, down 8% year-over-year and down 5% in constant currency. Turning to gross margins. Improved Enterprise Services in Technology Services margins, combined with a favorable mix from Software, Printing and Personal Systems, offset a highly competitive pricing environment across most of our hardware businesses. Gross margins were flat on a year-over-year basis and down 30 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, down 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, driven by expense benefits from restructuring actions and lower R&D investments in Business Critical Systems. Non-GAAP operating profit of $2.3 billion was 8.4% of revenue, down 80 basis points year-over-year. We recorded $146 million of expense on the other income and expense line. With a 22% tax rate and roughly flat share count of 1.9 billion shares outstanding, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.86. Our non-GAAP EPS excludes pretax charges of $356 million in amortization of purchased intangibles, $81 million of restructuring charges and $4 million in acquisition-related charges. Turning to the business groups. I'll start with Printing. We continue to execute on our strategy and the group delivered solid results in the third quarter. Revenue of $5.8 billion was down 4% year-over-year. Total unit shipments grew 5% year-over-year as we took advantage of the depreciating yen to place more units and partially offset other currency headwinds. Operating profit of $908 million or 15.6% of revenue was down 0.2 points from last year. Commercial hardware revenue declined 3% year-over-year, while units increased 12%. We experienced strength in low-end laser sales, while high-end revenue declined due to mix shift in the value segment. We saw good growth in managed services and Indigo sales. Consumer hardware revenue was flat, while units increased 2% against the prior year, driven by strong Ink in the Office and Ink Advantage sales. Supplies revenue declined 4% against the prior year and made up 66% of Printing revenue. Our overall channel inventory has moved slightly above our target range. This was partly driven by supplies demand from our channel partners, seeking to maintain service and reliability levels to their customers. We need to bring down channel inventory in the fourth quarter. Personal Systems continues to face a challenging environment. Revenue was $7.7 billion, down 11% over prior year, led by weakness in consumer. Total unit shipments declined 8% year-over-year. We saw broad-based regional softness led by EMEA. Consumer sales declined 22% year-over-year, while commercial performed much better, down just 3%. Commercial unit shipments outpaced the market by 8% year-over-year and we maintained our #1 market share position in this category. Continued pricing pressure and currency headwinds drove an operating profit of $228 million or 3% of revenue, down 1.7 points over prior year. Personal Systems contributed just 9% of HP segment operating profit. We remain focused on improving profitability in this business over the long term. Turning to Enterprise Group. Results were weaker than expected, with revenue down 9% year-over-year to $6.8 billion. We continue to see positive momentum with our Converged Storage solution, but we faced extreme competitive pricing in Industry Standard Server and Storage and continued weakness in traditional storage demand. We are also working to address execution challenges across ISS. And as Meg noted, we need to improve the go-to-market fundamentals across the Enterprise Group. Operating profit was $1 billion or 15.2% of revenue, down 1.9 points from last year. Higher margins in Technology Services helped offset weakness in the other businesses, primarily ISS and Storage. By business unit, Industry Standard Server revenue declined 11% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. We saw double-digit declines in mainstream and hyperscale. Hyperscale results partly reflected a tough compare over the prior year. Storage revenue declined 10% year-over-year to $833 million. We remain excited about our Converged Storage offering, which grew 37% year-over-year. 3PAR was up double digits again and StoreOnce continued to do well. Together, 3PAR plus XP plus EDA -- a metric that adjusts for the planned product transition -- outgrew the market. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 26% year-over-year, consistent with expectations at $284 million. We continue to face Itanium pressures and the overall UNIX market secular declines persisted. This more than offset solid growth in mission-critical x86 sales. Networking sales were flat year-over-year at $644 million. We continue to make strides in Wireless LAN and have had strong customer interest in our new software-defined networking solutions that we introduced earlier this year. That was offset by weakness in U.S. public sector spending. Finally, in Technology Services, revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $2.2 billion driven by hardware decline, particularly in BCS and traditional storage. We are focused on improving our attach rates on our newer products. Turning to Enterprise Services. Revenue of $5.8 billion declined 9% year-over-year as public sector austerity measures continued to pressure discretionary IT spending, particularly in the U.S. and U.K., but performance was still ahead of where we expected due to incremental business offsetting expected runoff. Operating profit of $192 million or 3.3% of revenue was down 0.5 points year-over-year due to higher operating expenses on a tough year-over-year compare, offsetting improvements in resource management and cost control and our handling of underperforming contracts. By business unit, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.7 billion, down 7% year-over-year and Applications and Business Services revenue was $2.2 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Both business units were significantly impacted by contractual runoff. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue continues to grow double digits driven by cloud, security, application modernization and big data solutions. We are pleased with the execution progress across ES. Our signings were up double digits both year-over-year and sequentially driven by renewals. However, our ability to grow sales beyond traditional offerings needs to improve. Growing our bookings at SES by better embedding in our large deals and winning smaller deals remains a top area of focus. Software had a solid quarter with revenue up 1% year-over-year to $982 million. We are especially pleased with the continued performance in our strategic areas of cloud, security and big data. Sales of our security solutions grew double digits, while Vertica revenue was up triple digits. At the same time, we continue to prune our Professional Services portfolio, which tempers revenue growth but improves profitability. Operating profit for the quarter was $201 million or 20.5% of revenue. This was up 2.5 points year-over-year and 1.4 points sequentially, showing real signs of improved operating leverage. License revenue was flat year-over-year, while support revenue grew 4% over the prior year. By design, Professional Services revenue declined 11% from last year and SaaS revenue was up 4% on prior year, which is below our expectations, but bookings growth was solid in the quarter. Across Software, we saw better sales execution this quarter with improved license conversion, but we still have work to do on building our pipeline and continuing to improve our sales execution. HP Financial Services revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $879 million due to Enterprise Services volume decline, offsetting solid direct business growth. Financing volumes were down 9% year-over-year, with net portfolio assets of $12 billion, down 4%. Operating profit was $99 million or 11.3% of revenue. The return on equity in HP Financial Services continues to be strong. Moving on to our balance sheet and capital allocation for the quarter. We continue to execute our strategy of driving free cash flow and strengthening our balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $2.7 billion in the quarter, down 6% year-over-year and free cash flow was $2 billion, down 2%. We continue to see improvement in working capital with the cash conversion cycle down 9 days year-over-year to 18 days. The year-over-year reduction was driven primarily by improvements in days payable. Sequentially, the reduction of 3 days was in line with typical seasonality for days payable and days inventory, where we were able to offset the increases from the large deals I noted last quarter with other inventory improvements. Days sales outstanding was better than normal seasonality as a result of strong collections, as well as better usage of cash discounts. I want to take a minute to comment on our share repurchase program. In Q3, we spent just $3 million on repurchasing 168,000 shares in the quarter, well below our historical levels. During the quarter, we had material nonpublic information that prevented us from putting in place a share buyback plan as we typically do. However, we have developed a plan for Q4 that will ramp up our spending to offset dilution from Q3 and Q4, but will remain in line with our broader FY '13 goal of rebuilding our balance sheet. We will provide an update on our capital allocation priorities for fiscal '14 at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. We remain committed to overall capital distribution to shareholders and we paid out $280 million in dividends in Q3. Gross cash at the end of the quarter was $13.7 billion. Operating company net debt was $1.2 billion, down another $1.7 billion from the last quarter and down $10.6 billion from the peak in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. I am pleased with our progress in reducing operating company net debt. And on August 1, we further reduced gross debt by paying off a $1.1 billion maturity. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we see mixed trends. At a macro level, we expect consumer demand weakness in the PC industry will likely continue to impact Personal Systems and we expect continued pricing pressure in Printing, Personal Systems and Industry Standard Servers. At the same time, we expect to see more favorable trends in demand for commercial PCs relative to consumer. We expect Printing to continue to perform well as we utilize yen tailwinds to place more units. But as we mentioned, we do have a little bit more work to do to bring down supplies channel inventory. For Enterprise Services, contractual runoffs continue but we expect the overall full year revenue decline to be in the 8% to 9% range, less than the 11% to 13% range we indicated in the Q2 earnings call. For the year, we continue to expect margins to be at the high end of our 0% to 3% range that we provided last October. Software will have a tough Q4 compare due to the large General Motors deal we noted last year. We still expect to see improved execution and strong customer demand across our big data, security and cloud offerings. Finally, we anticipate 1 point of currency headwind to revenue in Q4. With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.53 to $3.57. We expect full year fiscal 2013 GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.67 to $2.71. Finally, although we don't typically update our cash flow outlook quarterly, we think it makes sense to update our expectations given our Q3 cash flow performance. We now expect free cash flow to approach $8 billion for the full fiscal year 2013. We did better than expected in Q3, but we believe the Q3 cash conversion cycle was below what we consider to be a sustainable long-term rate, so we expect some pullback in Q4. I know everyone wants to hear our view on fiscal '14, but we will provide our detailed outlook at our upcoming Security Analyst Meeting on October 9. We look forward to seeing you all then. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And we have Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz: Meg, the first question's for you. I was curious regarding this commentary around execution. Can you give us a little more specifics, particularly in context of today's management changes? How much is driven by technology deficiencies versus go-to-market or both? And I just want to see how we should think about trajectory, if there's a lot more R&D required going forward? And then I have a follow-up for Cathie, if I could, around the services business. I hear you on the revenue decline, that being -- that is expected at last October's analyst meeting. But how should we think about some of the services slippage going forward as these extensions with some of these 4 exceptional services customers unwind? Will there be any sort of operating margin hit down the road that we should prepare for?
Margaret Whitman: Great. Well, let me take the first one. So we were disappointed, as I've said, in EG's performance this quarter and there are a couple of issues. I think this is less technology than it is a number of other areas. First is, we've got to have the right products targeted to the market segments that we choose to go after with the right cost structure. And we've got some more work to do on having a competitive cost structure around supply chain, as well as our manufacturing strategy. We also have got to simplify and make more effective our selling motion. This is a very big, very complicated sales motion. And frankly, we've got to simplify it. And then, we've got see our channel programs that we put in place earlier this year and some changes to the partner compensation program in August have got to work. And actually, there's some bright spots there. But my view is, we've got some operational excellence work that needs to be done here. So I actually am quite confident in our technology. I'm confident in our next-generation blades, in Moonshot. I think we can turn the corner on this, but we're going to have -- we have a bit more work to do.
Catherine Lesjak: And also on the services business question, in terms of the slippage. So I'm not sure I would call it slippage. That sounds unplanned in some way. We've been working closely with these top 4 accounts and at least 1 of them is completely done but the 3 that remain. And we're working very methodically to make sure that their transition works well. And frankly, that gives us time to come in and do a couple of things: A, get our cost structure in line for now the new run rate business; but also, it's enabling us a chance to come in and sell a bit more on a sell-and-bill basis within the quarter. And we saw that this quarter. So this quarter, we had just the runoff from these exceptional accounts and we hadn't been able to bring in some additional revenue, then the reduction in revenue would've been much better -- much lower -- I'm sorry, much higher, much worse. And so I think that, that's giving us time. So I think actually letting these things take a little bit longer to transition has been good for us.
Operator: And we have Toni Sacconaghi.
Toni Sacconaghi: Meg, I was wondering if you could comment a little more on the management changes. In the last 2 months, you've changed leadership of business units that comprise more than 80% of your profits. So you outlined some of the things that you were dissatisfied with. Perhaps you can comment on what are the specific marching orders to the new executives? And can you also comment on why you are not looking to attract talent from the outside? I think in your press release you said the imperative is to rapidly respond with fresh ideas and bold execution. Fresh ideas often come from the outside and all the management changes that have occurred recently have included promotions solely from within. So marching orders and then recruiting outside talent and I have a separate follow-up, please.
Margaret Whitman: Okay, good. So this, as I have said for a long time, is a 5-year turnaround with appropriate milestones along the way. But we're entering the next phase of the turnaround. And my view is, we need to accelerate into the next turn. And my job is to get the right people in the right job at the right time with the right experience and domain expertise. And as I evaluate the performance of each of these businesses, what I think is necessary, then I've got to match the right executive to the challenge at the time. And I am excited about the makeup of this new team. And you're right, Toni, I have relied more on promote from within because we've got a lot of very talented executives in the company, who have been in second or third level jobs, who are more than capable of stepping up. In the case of the Dion Weisler, the results in APJ for PPS are really quite good. And it takes a long time to learn how HP does things and understand the business. In the case of Bill Veghte, he had been our Chief Operating Officer, had helped plot the blueprint for the future and brings a tremendous amount of software expertise to a business that has relied more on software to differentiate the hardware than the bare metal. Also has tremendous expertise in selling, ran Microsoft North America. And one of our big weaknesses here is our selling motion and our sales go to market. So it's always a balance. I have brought some new people in from the outside, but you're right. I tend to want to go with people who I think have the fresh ideas and the energy and the enthusiasm, but also don't have to start at the beginning of the learning curve.
Operator: And we have Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, can you talk a little more specifically about the cash cycle improvement in the quarter? And importantly, why you don't think that's sustainable? Were there mix or timing situations this quarter that won't continue? And then also, can you reconcile the fact that printer hardware units growth was the best in a couple of years and yet printer supplies growth declined this quarter, which was a deterioration from last quarter and you're sort of down ticking on the outlook around printer supplies as well?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Katy. On the cash conversion cycle, first off, we're very pleased with the performance that we've delivered both in Q3, as well as, frankly, throughout the year around cash flow. What is showing up in the numbers is the work we did to educate everybody in the company, help them understand how they can contribute to improving cash flow. And then, frankly, also embedding in a more significant way cash flow into the executive's bonus metrics doesn't hurt either. And so we've seen that kind of improvement. Specifically in Q3, one of the big drivers of the year-over-year improvement was in days payable. And that is really -- that was the result of some purchasing linearity in the quarter. When we step back and we look at what is a long-term sustainable kind of cash conversion cycle for the company, we think it's more in the low-20s. And that's really where the pullback that we expect to see in Q4 as well. So that's on that side. In terms of the hardware units, again, what we did this quarter was we were able to use the kind of the yen tailwind that we have in our cost structure to really go after more units. And we saw that with units being up 5% year-over-year, in the commercial space up 12% year-over-year, in the consumer space up 2%. And so we're really pleased with having that opportunity to get those units out for exactly the reason that you raised is that, in a fairly short amount of time, that's going to drive additional supplies consumption. In terms of the specifics around the quarter for supplies this quarter, we do expect that supplies will continue to be relatively volatile quarter-to-quarter. Our strategies for the long term are really to drive units out there that will ultimately use more HP-branded ink. Those strategies are things like Ink in the Office, Ink Advantage, ink subscription, multifunction printers, managed print services, those are all really designed to drive more supplies per unit. And while it's still early days, the early indications are encouraging that those strategies are going to bear out.
Operator: And we have Jim Suva from Citi Research.
Jim Suva: Meg, a quick question. It seems like a while ago you were talking with a lot of confidence about the 5-year program, especially with a revenue growth next year. It seems like now that the confidence is downshifting a little bit and maybe I misinterpreted the tone of your voice recently or maybe it is true. Is it mostly due to PCs? Or kind of how should we think about your confidence in outlook and is this 5-year program changing at all?
Margaret Whitman: No, so listen, I'm very confident that our turnaround is working. As you would expect in any turnaround, some businesses are performing better than you would think and some are somewhat performing not as well as you would hope. But what has changed about 2014's revenue outlook for me is a couple of things. First is, Enterprise Group's performance, especially during the last quarter. I would say that weak execution has amplified the market challenges that we know exist and it's been a very aggressive pricing environment. The server market growth rates have come down in the last quarter. The PC market has not stabilized as much as I had anticipated it would. That stabilization is yet to occur. And then finally, Enterprise Services, which is good for this year, is running -- the revenue is running off more slowly this year, which is good for this year, but creates growth challenges for next year. So I am confident that we can address the challenges. There are some segments that will absolutely grow next year and will deliver very good performance. But I think it is unlikely, given the changes that have occurred over the last quarter or so, that we're going to see growth in 2014 as I had hoped.
Jim Suva: Okay. That's on the revenue side, but then also on the profitability side. It seems like cash flow is better and restructuring is progressing well. Do you think on the earnings side you could see growth or just the top line is so much pressure?
Margaret Whitman: So we're being very smart about this. As smart as we can in a dynamic market, which is, it's not growth at any cost, all right? We want to manage the margin revenue trade-off here. And we'll give you a lot more insight to that in our Security Analyst Meeting, where we're going to talk about our earnings per share projection, capital allocation, the investments we need to make and where we think the growth is going to come from next year by market segment.
Operator: And we have Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Can you talk a little bit about the Technology Services business? That had been very stable and it kind of dipped down 7% and inflected. And I think that's your most profitable business at the whole company, even more profitable than the software. And then just one clarification. I wanted to know, Meg, that the server business, ISS, has been declining for several quarters. I believe this is the seventh or eighth in a row or sixth or seventh in a row. And I was wondering, like, why now, why didn't we hear about this a couple of quarters ago? And what actually came to light to make the decision happen now on this call rather than over the last year?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Ben. Let me start with the Technology Services question that you have. One of the things that we are absolutely seeing in Technology Services is the need to really improve our attach rates on some of our newer products. And so as some of the older products like Business Critical Systems, which has a very strong attach and penetration rate, as that has a long tail but it is coming down and hardware in general has been coming down, that's starting to impact Technology Services. And so what we're doing about that is trying to improve our attach on the newer products and then also coming out of new innovative service offerings, like what we call Proactive Care or what we call Datacenter Care, kind of coming out with these new offerings to somewhat cushion the pressure that we're seeing because hardware sales are declining. If you go back and you look at fiscal '11 and fiscal '12, we were able to improve the penetration rates in storage and in networking over 300 basis points each. In this year, we've had a little bit of a step back. And particularly in this quarter, we were down a little bit on pen rates and that's really due to mix. We've got to get the attach rates up on the newer products.
Margaret Whitman: Let me take the question on our Enterprise Group performance overall. The server business has been under pressure for some time. The pricing in the marketplace is as intense as I've seen it since I've been at HP. But the revenue share loss this quarter was bigger than we had anticipated. I said in the script it was 5 points of share loss on a revenue basis. And we have got to move faster on our hyperscale initiatives. We've got to -- and Moonshot will be the disruptive force there, so we've got to move that faster. And then we must see networking grow faster. We are the upstart in this business. So a flat networking performance is not what we need to see. And then frankly, our Storage business, the Converged Storage part is growing well, but the decline in tape and other areas, XP, we can do better than that. So my job, as I said, is to make sure that we are positioning these businesses for the future. And what I ask of our senior executives, to sort of double back to Toni's question that I didn't answer as directly as I could have, is listen, set realistic targets, deliver on your commitments while keeping an eye on the long term. I've said for a long time, we're not here for this quarter or for this year. We are trying to set HP up for another really great run here. You got to decide where you're going to play and how you're going to win. Because this isn't all about revenue growth. This is a margin revenue trade-off business and we have to be very clear about where we want to play and how it is that we're going to win. And then make sure you have done a perfect job of segmenting your market and marrying the right products to that market segmentation. And if you do that and manage your cost structure, we'll have a very successful business here. So that's what I'm looking for. And this is something historically HP's done really well, but it is not being done as well as it could be in all parts of the business. And it needs to be a real strength of the company going forward, especially as we are navigating these incredible shifts in the industry. It's not business as usual in our industry and we have to be better at it than we've been in the last year or 2.
Operator: We have Brian Alexander from Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Just on the leadership change. Do you expect trends in the Enterprise business to deteriorate further as you go through this transition? And at what point, Meg, would you actually hope that this business would start growing again? And with the change in responsibilities for Dave Donatelli, how should we think about HP's emphasis on returning to M&A as a key growth driver given you now have 2 very senior executives focused on early-stage opportunities?
Margaret Whitman: So listen, we are in a happy position now from a capital allocation perspective of being able to -- our capital allocation strategy has been very clear. Return cash to shareholders in dividends, buyback enough shares to offset dilution and pay down debt. So we now have an opportunity to say, where can we use strategic acquisitions to further our overall objectives as a company? And we will be back in the market as we think about acquisitions that can further our objectives. Again, we will be incredibly measured and disciplined. We are very mindful of the event that we just came off with Autonomy. So don't worry about that. We are very focused and disciplined. But I think as we see these big tectonic plate shifts, there's no question that acquisitions are going to have to be a part of how we turn this company around. So listen, there's a lot of changes going on in the marketplace. The good news about EG -- someone asked me the question earlier, do you think it's a technology problem? In other words, you're not spending enough R&D? I actually don't think that's the case. I think we have the right technology. We've got to work on go to market. We've got to work on cost structure. And we've got to work on market segmentation. Which, frankly, are easier, more near-term things that can be fixed as opposed to hoping that we're going to have the right product 2 or 3 or 4 years from now based on what's in the labs today. I am less worried about that and much more focused on what I would call more prosaic execution.
Operator: We have Maynard Um from Wells Fargo.
Maynard Um: On your go-to-market, I'm just curious. Your partner changes were put in place on May 1 or somewhere around there, so you've had about 3 months since implementation. So is the go-to-market change a function of not having had it right initially or is it something else? I'm just curious how long -- you seem to imply that these are sort of short-term things, I'm just curious if it really is a short-term thing or if these are changes in the channel that need to sort of play out over a period of time, multi-quarters. And if not, why, if it's a short-term phenomenon?
Margaret Whitman: So whenever you make changes to your go-to-market selling motion, these take a while to work through the system. And our channel partners have just gotten their first checks from the new compensation program that went in, in June. And actually, there's some light at the end of that tunnel. We feel good about the changes we made to our partner selling motion. But go-to-market is more than just a coverage model. It is our ability to price. It is our ability to provide the specialists and the solution architects that are needed to sell. It is about our ability to compel -- to provide compelling bundles of server and storage, of like an appliance for some of our software elements. So it's a holistic view of go-to-market. I think there's some real light at the end of the tunnel. We've had our AGMs and our AEs in place now for a number of quarters, in fact a number of years now, and so there's more account consistency. But there's still work to do here. And frankly and my view is, we've made this a bit more complicated than we need to have. And simplicity, in my experience in sales organizations, is simplicity and clarity of role and the right people against the right opportunities is critical.
Operator: We have Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I have 2 questions, one with a follow-up. The first is, can you talk a little bit about strategy in terms of profit versus your willingness to price and to take share? Obviously, some of your competitors are being extremely aggressive in certain areas. Is this a situation where you just don't want to follow them down and so you're going to continue to give up share? Or how are you sort of weighing that? Because obviously, in printers you're willing to do that, where you have the yen benefit. But I'm thinking in some of the other categories where you have seen some share slippage.
Catherine Lesjak: Shannon, our focus, whether it's in Industry Standard Servers, which Meg talked a little bit about a few minutes ago, or in PCs that we talked about for a long time, same thing in printers, is that we're focused on long-term profitability. And so if in the short term there are reasons to make an investment that we think will give us a good return, then we'll do that deal. And it may not always make money, at least on a fully-loaded basis, but our goal is long-term profitability. And we believe that ultimately, the way we're going to get there is investing in our own IP, driving products and services that have a strong value proposition for customers and will then enable us to compete very effectively. You even saw in PCs this quarter, we were able to do well from a profitability perspective and also gain share. So we gained share both year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter. But ultimately, the decision is, what's the best thing for this business over the long term and how we're going to drive profitability.
Shannon Cross: Okay. And then can you just talk a bit about what you've seen in China? If there are any more details you can give in terms of demand, enterprise, government, consumer, linearity during the quarter? Just any color you can provide on what's going on over in China.
Margaret Whitman: Well, I'll make some top-level comments and Cathie can chime in. China is softer than we'd anticipated. And it is actually across the board. We are seeing more rapid growth in Tier 4 through 6 cities, a little less in the big areas. But it is reasonably soft demand across the board, at least as we see it. You want to add anything to that Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Let me give you just some data points. Networking in China for us was very strong. We saw very good growth year-over-year in networking in China. And you all may not focus on this but we do, we are the leading market shareholder in China for networking. So we're pleased with the results in networking. And then in printing as well on a local currency basis year-over-year, we grew revenue as well. That's in the context of what Meg said is that, overall, the economy does seem to be slowing a bit.
Operator: We have Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: I wanted to see if you could give us update on the restructuring and the cost opportunities that still have yet to show up? And the reason I asked the question, it's not apparent that HP's getting material benefits from the cost restructuring activity. So if I look at the guidance for this fiscal year, your operating profit dollars are going to be down roughly $1.5 billion. And that's assuming that you're getting cost savings that are flowing to the income statement of about $1.5 billion. So why aren't we seeing more of this show up in terms of the income statement? Because I know, Meg, you've said that you're making some investments. But it seems like an extraordinary amount. And then how much still has yet to be delivered in terms of the cost action and will we see any of that show up? And that's it for my question.
Catherine Lesjak: So Keith, let me give some update on the restructuring program. Of course, we've got 2 dimensions to it. Of course, we've got the labor and the nonlabor. From a labor perspective the restructuring remains on track. We had roughly 3,800 people leave under the program in Q3. On a program-to-date basis, that's roughly 22,500 people have left under the program. And we're on track to hit the 26,000 roughly exiting under the program by the end of fiscal '13. So I would say good progress on the labor side. On the nonlabor side, we're on track in most areas and ahead in others. And so we're feeling good about the nonlabor progress as well. And it's really both the labor and the nonlabor savings that's enabling us to compete and price more effectively in the market. And I think that, that gets to kind of your second question. If you go back to our EPS guidance implied for Q4, specifically that's roughly normal seasonality at the EPS line. But that's not -- we don't have the same seasonal growth in the revenue line. And the difference between that is basically the savings that are getting generated under the labor and the nonlabor restructuring effort. That's what's cushioning the bottom line. If it weren't for those savings coming through, the results would be materially lower.
Keith Bachman: I guess, Cathie, just a follow-up, if I could though. But the challenge there for investors is when the cost cuts run out, the pricing in the market will presumably still remain. How do we reconcile that with HP being able to grow its earnings over time? And then, sorry, I'll cede the floor.
Catherine Lesjak: I think, Keith, part of the challenge, obviously, is the macro and our execution issues. These savings are frankly giving us the -- if I can call it, air cover or room and time to actually fix execution issues. And hopefully, over time, the macro environment starts to become a little bit easier. We're not planning on that when we think about '14, but it does give us kind of this time to fix some of our execution issues.
Margaret Whitman: The other thing I would add here is, that while we are making these cost cuts, we are making investments that we think will result in revenue growth over time. And we have 3 segments of businesses. We've got businesses that are growing, businesses that are maintaining roughly flat and then we have declining businesses. The mix is now quite heavily weighted towards declining businesses. Over time, that mix will shift because of the investments we're making and, frankly, the market shift. So our mix of business is not helping us right now. But we think over time -- take storage, for example. So our Converged Storage business is growing very rapidly. The traditional storage business is shrinking. At some point, the Converged Storage gets bigger than the traditional storage and then you have a growth story in storage. And that actually is a metaphor for the whole company. So it's a financial architecture that actually works in our favor over time. But to your point, we have to continue to be vigilant about cost. We have to restructure our business, we have to make this very large company as lean and efficient as we possibly can. At some of the organizational changes that I announced today, I think there's more efficiency that we can gain from combining marketing and communications. And we need to think through new models for delivering what our customers want and being laser-like focused on that and not doing a lot of other things that aren't laser-like focused about the places that we can win and then how we're going to win there.
Operator: We have Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
Ananda Baruah: I guess to that end, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what the -- maybe a preview, if you will, of what the opportunity for cost savings might be going forward? Presumably, we are going to get market forces that are going to continue to be pretty aggressive across a number of segments. So even if you gave us something anecdotal, that would be helpful.
Margaret Whitman: So listen, we have done, I think, a very good job of identifying areas of cost savings. Cathie very accurately described the labor savings. We have a nonlabor program also in place. And we continue as we are in place -- and consistency of leadership for Hewlett-Packard is so important because you actually have 1 year to the next of learning behind you and an ability to see things that you might not have seen even 2 or 3 years or 2 years ago. So listen, I think there's still opportunities for us in how we support the sales force. Sales operations is an opportunity for us. How we are organized between product marketing and category management and product management, versus what takes place in the field, versus what takes place in the business units. How do we leverage our key accounts? Our big accounts between ES and Enterprise Group. So there -- I think there is a next generation, if you will, of learning how we can be more efficient. You also have to remember, this company was the product of many acquisitions, going all the way back to Compaq, EDS, ArcSight, TippingPoint, Fortify, Opsware, you name it. And while there were many acquisitions that I think were integrated well, not all of them were fully integrated in such a way that we had the right ERP systems, et cetera. So I think you'll see pockets of growth over the next year as we continue to work on this and I think we continue to take out costs.
Catherine Lesjak: And we will talk a lot more about this at our Security Analyst Meeting in October when we really lay out all of the different elements of the fiscal '14 plan and cost -- continued cost-reduction will certainly be prominently featured.
Margaret Whitman: Yes. But let me -- are we done? I think we're ready to close. Okay. So listen, I feel very confident in our turnaround. This is a journey. We have achieved a lot of milestones along the way. And I'm confident we're on the right track. And I am really excited about this new management team and what we're going to accomplish for the benefit of customers, shareholders and employees. So I still think we're on track and things are headed in the right direction.
Rob Binns: Great. I think we're done. So with that, we'll conclude the call. Thanks very much, everybody.
Operator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our call today.

===== 2013 Q2  (2013-05-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, results of HP may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including but not limited, to any projections of revenue, margin, expenses, earnings, earnings per share, tax provisions, cash flow, share repurchases, currency exchange rates or other financial items. Any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations and any statements concerning the expected development, performance, market share or competitive performance relating to products or services. A discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions is set forth in more detail in HP's SEC reports including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including any tax-related items, reflect estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP second quarter Form 10-Q. Revenue, earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including amongst other things, amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first half of our "fix and rebuild year" now behind us, I must say that I'm encourage with where we are. Since sharing our turnaround plan with you on October, we've made significant progress. We've evolved our strategy for the business, we're bringing our costs in line with revenue while investing in key innovations and we're optimizing our cash flow and lowering our operating company net debt. And most of all, we once again exceeded the financial performance we said we would deliver in the second quarter. You can feel the turnaround taking hold at HP. I see it in my daily interactions with our employees and in our product portfolio and roadmap, and I hear it every day from our customers and partners. But, as I've said so many times before, this is a multiyear journey and we have a long way to go. We need to do a better job growing the top line and defending our margins. That means continuing to implement critical programs that speed innovation to commercialization, optimize our supply chain, improve our go-to-market and demonstrate our product leadership across our markets.  In the second quarter, HP delivered $0.87 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, exceeding by $0.05 the top end of our financial outlook of $0.80 to $0.82 per share. Our results in the quarter were driven by better-than-expected performance in Enterprise Services and Printing, coupled with the accelerated savings from our restructuring program and improvements in our operations. For example, we're in the process of aggressively reigniting our channel partner programs, and we're seeing some progress. Since our Global Partner Conference in February, we've already developed more than 700 joint business plans, which will ensure greater alignment and engagement. We've significantly improved the pricing processes, decreasing the turnaround time for quotes by more than 50% in Europe. We've also automated our deal registration process and deployed a new e-ordering portal and quote tool, enabling partners to accelerate deal closings and reduce cycle times for quotes by more than 20% in Asia. You can already see the impact of our efforts to improve operations and execution on our cash flow. In the second quarter, cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion, up 44% over the prior year. I am really pleased with our efforts to improve our cash management. This quarter, we brought our cash conversion cycle down to 21 days, 7 days better than the prior year. As we've emphasized since October, we're maintaining a disciplined approach to capital allocation with a focus on rebuilding our balance sheet. After returning more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, we lowered our operating company net debt position by $1.8 billion to $2.9 billion. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of reducing our net debt by more than $1 billion and nearly a $9 billion reduction since its peak in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. By the end of fiscal 2013, we expect our operating company net debt to be below pre-Autonomy levels and approaching our goal of approximately 0. As we enter the second half of fiscal 2013, we see some macroeconomic headwinds. The economy in Europe continues to be a challenge and China appears to be slowing down as well. We have taken these factors into account in our second half guidance. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. As you would expect in the turnaround, there are areas where we are doing well and then there are areas we simply have to do a better job. In Printing, I'm feeling really good about where we are on this business, as we execute against the strategy we laid out in October. We sustained the strong performance we saw in the first quarter with margins in Q2 of 15.8%, up 2.6 points over the prior year. We're seeing business initiatives like Ink Advantage gain strength in the market, and demand for new products like the Officejet Pro X, outstrip supply in the quarter despite ramping our production 32% faster than we planned. Our focus on the higher-value segments is also paying off. As a result, we gained 2.6 points of share in high-value ink and increased share in multifunction printers by 2 points over the prior year. And we're not taking our foot off the pedal in this business. As the category leader, we're going to keep driving technology and business model innovations that will extend our lead over the competition. In the second half, we expect to roll out our new Instant Ink program, a subscription-based pricing model to help drive usage in the home and small-business markets. In Enterprise Services, the leadership team under Mike Nefkens is doing a very good job stabilizing this business and improving customer experience, as we continue to execute against our recovery plan. Margin in the quarter was 2.6%, within our margin range of 0 to 3%. Cathie will talk more about this segment, but we expect that revenue runoff will happen a bit slower than we initially expected, pressuring fiscal 2014 revenue growth. And we continue to close some major wins in the Enterprise Services. For example, on the second quarter, we closed a 10-year $210 million agreement to support Cambridge University Hospitals Trust in transforming its digital infrastructure. Once the eHospital program is complete, clinical staff will have secure mobile access to test results, medical history and images. This will allow for faster, more informed decision-making that can save lives. In the Enterprise Group, I'm confident in our strategy. Converged Infrastructure is the future. And by building solutions based on HP's intellectual property, we can differentiate ourselves in this market. We are well positioned to capitalize on the major inflections currently underway in servers, storage and networking. In the first half of fiscal 2013, we introduced critical technologies that are redefining the business in each of these areas. But it's not enough to just introduce technology; we now have to help customers embrace it. We are also seeing continued momentum in CloudSystem, and we announced our commitment to bring the power of OpenStack to the Enterprise to increase agility, speed innovation and lower costs. To date, HP has about 1,000 unique customers for CloudSystem. Stay tuned for some new and exciting cloud announcements at HP DISCOVER in June. During the quarter, we announced changes to the Enterprise Group to accelerate this progress and drive greater efficiencies. We are creating a new Converged Systems business unit and merging our 2 server businesses. These changes will simplify the organization, make it easier to do business with us and allow us to integrate R&D resources for faster time-to-market of new server technologies. In servers, we launched Moonshot, a new class of server aimed at the hyperscale market. Moonshot addresses the space, energy, cost and complexity issues that make today's computing platforms unsustainable over the long term. Compared to our traditional HP ProLiant server offering equal performance, HP Moonshot uses up to 89% less energy, needs 80% less space and reduces complexity by over 97%, all costing 77% less. Simply put, Moonshot can revolutionize the economics of the data center. Moonshot will take time to ramp and we continue to face near-term pressure in the hyperscale market, but we are confident that with Moonshot, we can redefine the market to HP's advantage. In the meantime, we'll focus on winning in traditional servers without cannibalizing margins for the long term. In storage, our planned portfolio shift continues. We've had strong success with our Converged Storage and the midrange 3PAR products that were launched in the first quarter. This has been one of our most successful product reductions, and 3PAR has now exceeded the $1 billion run rate revenue mark. In networking, we sustained our growth for the 14th consecutive quarter. HP is a strong #2 player in this market, and our switching revenue now exceeds the sum of the next 5 competitors combined. In addition, we saw our switching revenue grow in the quarter while our largest competitor declined over the prior year. Last month at Interop, Bethany Mayer and her networking team introduced an industry-leading data center network fabric built on the HP FlexNetwork architecture. This new solution will allow customers to double scalability and reduce complexity by 75% over current technology and it will cut provisioning time from months to minutes. We continue to see real traction in this market as customers realize the potential of our products. In Technology Services, we are making good progress on the cohesive and integrated strategy with Enterprise Group and are driving improved customer uptime and customer satisfaction. In software, we saw continued challenges in the traditional IT management business, which was particularly weak in Europe. This was offset by a momentum at Vertica and continuing stabilization at Autonomy. The industry shift to SaaS continued to be a headwind in the short term, but we are embracing this transition in our portfolio with new products, such as HP Anywhere and Agile Manager 1.1. We saw a growth in both SaaS bookings and revenue. Overall, we drove improved operating leverage as margins increased by 1.4% to 19.1%. Our software business is well positioned with key products covering mobility, cloud, Big Data and security. I am encouraged by some of the customer wins we are seeing at Autonomy. For example, this quarter we announced that All Nippon Airways, Japan's largest airline is using Autonomy's Optimost product to increase revenues and improve its online customer experience. Kudos to Robert Youngjohns and his team for all their efforts in recent months. Now let me turn to where performance needs to improve. While HP's new Converged Infrastructure products give me confidence in the long term, we have to do better job managing the transition from the technologies that powered the past to the ones that will power the future. That's particularly true in Personal Systems, Industry Standard Servers and traditional storage. These are highly competitive markets with aggressive competitors fighting for share and we need to fight much harder. For me, this all comes down to our will to win and we are committed to winning. In Industry Standard Servers, we underperformed in both the hyperscale and mainstream server markets. Our underperformance was driven by both market conditions and our own execution. In hyperscale, where we expect Moonshot will give us a differentiated offering, the transition is going to take time. In the meantime, we have to closely manage the balance between margin and share. In the second quarter, we saw single-digit revenue decline as competitors aggressively priced in the market, but that cannot be an excuse. We simply have to execute better. And we're on it; we're moving quickly to revamp business models to give our sales teams and channel partners more tools and more agility, especially on pricing. Given the deal cycle times in this business, we won't see the results of these activities until later in the year. In the mainstream business, while we need to improve our operational execution, we again encountered very aggressive competitive pricing and a weak macroeconomic environment. We stepped away from a number of deals to protect our bottom line and it's clear that we need to take another look at the low end of our product line to better match customer needs and price points. Again, this all comes down to execution. In Personal Systems against the backdrop of dramatic overall PC market contraction, we saw revenue decline 20% over the prior year. These results were exacerbated by difficult compare to Q2 of 2012 when we saw an increase in volume as the hard disk drive industry came back online following the Thailand floods. If you were to normalize the market share results for this, by comparing the first half of 2013 to the first half of the prior year, HP would have held share and gained share in commercial and desktop segments. As I said before, we're focused on improving our execution and driving profitable growth in our Personal Systems business. We saw margins of 3.2% in the quarter, which was up 0.5 point sequentially, but down 2.2 points over the prior year. It will take time to get our margins where we want them to be against the backdrop of a changing marketplace. Let me say a bit more about our strategy in this business. Using multiple operating systems, multiple architectures and multiple form factors, we are moving quickly to produce the devices that customers want. And in this battle for customers, our supply chain and distribution network gives us a key advantage. You will also see us focus on services, peripherals and accessories to increase the revenue potential of our devices. Following the launch of our first Chromebook in February, we launched the new Slate 7 in the second quarter. The slate marries a sleek 7-inch form factor with an ARM chip and an Android platform to deliver a compelling mobile device at $169. Early signs of interest in this product are encouraging. And just last week, we introduced the HP SlateBook x2, the first Android hybrid device with the Nvidia Tegra 4 mobile processor. The SlateBook x2 provides users with more realistic gaming, faster web browsing and smoother HD video playback. Overall, our turnaround made progress in the second quarter. And as we look out at the enormous shifts that are occurring across the technology landscape, I believe HP is positioned well to deliver solutions for the new style of IT and lead in critical markets. Converged Infrastructure built on technologies like Converged Storage, software-defined networking and Moonshot will form the backbone of tomorrow's cloud, and this backbone will be integrated with Big Data security capabilities that will allow seamless connection across the virtual and physical worlds. To lead, we must continue to innovate, get our costs in line with revenue, fix the operational impediments that are holding us back and execute on the strategies we have laid out. And so far, we are making progress. Now let me turn to our fiscal third quarter and future outlook. HP's earnings and cash flow performance in the first half of the year was encouraging, but we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. While we have a plan forward, HP is rebuilding itself in the midst of profound changes across most of our businesses. This won't be easy, but I'm confident in our plans and our determination to succeed. Our Q3 outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.84 to $0.87. Our outlook for fiscal 2013 is $3.50 to $3.60. I was encouraged by our performance in Q2 and I feel good about the rest of the year. So then let me now turn it over to Cathie. Thank you. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. Q2 was another solid quarter where we demonstrated that we are effectively executing against the plan we laid out and we are improving the business performance in some key areas. The resiliency of our business model is evident again this quarter in our earnings and particularly, our cash flow performance. In the quarter, revenue was $27.6 billion, down 10% year-over-year as reported and down 9% in constant currency. Some of our year-over-year revenue declines we foreshadowed in our last earnings call, but there were incremental market pressures during the quarter as IT spending softened and the macro environment clearly did not improve. We also need to execute better in certain areas. In the Americas, revenue was $12.4 billion, down 10% year-over-year as reported and 9% in constant currency. Revenue in EMEA was $9.9 billion, down 9% as reported and 8% in constant currency. Revenue in Asia-Pacific was $5.3 billion, down 12% as reported and 11% in constant currency. Europe continued to be pressured, but we also saw weakness across Americas and APJ. In Q2, fiscal '12, we benefited in Personal Systems from the hard disk drive recovery, which means quarterly revenue and market share declines over prior year are magnified. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.7% was up 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by margin improvements in printing, unfavorable supplies mix and higher average prices for consumer hardware, units. This impact was somewhat offset by margin declines across Personal Systems, Enterprise Services and the Enterprise Group. Sequential non-GAAP gross margin was up 140 basis points. We benefited from a favorable mix, given the steep decline in Personal Systems revenue, plus margin improvements across all segments led by improvements in underperforming contracts within Enterprise Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, down 5.3% year-over-year and up 1.5% sequentially. Our restructuring savings are ahead of plan in some segments, contributing to year-over-year declines in SG&A. R&D as a percentage of revenue is up year-over-year. Sequentially, R&D increased primarily due to lower amounts of the value-added tax subsidy credits that we highlighted last quarter. Our marketing spend was also up sequentially, driven by investments in Printing to support their new product innovation. The company delivered $2.4 billion in operating profit with non-GAAP operating margin of 8.6%, down 30 basis points year-over-year, as improvements in Printing were offset by declines in Personal Systems, the Enterprise Group and to a lesser degree, Enterprise Services. On a sequential quarter basis, non-GAAP operating margin was up 70 basis points. This improvement was driven by margin expansion in Personal Systems, Enterprise Services and the Enterprise Group. The bridge from non-GAAP operating profit to non-GAAP earnings per share includes the following: expense of $193 million in other income and expense; a tax rate of 22%; a reduction in our weighted average share count to 1,947,000,000 shares as we used $797 million in Q2 to repurchase 36.3 million shares. As a result, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.87, $0.05 above the high end of our outlook and a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55, $0.15 above the high end of our outlook. Second quarter of fiscal 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of approximately $408 million in restructuring charges, $350 million from the amortization of purchased intangible assets and a small amount of acquisition-related expense. Moving to the Business segment. Personal Systems delivered revenue of $7.6 billion in the quarter, down 20% year-over-year with operating margin down 2.2 points to 3.2% of revenue. Operating profit of $239 million was again just 10% of our overall quarterly non-GAAP operating profit. Total units shipped were down 21% versus prior year, driven by weak demand in notebooks and consumers. By category, commercial revenue was down 14% and consumer revenue declined 29% year-over-year. We saw broad-based regional challenges and extremely aggressive pricing actions from competitors in the quarter. As Meg said, our focus remains on profitable growth. Given the hard disk drive issues of the prior year, looking at the first half provides a better assessment of the results. This shows that we basically held share overall and actually continued to gain share in APJ, particularly in the growth markets such as China and also India, where we are now #1 across all major categories. In Q2, we improved sequential operating margins in Personal Systems by 50 basis points, as we continued to aggressively take cost out of the system and repurpose dollars to invest in our strategy. Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $6.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year. We see consistent progress in our Printing business as the new products and the strategy we highlighted at our Security Analyst Meeting pays off. Our Ink in the Office products performed well, with the recently launched Officejet Pro X capturing significant interest. And we saw a positive supplies revenue growth of 2%. Operating profit was $1 billion or 15.8% of revenue, up 2.6 points year-over-year. Supplies were 68% of the revenue mix, up from the prior year, driven by toner. Our channel inventory continues to be within acceptable ranges. By business unit. Total Printing unit shipment volume was down 11% year-over-year, largely driven by the decline in lower end consumer as we continue our focus on the higher-value units. Consumer printer revenue was down 5% with hardware units down 13% year-over-year as our focus on the high end of the market and programs like Ink Advantage contributed improvement in our average revenue per hardware unit. Commercial printer revenue and hardware units were both down 5% versus the prior year period. The currency dynamics are having a mix impact. The depreciating yen was a marginal benefit in Q2, but should provide a more significant benefit in the fiscal second half. Offsetting this are signs of increased price aggressiveness from Japanese vendors. In Q2, the net effect of all global currencies on revenue and cost was a headwind for Printing. Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue of $6.8 billion was down 10% year-over-year with declines across Servers, Storage and Technology Services. Operating profit was $1.1 billion and the operating margin of 15.9% was 2 points below the prior-year period with operating margin declines in ISS, storage and networking, partly offset by rate and mixed benefits from Technology Services. At the business unit level, Industry Standard Server performance was not where we expected it to be. Revenue declined 12% year-over-year with double-digit declines across all major geographies on poor execution coupled with continued macro pressure and an intensely competitive pricing environment. In our mainstream business, we struggled with our entry products and saw pressures in the volume and some areas of the value sides of the business. In hyperscale, we faced a difficult compare over prior year, but also saw further weakness in sales to service providers. Meg mentioned our excitement around Moonshot and we are already working with customers and partners to secure design wins. Within storage, overall revenue declined 13% year-over-year to $857 million. Converged Storage products were up 48% year-over-year and within that, 3PAR was up 82%. But the planned transition away from our traditional portfolio, which this quarter included steep declines in storage networking, tape and media, drove an overall decline in storage revenue. Without a doubt, 3PAR is a hot product and our midrange offering announced earlier this year continues to take share and win customers. We need to better manage the declines in traditional storage, but are excited about the ramp and the positive partner and customer feedback we are getting around our Converged Storage products. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 37% year-over-year, driven by continuing secular pressures and the weakness in Itanium servers. Networking revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $618 million or up 2% when normalized for a divestiture in 2012, our 14th consecutive quarter of growth. We expect modest share gains on a year-over-year basis as our software-defined networking solution continues to disrupt the networking landscape. Technology Services revenue was down 3% year-over-year to $2.3 billion. We are driving improved profitability in this segment by building in self-healing technology into our hardware and vetting more proactive maintenance and designing reactive support that delivers best-in-class service in a cost-effective model. Finally, we are also providing new consulting services that help customers realize the full value of Converged Infrastructure. Enterprise Services delivered revenue of $6 billion, down 8% year-over-year. Operating profit was $156 million or 2.6% of revenue, down 1.1 points from the prior year. Through the first half, we are ahead of the outlook we communicated for fiscal 2013. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, some of that is due to delayed account runoffs, and we've also seen good progress in addressing our underperforming contracts. In addition, we improved our cost discipline and accelerated some of the savings that were originally expected in the second half of the year. IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.7 billion was down 6% year-over-year, driven by contractual revenue runoffs and pricing pressures. Q2 saw our largest megadeal signing since Q1 of fiscal '12, but signings were still heavily weighted to renewals. Application and Business Services revenue was down 10% versus the prior year at $2.3 billion as the contractual runoff negatively impacted this business as well. We continue to develop our IT in this space, but need to ramp our sales team more aggressively to capture the market opportunity. We saw triple digit year-over-year growth in our strategic Enterprise Services revenue such as cloud, security, application modernization and Big Data. Turning to software, revenue of $941 million was down 3% from the prior-year period; license revenue declined 23% year-over-year; support was up 12%; professional Services was down 16%; and SaaS revenue was up 18%. Overall, second quarter operating profit for software was $180 million or 19.1% of revenue. The license decline was reflective of some of our execution misses plus market challenges and the industry shift to SaaS. Our professional services revenue will continue to be impacted as we prune this portfolio and focus on profitability. Q2 saw a growth in security and Big Data and we remain bullish about the strength of our assets and the market opportunity we see here. We continue to apply focus to build a healthy and more profitable software business, but we expect progress will take time. HP Financial Services revenue was down 9% year-over-year at $881 million. Financing volume was down 24% and net portfolio assets decreased 3% year-over-year to $12.3 billion. Operating profit of $97 million was up 1.1 points to 11% of revenue. Financing volume was down year-over-year across all regions, more acutely in our services-led business. We were also impacted by lower buyout activity this quarter that impacted the asset management side of the business. We continue to be pleased with the return on equity this segment delivers. Now onto capital allocation and the balance sheet. We had another great cash flow quarter. Operating cash flow was $3.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year and free cash flow was $2.9 billion, up over 90%. We delivered $5 billion of free cash flow in the first half of fiscal 2013, already achieving the full-year outlook we previously provided. We are very pleased with this performance, although note that we do not expect this pace to continue throughout the rest of the year. Working capital was a key driver of strong cash flow performance again this quarter. The cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 7 days year-over-year with improvements across days receivable, days payable and days of inventory. Our cash conversion cycle decreased 2 days sequentially as normal seasonal movement in days payable and days receivable were supported by inventory reductions. During the quarter, we returned $797 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $8.1 billion remaining in the authorized share repurchase program. We also paid $283 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. Today, the HP Board of Directors declared our Q3 dividend; as previously announced, this reflects a 10% increase over our previous quarterly dividend amounts, our third consecutive year of increasing the dividend. Total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $13.6 billion. Our net debt at the operating company level improved $1.8 billion sequentially, now standing at $2.9 billion. We are making tremendous progress rebuilding the balance sheet while continuing to distribute capital back to our shareholders. In Q2, we repaid a $1.5 billion debt maturity with cash on hand and this Friday, we will repay a debt maturity of an additional $1.75 billion. These are important steps in rebuilding our balance sheet. Now turning to our outlook. We remain confident in our ability to manage our cost structure and drive continued operational improvements. In fact, we accelerated some savings across the company into Q2 and this helped normalize our full year quarterly seasonality. We are still on track to achieve the savings targets we previously laid out, but the persistent macro and market pressures means some of our businesses are utilizing these savings to offset weaker performance. As mentioned, last quarter, the challenges within Personal Systems, particularly in EMEA and in notebooks, are worse than we expected.  We are tackling our execution challenges and focusing on profitable growth, but we expect the challenging competitive and market landscape to continue in the near term. In servers, we expect secular headwinds in Business Critical Systems to continue and although our Moonshot launch was very successful, we are not pleased with the x86 server performance. 3PAR is doing well and we will continue to manage the transition of our traditional storage products and we are also focused on accelerating our networking growth. Printing continues to perform well. Revenue performance has stabilized as our supplies channel inventory has come into line and we're seeing the benefits of the strategies we laid out at our Security Analyst Meeting last October. Enterprise Services remains a long-term turnaround, but is benefiting from improved execution in underperforming contracts, overall cost management and delayed key account runoffs. We still expect a runoff to occur in the second half leading to the expected decline in second half revenue being at the low end of the 11% to 13% range previously provided. And we now expect full year operating margins for this segment to be at the higher end of our 0% to 3% range provided at our Security Analyst Meeting in October. Finally, we expect that currency will be a headwind to revenue of approximately 1 point year-over-year in Q3. With that context, we expect full year fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.60. For fiscal 2013 Q3, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.84 to $0.87. From a GAAP perspective, we expect the full year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 and GAAP earnings per share for fiscal Q3 is expected to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.59. Finally, although we don't typically update our cash flow outlook midyear, we think it makes sense to help you understand how we see the second half shaping up. Compared to our original outlook, we benefit from 3 main items: lower restructuring payouts, lower CapEx and a reduced deposit in connection with the customs duty appeal in India. Second half restructuring payouts and CapEx are expected to be higher than we saw in the first half, but we expect them to be below the full year ranges in our previous outlook. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2013 free cash flow to be approximately $7.5 billion. With that, let's open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Meg, you mentioned that the services runoff will be pushed more in fiscal '14, which will obviously hurt top line growth. But just curious, if we exclude that impact, do you still think that HP can get to neutral or positive revenue growth next year, excluding net services?
Margaret Whitman: So Katy, we do continue to believe that revenue growth is possible. I think you have to remember that we are rebuilding ourselves in the midst of some of the most profound changes that I've seen in the technology industry, almost in our generation. And the progress on this turnaround isn't going to be linear. And I would also say that the macroeconomic environment, I don't think is going to be a tailwind for us. So this lower ES revenue runoff will create pressure in 2014, but if 3PAR performs as we expect it will, if HP Networking does, if Security, Big Data and our Industry Standard Server business performs as we expected, too, I think we have a good shot at growth in 2014, but there's no question there's headwind.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just as a quick follow-up, with line of sight to a neutral net debt position, do you feel comfortable stepping up the share buybacks even versus the second quarter run rate?
Margaret Whitman: I think the good news is we will be in the happy position now of being able to do capital allocation across a number of different options. And really, the past 18 months has been solely focused on rebuilding the balance sheet while increasing our dividend and in fact, purchasing shares to offset dilution. So we're going to look at this on a returns-based way. There's the opportunity to invest, the opportunity to return cash to shareholders, the opportunity to potentially do small tuck-in acquisitions that further our cloud initiatives or our Converged Infrastructure initiatives or our software initiatives. So you can be sure that we're going to be disciplined about this and it's going to be returns-based.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Just a little bit more on the free cash flow, considering the difference in the guidance. You had about a $5 run rate in free cash flow or with the $5 billion you did and your outlook, though, for the second half is much closer to a $3 run rate with the $2.5 billion to $3 billion -- or $2.5 billion so it's actually a little lower. But what is the real HP run rate in cash flow? Is it more like the second half, more like the first half or somewhere in the middle? And how should we look at that from a long-term basis when things settle down?
Catherine Lesjak: So Ben, I think way to think about it that it's not really the first half or the second half. It's the full year. We expect that for the full year, we'll get to approximately $7.5 billion. We are very focused on cash flow in this company. We have really changed the whole sensitivity and awareness of cash flow through a lot of education programs and what have you, and you're seeing it pay off. You're seeing it pay off in free cash flow because of the tight management about CapEx. You see it in cash flow from ops because of the cash conversion cycle. I mean, we improved the cash conversion cycle basically 7 days year-over-year. So we're going to stay focused on that and I think that you should then look at the full year free cash flow as a launching point for fiscal '14 and beyond.
Benjamin Reitzes: So the goal is to grow it from 2013, that there's not like a onetime aspect to the first half?
Catherine Lesjak: No, I don't think there's a onetime aspect here. The seasonality in the year is a little bit different. First half had some lower CapEx, lower restructuring payouts than what we had originally expected, as well as some lower cash tax payments that are going to show up in the second half. So the seasonality in the year is a little bit different, but over the long term, our focus is absolutely to grow cash flow.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz: Meg, I just wanted to touch a little more on the services piece. What is your confidence in this planned services leakage events actually happening in 2014? If it doesn't, is it really because of HP becoming more focused from a productivity and execution perspective? Are you able to maybe unwind some of these planned attrition events?
Margaret Whitman: I think, Mark, it's both. I think there is runoff that is lower from some of these big identified customers. We've done a good job of selling into those customers. So we've managed it effectively. I will say we're also executing a lot better in this business. We are managing our cost much better. There is a predictability to this business that there was a not in 2012. And we have built out a management team that I think is very well suited to really taking this business to a whole new level. We have a sales -- a new sales leader in place, a real sort of Lean Six Sigma manager in place, JJ Charhon is doing a terrific job as COO; Christine Reischl, as CFO; and then of course, Mike Nefkens. And the control of this business just feels very different to me than it did a year ago. So I think it's partly the runoff is happening is slower by the customers, but we're also managing it much better than I think we would have a year ago.
Mark Moskowitz: And then as a follow-up, just in terms of the learning points. Clearly, you're having some good success around productivity and execution. Are there any learning points that can be shared with other businesses or have they already been shared, maybe improve execution elsewhere?
Margaret Whitman: So we're working to improve execution across the company, and I think we are, overall, getting better at execution. There are pockets that I hope -- hopefully, we'll do better in. We certainly learned every quarter from our mistakes and we get better. But if you think about fundamentally, we are fixing a lot of the impediments to HP being great and whether that's our IT systems, we're making big investments there and that's paying off. We're making investments in our go-to-market in terms of streamlining and getting the right people in the right job. So we're fixing a lot of the HP impediments that I described at the Security Analyst Meeting. I will say this takes time. This is an enormous organization, global in nature with 180,000 partners that need to be brought along. And you'll recall that in many of our businesses, 60% to 70% of our business go through partners. So as we make changes to the partner program, which we're well over due and I think right on target, it takes a while for that behavior to change. Our big changes in our partner programs went in May 1. So that's going to unfold over the next 2 quarters and probably, actually into 2014 as we change our go-to-market. That will have some impact this year but again, in 2014. So listen, we are a learning organization. There's a lot of best demonstrated practice sharing going on. And then there are still things we find out every quarter in terms of what we could do better. So a little bit of a long-winded answer, but I think we're on the right track here.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I was hoping you could clarify really what your strategy for balancing profitability versus share in key competitive segments like ISS and PCs? Meg, I think I heard you say we're committed to win. Cathie, you said we're going to pursue profitable growth. I'm not quite sure what either of those really means. But what is the near-to-medium-term focus in terms of either share or a threshold level of profitability for each of those businesses? And part of the reason that I ask that is that they're both key drivers, particularly ISS support very high margin, support revenues, which have now been negative for the last 4 quarters, your deferred revenue balance fell much more dramatically than any other quarter, at least that I have, in 10 years of history. So it's not just the near term. There's a downstream consequence as well and maybe you can tell me if and how you think about that as you think about the broader growth and share and margin trade-offs in the near term.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, good question, Toni. So it's a balance, right? You want to gain share, every place you can or are minimize the share loss, but you have to balance this with profitability. And it's a balance we focus on every day and every week. And this quarter, you saw one of our big competitors, Dell, completely cratered their earnings. And that is not sustainable for a company like Hewlett-Packard. Maybe it's what you do when you're going private, but it is not what you do if you're running a big publicly held company that is trying to create the financial capacity to invest in innovation, to invest in our future. And I've said, we're here to set this company up for the long term, not just get through this year, so it's a balance. And I would say in ISS this quarter, we did walk away from deals that were really problematic from an operating margin perspective. Now what the team understands is that can't be an excuse. That means we've got to figure out how to compete. Either our gear has to be much better, we have to make sure we've got the right product design for the right market segment, appropriately featured, not over-featured and we have to make decisions about what deals we must win. And we're going to be focused on the deals that are sticky as opposed to the deals that are strictly transactional in nature that you do one and there's no long-term relationship and the next time they go to market, they don't care whether it's us or someone else. So that's the balance that we are putting in place. In terms of TS revenue, we're actually really happy with the management of Technology Services under Antonio Neri. He's doing a good job, but he's got a couple of the headwinds because as we see BCS decline, of course, the attach rate of TS was very high to BCS. So that's a headwind that he's fighting. At the same time, he's working to increase the attach to servers, to storage, to networking and he is also developing products like Datacenter Care that can be sold to customers that haven't necessarily bought an HP product in that quarter. So it's all a balance, and every quarter, every month, we adjust that balance, but I also think we've got to make sure that we have the low end of the market priced right and featured right. Cathie, do you want to add to that?
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, let me add a couple of points. The first one, Toni, I think part of your point is a really important point in that's that we may well be more aggressive on pricing on an industry-standard server if we're getting attached to TS. And so really, how aggressive and where we might go for more share and take a lower margin will be based on kind of the complete picture and the long-term view of the opportunity in that account. And so it's really, yes, it's very much like the IPG business where we know every time we place an Inkjet unit, we're placing it in at a loss, but we know that over the life of that unit, it's going to generate a positive NPV. So we definitely take that into consideration. And then the second thing, just tactically on the deferred revenue, potentially what you're not -- you don't realize is that there was re-class in our deferred revenue on the balance sheet from short term to long term, so the decline that you see or you're backing into is larger than what is really there. The re-class is roughly $750 million out of short term into long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Can you provide more color on currency? Remind us in short how your hedging strategies work. And then I'm also curious about your comments regarding the pricing environment and what you're seeing from the Japanese, and if you're going to actually be more price aggressive, say, with your laser printers, given you also benefit on the COGS side?
Catherine Lesjak: So why don't I start? So if you look at year-over-year Q3, currency is probably about 1 point of headwind to revenue. For the full year fiscal '13 over fiscal 2012, also about 1 point in headwind. Now that's improved versus our Security Analyst Meeting when it was 2 points of headwind. But you -- you kind of alluded to it, we really need to think about the fact that HP is exposed to a whole basket of currencies. And we have different hedging strategies depending on the competitive business that we're in. And so, for example, in the services space, we hedge longer term than we do on a purely transactional business -- piece of business in the Personal Systems Group. It also depends on how quickly we can pass on changes in currency and pricing. And so that basket of currency and then the different hedging strategies really mutes the kind of the currency impact quarter-to-quarter in our business. From a supplies perspective, the depreciation in the yen didn't give as much of a benefit in Q2. It's more skewed to the second half and mostly in Q4 when we see the big ramp and that's really because of the contract that we have with Canon and the hedges that we had in place at the point of time that the yen started to depreciate. We do expect that our cost savings in the second half are creating quite a war chest for Japanese competitors and we're starting to see a more aggressive pricing. They now have a lower cost structure than they did before.
Margaret Whitman: So we're going to use some of that yen benefit to fight back and I think that's right thing to do, Shannon. So the currencies are pluses and minuses. In the laser business, it helps us in terms of our profitability, but hurts us biggest the competitors are now most cost-competitive because of what's happened to the yen.
Catherine Lesjak: And Shannon, we will also use the opportunity to place a more valuable unit in the market for printers.
Shannon Cross: Okay, great. And I guess, would you assume that you'll be more -- spending more in marketing and such to drive the new Inkjet in the Office initiative as well?
Margaret Whitman: Not above what's planned in the forecast. I mean, we actually knew obviously Office Pro -- Officejet Pro X was coming online. We knew it was a big bet. We also wanted to take some of our contra revenue and put it back into marketing, so we're planning on that. So that's built in to our forecast.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: Cathie, for you, please. Could you -- I want to go back to cash flow. In '09 and 2010, the cash cycle actually was as low as 15 and was ranging between 15 and 18 days. Can you get down to those type of days or are there structural issues as you think about your cash flow that would prohibit you from reaching kind of mid-to-high-teens days? And/or when you're talking about ongoing cash flow generation capability in '14, is it more driven by improved profitability? If you could just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about the cash cycle versus profitability as drivers to your overall cash flow.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So, Keith, what makes it difficult to get back to teens in the cash conversion cycle is the Personal Systems business. Personal Systems, if you look at them as a standalone business, they actually have a negative cash conversion cycle. So that business is growing well and when it's a bigger percentage of HP, the opportunity on just on a mixed basis is to get to a cash conversion cycle that is much lower. So unless and until that changes, I don't think we'll get to the teens. I think 21 days is actually a very strong performance for us. In terms of growing cash over time, it's about growing earnings. It's about continuing to manage our CapEx in a very returns-based manner. And it's continuing this focus within the organization around cash and how every single individual in the company has an opportunity to impact, in a positive way or negative way, our cash.
Margaret Whitman: I think it goes down to also keep the product planning, how many platforms are we going to build to, how many SKUs on top of those platforms? Because the more SKUs, the more platforms, maybe the more customer needs you can meet. But getting the right amount of inventory in the right place at the right time, the more complex it is, the harder it is. So that's why have a real eye on platform minimization. As -- to best -- as best we can, to still meet customer needs.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Meg, you talked about renewed channel momentum and you mentioned improvements in areas like deal registration and turnaround time. You gave some examples and you said it would take until 2014 to really see progress in the top line, but you also talked about aggressive pricing in pretty much all of the segments where you might see benefit and obviously, you're going to be focused on profitability. So I guess, the question is what segments of the business are you most confident that you'll actually see revenue stabilization and market share momentum improve as we head into next year? Where should we be looking for the signs of success that you're doing with the channel?
Margaret Whitman: So I think 3PAR and StoreOnce is going to have a great year with the channel, the second half and next year. I would also say HP Networking. With the new Datacenter networking products that introduced at Interop last week or the week before, that's a perfect channel product, where actually George Kadifa is working hard to improve our software sales to the channel and there's a great deal of interest on the part of the channel. We just had our Channel Advisory Board and many questions were how can we get involved with security, how can we get involved with Vertica and Autonomy? Listen, we hope that it will help -- the change to the programs will help our mainstream Industry Standard Servers. The great thing about the channel is they are very commercial. They want to go where they're going to make the most amount of money and where the sale is going to be the easiest to their end customers. We've tried to be a whole lot easier to do business with, with varied competitive channel programs. For example, starting at paying at dollar one as opposed to a complicated set of gates and hurdles that they have to jump over. And then PCs. Listen, if we have the right product priced right, the channel still loves HP and they want to sell in our product, whether it's to small businesses, medium-sized businesses or the enterprise and frankly, having Android products here helps a lot. This $169 Slate helps cover a segment of the market that we didn't have before. So I'd say those are the things, the first ones were the ones I feel most certain about, and we'll have to see how Industry Standard Servers pans out and how our PC product is received by the channel.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS.
Steven Milunovich: I wonder if you could give some color first on industry verticals? How much exposure, perhaps, generally you have to different verticals and what kind of strength and weakness you're seeing, particularly in the federal government? And then just an accounting question on the balance sheet, accumulated other comprehensive income has jumped quite a bit in the last couple of quarters. What's that about?
Margaret Whitman: Okay. Let me take vertical area. So as you know, we have particularly in Enterprise Services, a significant presence, a good presence with the federal government in the United States, as well as the government in the U.K. and other countries. EDS had a very strong federal government practice, and we are excited about that business. There's no question that the tenor and tone has changed with sequestration in the United States and frankly, austerity in Britain. So we have to be very sharp and very competitive to win that business and we have to come to them with ideas about how they can fundamentally change their cost structure. Because the days are over in the federal government of ever-escalating IT budgets. And frankly, and it's over in some of the big industries like financial services and others. So it's about providing solutions that can fundamentally change their cost structure and get to them to, if you will, the new style of IT. So we are on this. I feel pretty confident about it but we are seeing a lot of pressure on the government side of things, as you might imagine. Cathie, you want to answer [ph] the...
Catherine Lesjak: Yes. On that, Steve, there's lots of puts and takes in accumulated other comprehensive income. And so what I think probably best is for Rob will follow up with you after the call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers from Stifel Nicolaus.
Aaron Rakers: On the operating expense savings, can you just give an update where you stand as it relates to your headcount reduction effort of 26,000 people for the year? And then I think obviously, you talked about accelerated savings on the OpEx line, but can you also talk about the rate of reinvestment relative to what you had said at the Analyst Day event, which I think you had outlined a $0.15 headwind from reinvestment. Where do we stand relative to that at this point halfway through the fiscal year?
Catherine Lesjak: Okay, so let me start with where we are with respect our labor restructuring. We are on track for 26,000 employees to exit the company under our restructuring plan by the end of this year. We had roughly 3,500 employees leave under the plan in the quarter and on a program-to-date basis, we're at about 18,800. And so we are actually probably a little bit ahead of plan, but kind of feel good about achieving the savings for the year.
Margaret Whitman: In terms of -- Aaron, in terms of where we are versus the $0.15, listen, we have -- as we have created that financial capacity to invest. We are protecting that investment with everything we've got because that is the future of Hewlett-Packard. So you can see that investment in products like Moonshot, multifunction printers, Officejet Pro X, SDN, low-tier, mid-tier storage, I mean, the strategic Enterprise Services in Services business. And we're also driving investments into IT, whether it's quote-to-cash or other CRM tools, Salesforce, Workday, we are trying to fix a lot of what has been historic impediments to getting the work done here, and we are protecting that investment aggressively. Now what we believe will happen is that many of those investments in IT, you're going to start to see the benefit, for example, in services. The good news is they now have a labor demand-supply management system, they have a purchasing system that is going to allow them to get more productivity. So I'd say, we're -- I mean, I'll let Cathie comment. I think we're certainly protecting the $0.15 and as we see opportunities, we're making incremental investments to set us up for the longer term.
Catherine Lesjak: So I would agree with that. And one of the things when I was kind looking at the results and thinking about questions that you might ask, it was an interesting thing, I was looking at OpEx because OpEx is down just over 5% year-over-year and up about 1.5% sequentially. And I thought, someone might ask the question, "Wow, your revenue is down 10%, why isn't OpEx down at least 10%? Can't you cut cost faster?" And yet I thought a whole other group of people might say, "Why are you cutting expenses? Why aren't you making investments for the long term?" And so what I think is really important is a, we've got our arms around cost and we've got our around where we think it's appropriate to invest for the long term. So we're not making our EPS based on cost-cutting alone. This is really well thought out, well-placed OpEx dollars. And of course, we're cutting out the stuff that's not generating the returns that are going to help set us up for the future, but we're protecting the investment whether it's in R&D, whether it's in marketing or sales to set ourselves up for the future.
Rob Binns: Time for one final question.
Operator: Our last question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Okay, great. I have an extension of the last question. Prior to giving us the $0.15 reinvestment target at the Analyst Day, I believe when the restructuring program was first announced, you mentioned that the vast majority of the savings would be reinvested and I understand the end market dynamics have changed, so that shouldn't necessarily be the near-term goal. But can you help us to think about how much of the original reinvestment plans from a year ago are being delayed versus eliminated because they may simply not be necessary anymore? And maybe an example or two of where the latter may have occurred?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with -- let's level set. So what we said at the Security Analyst Meeting is that the labor savings would be roughly $2.2 billion in fiscal '13 and that's about $1.9 billion over fiscal '12. We are still committed to that plan. We are not -- none of those become unnecessary. Now they don't all drop to the bottom line either because we're reinvesting or we're using it to protect the weakening performance that we've seen. Then in November we talked about the fact that we have incremental nonlabor savings, incremental to the labor savings of roughly half of what the labor savings were and we talked about the fact that those were more weighted to the second half as it ramps. Now we did bring some of those into Q2 and we are pleased to that performance, but that again is all there to set up, protect kind of the commitments that we're making in the business environment that we see and reinvest,
Margaret Whitman: Well, I think Cathie summarized it really well. I mean, this is -- we have an eye on the short term, but we have an eye on the long term. Because anyone can make this quarter or this year and it's all about setting ourselves up for the products and services and software that are going to power the new style of IT while we manage through the knothole of some declining businesses that, frankly, we're -- the way the industry used to be powered. And it is that transition that we've got to manage through. And it is not easy, but I think actually, we've got a handle on this and I think we're doing a reasonably good job of it. And so -- but it's absolutely critical to protect the investments. And then we can use some of the savings to cover weaker business performance, which we have. Thank you. Thank you very much for joining us and...
Rob Binns: Yes, thank you, and that concludes the call. Thanks very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2013 Q1  (2013-02-21 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2013 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Anthony, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today's call, Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year.

The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations webpage at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we discussed during our Security Analyst Meeting in October, fiscal 2013 is the second year in a multiyear journey to turn HP around. You will recall that I referred to fiscal 2013 as a "fix and rebuild year" that would set HP up for recovery and expansion in 2014. Since announcing our turnaround plan, we've done what we said we would do. We've defined a clear strategy for the business, we've made significant progress in bringing our costs in line with revenues and most importantly, we've exceeded the financial performance we said we would deliver. With the first quarter of 2013 behind us, we're starting to see some traction on our performance as a result of the actions we took in 2012 to lay the foundation for HP's future. While the results in the first quarter were not where we want them to be, we did better than we expected. But let me repeat what I've said so many times before. HP's turnaround will not be linear, and our primary focus is to deliver on our outlook for the full year. That means continuing to implement critical programs to strengthen our balance sheet, optimize our supply chain, speed innovation into commercialization and demonstrate our products leadership across our markets. In the first quarter, HP delivered $0.82 in diluted non-GAAP earnings per share, exceeding our financial outlook of $0.68 to $0.71 per share. This is tangible proof that we have the right plan in place and that we're successfully delivering on it. Performance in the quarter was driven by improved execution, as well as improvement in our channel and go-to-market effort. Additionally, the restructuring program we announced in May continues to deliver results. The restructuring program had a meaningful impact on the bottom line in the first quarter, and we expect that will accelerate as we move through fiscal 2013 and into fiscal 2014. In addition to the financial impact, we are seeing the benefits of a streamlined and more engaged organization translate into crisp execution of the business strategies. As I said before, all this comes down to improving cash flow. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $2.6 billion, up 115% over the prior year. As we detailed in October, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation with a focus on rebuilding our balance sheet. After returning more than $0.5 billion to investors in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the first quarter, we improved our operating company net debt position for the fourth successive quarter by more than $1 billion to $4.7 billion. Now, let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter, starting with the Enterprise Group. Overall, I would have to say that I was pleased with the performance improvements the Enterprise Group made during the quarter. We are driving incredible product innovation in servers, storage and networking that is really resonating with customers who are grappling to meet the complex needs of the new style of IT. Revenue from our Converged Storage products increased 18% over the prior year, which includes revenue from 3PAR that was up 21% over the prior year as we continue to innovate. During the quarter, we launched our most significant set of new storage platforms in over a decade, the industry's first converged storage solution that break through complexities and inefficiencies with a single architecture. These solutions, including the new HP 3PAR mid-tier storage and StoreOnce Backup products, are already gaining traction with our customers. In servers, we stabilized our core server business as our Gen8 product ramped in the quarter due to improved channel execution and better options attach rate. As a result, we expect to grow market share by nearly 1 point in x86 servers over the prior year. In addition, HP ProLiant has been the #1 server brand for 67 quarters in a row with an estimated 32.1% of total x86 units shipment share in the fourth calendar quarter. Networking showed continued sustained revenue growth, up 6% year-over-year after normalizing for divestiture and, we believe, gaining modest share in the quarter. And our Technology Services business, which we are now reporting as part of the Enterprise Group, continued to deliver strong profitability. I was also pleased with the performance improvements we saw in Printing. We grew margins by 3.9 points over the prior year, as new initiatives to drive innovation and implement new business models took hold. We launched our new multi-function printers and document workflow products in the quarter. These new products are really paying off. In the fourth calendar quarter, we saw year-over-year hardware share gains of 4 points in our all-in-one products and 3 points in multifunction printers. Overall, we grew ink share by 2 points sequentially over the prior quarter. This was driven by our Ink in the Office program and by products like Officejet Pro, which saw unit growth of 32% year-over-year. We expect that our recently launched Officejet Pro X, powered by our revolutionary page-wide array technology, will further extend our lead, particularly amongst small and medium-sized business customers. Finally, we are seeing continued strength from our Ink Advantage program, which has now been expanded to over 120 emerging markets. Ink Advantage printer placements grew over 350% over the prior year. Clearly, our strategies are driving our Printing business to where it needs to be. In Personal Systems, against a backdrop of overall PC market contraction in the fourth calendar quarter, we gained 1.4 points of market share in PCs over the prior year, including a 4.6 point gain in the U.S. On the back of our strong execution in the Windows 8 rollout, we once again held our position as the world's leading PC maker. We have really amped up our innovation in the Personal Systems space with a particular focus on the enterprise. We announced the EliteBook Revolve, the first major convertible design refresh for commercial managed IT in more than 5 years. The Revolve was named the Best Notebook at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2013. And we officially released the HP ElitePad 900, the world's first tablet optimized for the enterprise, and we are seeing very strong interest for the ElitePad from current and new customers alike. Finally, we introduced our first notebook powered by the Google Chrome platform. This first step in building out a multiple operating system strategy in our Personal Systems business will allow HP to effectively meet the needs of both the enterprise and the consumer. Turning to Enterprise Services, the new leadership team led by Mike Nefkens has moved quickly to stabilize the business. And with Q1 margins of 1.3%, we are on track to deliver full year margins in the target range of 0% to 3%. The expected revenue run-off in the key 4 accounts we highlighted at our Security Analyst Meeting was somewhat delayed, and we did a good job managing and selling into these accounts. This, in addition to higher-than-expected non-services revenue, meant total Enterprise Services exceeded our expectations for the quarter. It is still early days, but I believe ES is on track to deliver on the long-term recovery plan we presented in October. In software, we saw continued strength in our Big Data analytics business, including high double-digit growth in Vertica over the prior year. We also saw strong double-digit growth in Security, where we have momentum building for the rest of fiscal 2013. Now, as I have said many times, our channel partners are critical to our success, so we are also making significant investments to make our channel program simpler, more profitable and more consistent for our channel partners. At our Global Partner Conference earlier this week, we announced significant changes to our partner programs to address what they want from us: a simplified compensation model, higher rebates or higher specialist designations and new IT investments. They also want more time to use their marketing development funds, and they want simplified sales and technical certifications. In addition, we're rolling out a new platform to improve communications and joint business planning with our channel partners. Of course, the other critical piece to our turnaround is our people. My experience with turnarounds is that they happen from the inside out. If we can mobilize HP's more than 300,000 employees, I truly believe there is nothing we can't do. And I have to say that I am seeing that turn. Just a couple of weeks ago, we brought together the company's top 1,000 leaders for our leadership meeting. The passion and enthusiasm I saw for the future of this company was palpable. And I, for one, walked away more energized than ever. Turnarounds also happen when old and new customers believe: When they believe in the products, services and consistency of their partners and providers. In HP's case, customers are really starting to believe. Around the world, we saw a number of significant customer wins in the quarter, including HP Enterprise Services announced the contract of a  $543 million with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The program will procure and deploy a management system to assist in the automation and improvement of operations and veteran healthcare services. Luxottica Group, the global leader in eyewear, tapped HP to manage its data center environment. HP will work to create a more agile, secure and scalable technology infrastructure to help them migrate to a cloud computing environment. AllDigital, a leading digital broadcasting solutions provider, selected HP StoreAll Storage to support its future business growth, improve its cloud storage performance and reduce infrastructure costs.  Finally, HP was awarded a major contract from the Uttar Pradesh government in India to supply 1.5 million laptops to students in the state. Now, we clearly still face a long road ahead, and there's a lot we still have to fix and rebuild. I donât like the fact that we saw revenue decline in each of our major segments. We are focused on turning this around. That means innovating in our products, improving our go-to-market and implementing new business models. Restoring growth is a priority, and we're on it. We're seeing pockets of progress, but as we said at the Security Analyst Meeting, it will take the rest of the year to embed our plans before we see sustainable progress on the top line. Let me talk a bit more about the Personal Systems business. It's called Personal Systems for a reason. Personal computing is about much more than the personal computer. It's not news to anyone that there are tectonic shifts happening in this market as new form factors continue to proliferate, new operating platforms emerge and the lines between the enterprise and the consumers blur. On top of that, the pace of these shifts is actually accelerating. There are a lot of reasons why we are where we are in this market, but I truly believe that this is a business we need to be in for 3 reasons: First, nobody understands computing like HP, from the data center to the device. Second, the future is convergence. As the complexity of these computing ecosystems go up, our ability to bring pieces together becomes a competitive advantage. And third is security. As these devices become more central to our businesses and our lives, they present greater risks to both enterprises and individuals, and HP understands how to balance access and security. By bringing these 3 things together, HP can win in this rapidly growing market by marrying form factor with computing power to create the secure personal systems that enterprises and consumers need to drive their businesses and live their lives. It is going to take us some time to get back on track, but we've made significant progress over the past year in our mobility strategy, with new form factors that are resonating well with customers and multiple operating systems that are going to give us flexibility to meet a variety of customer needs. At the same time, we are continuing to innovate in key computing markets where we already lead, like workstations, desktops and notebooks, areas I believe will continue to be critical pieces of the computing ecosystem. As we navigate this transition, we need to remain focused on the balance between profitability and market share, but it's important to acknowledge that pricing continues to be very competitive. We plan to continue to take actions to improve our margins in Personal Systems as we go through fiscal year 2013. In the Enterprise Group, we are seeing a tepid market in [indiscernible] in servers, where we have a significant leadership position, and that continues to impact HP. We also saw continued headwinds in BCS and the traditional storage business as we manage that portfolio transition. We have 2 distinct stories within our storage portfolio, with our focus area of Converged Storage performing extremely well while we transition away from our traditional storage products. As a result, we will now be breaking out Converged Storage from traditional storage to give investors better visibility into what is happening with this business. In servers, we are focusing on improving our hyperscale offering. The first quarter represented a tough comparison over the prior year for our hyperscale business, which tends to be somewhat lumpy, but we still have work to do in this market to compete profitably. In Enterprise Services, we have to reignite growth and there's plenty of work to do on improving our sales capabilities. Just last week, we announced Larry Stack as Senior Vice President of Global Sales for Enterprise Services. He is tasked with reigniting Enterprise Services sales. Larry is a seasoned leader who has had a strong track record of successfully transforming sales organizations at Accenture, and actually, with HP before that. I must say I've been pleased with the quality of talent that the ES team has been able to attract over the past few quarters to help them in their turnaround. In software, we saw weakness in our traditional IT performance suite business. We're working to improve our product offerings, business model and execution to address the drop in license revenue. And our autonomy business has begun to stabilize, but it is still a work in process and will take time to get back on track. But overall, our turnaround made progress in the first quarter. If I had to characterize it, I'd say the patient showed some improvement and there are a number of new programs and disruptive innovations that should help us along. Two that I'm particularly excited about are the refocusing of HP Labs under Martin Fink and the launch of our first product resulting from Project Moonshot. You will recall that during our Security Analyst Meeting, I talked about the need to improve how HP commercializes the incredible innovation that is happening across the company. And today, we are rolling out a new vision for HP Labs that is going to take one of Silicon Valley's most iconic entities to new levels. Martin and the leadership team are refocusing Labs to place greater resources on priorities more closely aligned with the business group's future product roadmap, particularly in the areas of cloud, security and information optimization. Innovation is the heart of this company, and we expect this refocus to HP Labs to bring revolutionary new products to market that will change the way we manage, move and interact with information and how we understand the world around us. And later in the second quarter, we will be bringing the latest innovation from HP Labs and our Enterprise Group to market, the first commercialized product from our Project Moonshot. We expect this to truly revolutionize the economics of the data center with an entirely new category of server that consumes up to 89% less energy, 94% less space and 63% less cost than a traditional x86 server environment. This is exactly the technological inflection that can fuel the exponential growth of hyperscale computing. To put that in perspective, if just 10 large web services providers switched their traditional x86 servers to Moonshot, they could save a combined $120 million in energy operating expense and nearly 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 per year, the equivalent of taking over 180,000 cars off the road for a year. That is a game changer. Now, let me turn to our fiscal second quarter and future outlook. HP's performance in the first quarter was encouraging, but we are not going to get ahead of ourselves. As I have said before, we know where we're going, and we have a plan to get there. Now we have to focus on execution. Our Q2 outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.80 to $0.82 a share. Our outlook for fiscal 2013 is unchanged at $3.40 to $3.60 per share. I'm pleased with our performance in Q1, and I feel good about the rest of the year. So now, let me turn it over to Cathie to highlight some of the key factors behind our outlook. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Meg. As you heard, we continue to make the difficult yet necessary improvements to set HP up for long-term success. We are creating new products and services that matter to our customers. We are improving our sales performance in channel relationships and we are recalibrating the expense profile to align with the market and business dynamics we face. At the highest level, I would characterize this quarter's financial results as one constructive data point on the steady, albeit not always linear, progress we expect to make in our turnaround journey. Before I dig into the financials, let me explain some segment reporting changes that we have made this fiscal year. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting 2 new business segments, the Enterprise Group and Enterprise Services. The Enterprise Group mostly combines the previously reported Enterprise Server, Storage and Networking segments with the Technology Services business that was previously reported within the services segment. Enterprise Services then is largely the remaining pieces of the previously reported Services segment, including infrastructure technology outsourcing and application and business services. You should note that there were other transfers to appropriately align all of the TS support and maintenance functionality with the appropriate product and services group, and these have been disclosed in detail in an 8-K we published this morning. In that filing, we have reported fiscal '11 and fiscal '12 revenue and operating profit by segment under the new reporting structure to help you understand the historical performances of these businesses under that structure. Now turning to the results. Revenue was $28.4 billion, down 6% year-over-year as reported and down 4% in constant currency. From a global macroeconomic perspective, there are still a number of headwinds, but we are seeing pockets of progress on a regional basis. In Americas, revenue was $12.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. And revenue in EMEA was $10.3 billion, down 11% and 9% in constant currency. Revenue in Asia Pacific was $5.2 billion, up 1% as reported and in constant currency. The U.S. fared better than Latin America, while EMEA continues to experience broad-based challenges with several major countries down double-digit percentages. Within APJ, both China and India had strong constant currency growth while the South Pacific still faces a tough economic environment. Non-GAAP gross margin of 22.3% was down 10 basis points year-over-year due to the tough pricing environment in our Personal Systems market, as well as margin declines within EG and ES. These impacts were somewhat offset by margin expansion in Printing due to rate improvements in ink hardware and toner, as well as a favorable mix shift towards ink supply. Sequential non-GAAP gross margin was down 190 basis points, driven by seasonal revenue declines in Enterprise Services outpacing expense reductions and Printing margin declines as supplies mix shifted to toner. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, down 1.4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The restructuring program announced last May provided savings this quarter in line with our expectations. And on a year-over-year basis, some of these savings are helping to drive down our SG&A expenses. Sequentially, R&D declined primarily due to 2 factors: First, was the impact of value-added tax subsidy credits in the current period. Second, was higher expense in Q4 '12 resulting from one-time accelerated contract cost. Despite the favorable impact of the current period VAT credit, R&D was up on a year-over-year basis in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin was 7.9%, down 70 basis points year-over-year, and the company delivered $2.2 billion in operating profit. Given the macro and specific business challenges we faced this quarter, the overall profit story came in better than we had anticipated. And while we know we have more work to do, this is a step in the right direction. The bridge from non-GAAP operating profit to non-GAAP earnings per share includes the following: Other income and expense of $179 million in expense; a tax rate of 22%; a 2% reduction in our weighted average share count to 1,956,000,000 shares; and we used $253 million in Q1 to repurchase 19.2 million shares. As a result, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.82 and a GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.63. The non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our outlook we provided at the last earnings call by $0.11 or 15%. First quarter fiscal 2013 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share excludes pretax charges of approximately $350 million from the amortization of purchased intangible assets, about $130 million of restructuring charges and a very small amount of acquisition-related expense from prior acquisitions. Now onto the business segments' performances for the quarter. Personal Systems delivered revenue of $8.2 billion in the quarter, down 8% year-over-year with operating margin down 2.5 points to 2.7%. Operating profit of $223 million amounted to just 10% of HP's overall non-GAAP operating profit in the quarter. Total units shipped were down 5% versus prior year, driven largely by declines in notebooks, desktop units were up solidly this quarter. By categories, commercial revenue was down 4% and consumer revenue declined 13% year-over-year. Europe was a challenge, but we continue to see positive traction in APJ with some of the channel improvements that Meg described showing good results. Our effective inventory management positioned us well to capture a stronger share in Windows 8 form factors relative to the competition this quarter. While Windows 8 was not a significant enough catalyst to stem the declines of the experience, we continue to be excited about our new product offerings being placed into the market. But clearly, the margins of this business are still not where we want them to be, and the top line pressures, in particular with notebooks, are significant. The business is facing a broader market downturn, and we have a lot of work to do to get this business back on track. Turning to Printing. Net revenue was $5.9 billion, down 5% year-over-year. The story is largely consistent with last quarter. We continue to realize share gains in high-value ink hardware and across our multifunction portfolio, and Ink Advantage is doing well for us. Indigo also had another strong quarter. We think the new ink technology we have innovated for the SMB community is a game changer, and we are launching the Officejet Pro X amidst strong customer interest for the product. Operating profit was $1 billion or 16.1% of revenue, up 390 basis points year-over-year. Supplies were 66% of the mix, roughly flat year-over-year. And we continued to manage channel inventory down with dollar declines for the sixth quarter in a row in supplies. Channel inventory is within our acceptable ranges. This represents great progress and is down more than 25% from the peak several quarters ago. By business unit, total printer units shipment volume was down 11% year-over-year, largely driven by the decline in lower-end consumer as we maintain focus on the higher-value units. Consumer printer revenue was down 2%, with hardware units down 13% year-over-year. Commercial printer revenue was down 9%, and hardware units were down 6% versus the prior year period. As I mentioned last quarter, the revenue declines are partly attributable to a shift in focus from lower-end printers to the high-end category, where we have seen success with market share gains. As a result of this shift and our Ink Advantage products, our average selling prices have increased year-over-year in Printing. We are managing unit placement investments to drive shareholder value over the life of the unit. Turning to the Enterprise Group. Revenue of $7 billion was down 4% year-over-year with declines across Servers, Storage and Technology Services. The greatest declines were experienced in EMEA again this quarter. Operating profit was $1.1 billion. And the operating margin of 15.5% was 2.8 points below the prior year period, driven by operating margin declines in each of the business units, slightly offset by a favorable mix shift to Technology Services. At the business unit level, Industry Standard Server revenue declined 3% year-over-year. We continue to see specific weakness in EMEA, but there was solid growth in APJ, particularly in China. In our hyperscale business, there was a tough compare given the large deals in Q1 2012. As you know, hyperscale deals can be lumpy in nature. The ramp of our Gen8 ProLiant servers continues to go well, and we've seen favorable trends in our average selling prices of these units, too. Within Storage, overall revenue declined 13% year-over-year to $833 million. There is a story within a story that is important, so we've added an extra level of granularity to our Storage reported revenue this year. We have talked in the past about the successes in our key focus area, Converged Storage solution. These products are driving the next wave of innovation and capturing the attention of customers. Our Converged Storage products grew 18% year-over-year, while traditional storage revenue declined 21%. This traditional category includes tape, storage networking and our legacy external disc products, such as EVA and XP. As we've mentioned before, Converged Storage consists of products based on HP's intellectual property, such as 3PAR, StoreOnce, StoreVirtual and StoreAll. The new 3PAR midrange offering we announced in December is driving good year-over-year growth in Converged Storage. And overall, 3PAR is continuing to drive year-over-year gross margin improvement in the Storage business. Q1 was the fourth consecutive quarter where gross margins expanded. Business Critical Systems revenue declined 24% year-over-year driven by the continuing Itanium pressures. This business now comprises just 4% of segment revenue and is expected to continue to face growth challenges. Phase 2 of the Oracle Itanium trial is currently scheduled to begin in the second quarter. It is important that the trial proceeds to Phase 2 to address Oracle's breach of contract and the damages and/or other remedies HP is entitled to receive. Networking revenue was up 4% year-over-year at $608 million and up 6% when normalized for divestiture in Q1 of 2012. This business has seen sustained growth momentum, and we're taking share. We continue to work on channel engagement and sales productivity, and this is one of the few businesses where we saw growth in EMEA. We are disrupting the market, being the first vendor with a full software defined networking solution with a complete ecosystem offering. Technology Services revenue was down 1% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. Again, this business is now being reported in the Enterprise Group segment because of its key relationship to the hardware businesses. As we continue to align go-to-market capabilities and expand penetration rates across support and services, we expect that this important business, with some of the best margins in HP, will benefit. The new reporting segment, Enterprise Services, delivered revenue of $5.9 billion, down 7% from the prior year. Operating profit was $76 million or 1.3% of revenue, down 1 point from the prior year. Some of the expected key account run-off did not occur in Q1 as expected given customer decisions to delay until later in the year. We have increased our management discipline in resource management and are making progress in improving the financial impact of our low-performing account. IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.7 billion was down 6% year-over-year, driven by contractual revenue run-off and pricing pressures. Application and Business Services revenue was down 9% versus the prior year at $2.2 billion, and we saw signing pressure in the quarter. Some of the larger account run-off impacted revenue here as well. However, we saw sequential double-digit growth in our strategic Enterprise Services revenue, such as cloud, security, application modernization and Information Management, and we continue to attack the market opportunity in this space. Software revenue of $926 million was down 2% from the prior year. License revenue growth was weak this quarter, down 16% year-over-year. Services revenue was down 8% and support revenue up 11% year-over-year. We continue to see growth in SaaS bookings and revenue. Overall, first quarter operating profit for Software was $157 million or 17% of revenue. To understand the Software results, you need to appreciate the focus we are applying to create a healthier, more profitable business. For example, in Professional Services, we have moved away from unprofitable contracts and have also expanded the Professional Services ecosystem to our channel partners, improving our channel engagement while also expanding serviceability for customers. We are seeing broader market declines in our traditional IT performance suite business, and we need to stem the decline in licenses by better aligning the organization from an end-to-end perspective, improving our sales productivity and shifting more of our business to SaaS. We saw strong growth in both our Security and our Big Data software offerings. We are excited about the healthy pipelines across Security and Big Data and, along with autonomy, cloud and the IT Performance Suite, these key strategic pillars are leading the integration of software with the broader HP portfolio. The integration can be seen in new product innovations across PPS, EG and ES. HP Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $957 million. Financing volume was down 25% and net portfolio assets increased 1% year-over-year to $12.6 billion. Operating profit of $101 million was up 100 basis points to 10.6% of revenue. Now onto capital allocation and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, up 115% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $2.1 billion, up over 400%. Total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $13.1 billion. This was a strong quarterly performance for us in what is normally a seasonally weaker cash flow quarter. At our Security Analyst Meeting in October, we described a potential deposit of up to $400 million to the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence relating to a legal dispute about customs duty. The amount of that deposit has now been determined to be $34 million, $10 million of which was deposited in Q1. HP is required to deposit the additional $24 million in March. We continue to manage working capital well in the quarter. The cash conversion cycle was 23 days, down 5 days year-over-year. All of the improvement was in days sales outstanding and days of inventory. Our cash conversion cycle increased 2 days quarter-on-quarter, in line with normal seasonality. During the quarter, we returned $253 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $8.9 billion remaining in the authorized share repurchase program. We also paid $258 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. Our net debt at the operating company level now stands at $4.7 billion. We improved this position over $1.1 billion this quarter. Here too, we are seeing steady progress. Now turning to our outlook. As we have said before, fiscal '13 is a fix and rebuild year for HP. While we have seen positive signs in our business performance in Q1, there are macro and market pressures that we continue to face, and some of the ES headwinds we expected in Q1 have just been delayed until later this year as customers work through those complex transitions. We still expect the run-off to occur with the major profitability impacts more likely to occur in the second half. The investments we are making across IT systems, supply chain, new product innovation and cloud are starting to bear fruit. But there are key challenges still out there. Frankly, the business deterioration we are seeing in Personal Systems, particularly in EMEA and with notebook, is worse than we expected. For Q2, we expect the rate of year-over-year revenue decline within Personal Systems to increase from Q1, especially given that in Q2 of 2012, we were benefiting from the rebound after the hard disk drive shortage the previous quarter. Our Server business has a particularly strong market position in EMEA, and the economic backdrop of that environment is still dismal. The Itanium challenges within BCS are also still with us. Within Storage, we're getting close to the point where the Converged Storage growth will outpace the declines from the other external disk products. And Networking should continue to deliver as it has been. We expect that currency will be a headwind to revenue of approximately 1 point year-over-year in Q2. With that context, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60. For fiscal 2013's Q2, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.82. From a GAAP perspective, we expect a full year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.50. And GAAP earnings per share for fiscal Q2 is expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.40. With that, let us now open it up for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: There's been an increase in press and speculation regarding the potential benefits of a breakup or more significant restructuring of the company. Can you review how you think about the long-term benefits of HP's current structure? And are you still committed to turning around HP while keeping the core divisions together?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. I'll take that question. So we have no plans to break up the company. And I've said many times, I feel quite strongly that we are better and stronger together. HP, over the last 10 years, I think has put together the most valuable franchise in IT, particularly as we look forward to the most significant change in how IT is bought, paid for, consumed, how applications are going to have to be made more agile. We have a terrific set of assets, and we're going to drive that to I think really great business performance. I mean, over time, the business performance has to underscore the value of better-together. And when you think about our brand, our scale, our distribution, our go-to-market, collaboration on R&D and supply chain, I think we've got a great set of assets. And importantly, customers want this company to be together. And we heard that loud and clear in August 18, 2011. So we really feel strongly that this is better together.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: The better first quarter results and better-than-expected second quarter guidance adjusted earnings in the back half of the year will come down. So just curious, what has changed in your mind? You mentioned greater PC weakness, back-end loaded impact from the run-off of services deals. What else makes you more cautious on the back half of the year?
Margaret Whitman: Katy, I think you captured the main reasons for the comments about the back half. I mean, it really is about the fact that ES didn't have the run-off that we had expected in the first quarter, and that has pushed out. It's also true that, I would say, in the first quarter, the signings in ES were not quite what we wanted them to be or had expected them to be. And as you know, signings earlier in the year mean revenue later -- late in the year. And if the signings come in later in the year, then that means revenue for 2014. So that's a little bit of a challenge that we've got to overcome. And that's about the making the right investments, and they're looking at putting that in place. It's about getting the right sales leader in place. So we've got Larry Stack, who's joined us. And so I think there is some cautious optimism there, but the first quarter signings were a little bit weaker than we thought. Personal Systems business, the market was weaker than we had expected. And we really saw that in EMEA and across notebooks. And so we're really not expecting that the market improves in fiscal '13 at this point. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we do expect that the Personal Systems revenue will decline year-over-year at a faster rate than it did in the first quarter. So we're going to have to watch that very carefully. And then finally, we did delay some enabling investments. And I would say that was probably due to our cautious nature of wanting to see the savings before we go and make some of these investments. And now, we're starting to ramp some of those investments that we had decide to -- decided to delay. And those were investments mostly in enabling, savings over the long term. Things like some of the IT stuff, some of the site consolidation in the Real Estate area. And so we're basically laying those out going forward.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I'm wondering if you can update us where you are in your cost savings initiatives. I think you had outlined previously that you expected labor savings to amount to about $2.2 billion in growth savings and non-labor savings to be about half of that amount, so a total of $3.3 billion. Can you tell us -- and I realize there's some reinvestment there, but can you tell us on a gross basis what you think you captured on a run-rate basis in fiscal Q1 and where you think you are in that process?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. Toni, this is Meg. Let me give you sort of a high-level comment on this, and then I'll ask Cathie to be more detailed. I mean this restructuring program is an incredibly important part of our strategy because we have to create the financial capacity to invest and then to grow. And I would say the restructuring program remains very much on track, a further 3,500 people left the company in Q1 of this year and the FY '12 headcount reduction was 11,800. So we've now asked 15,300 people to leave the company. And while that is a very tough thing to do, we can actually see savings from that and we can actually see a more streamlined and focused organization. And we expect the savings to ramp through the remainder of '13 and into '14. And this is the financial capacity that we're going to need to hit our numbers and also create the financial capacity to invest.
Catherine Lesjak: I think the only thing that I would add is on the non-labor savings, the bulk of those things are really coming in, in the second half of the year. In fact, in some cases, we've needed to make enabling investments early in the year in order to realize them. And we believe that we're still on track to make those savings.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Meg and Cathie, I understand why you want to keep the guidance for EPS because PC just could get worse and the Europe uncertainty. But why not raise the free cash flow target of $5 billion, given the first quarter was better than expected on the free cash flow front? And what are the puts and takes there of that number? What are the chances that could be actually $6 billion or higher and -- as it goes [ph] throughout the year?
Catherine Lesjak: Thanks, Ben. So I'm glad you pointed out the operating cash flow. We're very pleased with the progress that we made with respect to operating cash flow, up 115% year-over-year. And then the other key piece is that we've really gotten the discipline around capital expenditures, and that enabled us to grow our free cash flow over 400% year-over-year to $2.1 billion. Now, we don't typically update our cash flow outlook midyear. And so I'm not going to update it, but I think the best way to think about the first quarter was it was a very big deposit on the year. And there is also the fact that the DRI deposit that we had originally expected was -- could be up to $400 million, came in lighter. And I think this also gives us a bit of a tailwind.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I was curious how you're going to be judging the success of the Officejet Pro X platform. Sort of what benchmark should we look at and how should we think about the potential margin contribution? And then also, how are you thinking about this launch vis-a-vis your Laser line, which you obviously get from Canon?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, so we're excited about the Officejet Pro X. And I'm sure you've read, it's gotten terrific reviews from the industry trade magazines, as well as customers who've had some early units. And this an exciting opportunity because basically what this does is allow ink to move up into small to medium-sized, even to some pretty big businesses. Because effectively, it prints exactly the same speed and quality as Laser at half the cost. So this is the kind of disruptive innovation that we do at HP. And this has been worked on for a number of years at HP. This page-wide array technology is breakthrough. And we're going to drive it as hard as we can. And we're going to measure ourselves by the number of units installed over the next 12 months and what niche -- what kind of customers adopt it. And with regard to Laser, listen, we've got a great Laser lineup. But to the extent that there is cannibalization, that's the natural order of things. And I've said for many years, when there's disruptive technology innovation in a business, better to do it ourselves than have someone do it to us. And of course, ink is margin-accretive to us because we obviously own all of that IP. Cathie, do you want to add anything to that?
Catherine Lesjak: I think the only thing else I'll add is and take you back to the Security Analyst Meeting, I mean we believe that even with our Ink in the Office products kind of encroaching a bit on the low end of the laser, that we still have an opportunity to grow the laser business from a revenue perspective.
Margaret Whitman: And to take share.
Catherine Lesjak: And to take share. So I think that, that -- it's not -- for us, it's not one or the other. We are basically executing in both business domains.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Just on the Personal Systems business. I think your original outlook for the year assumed flat profits. We just saw revenue down 8%, profits down 50%. Obviously, it's a tough market. But, Meg, you sound very committed to staying in the business, and you sound pretty excited about the new products that you're launching. So how are you thinking about the financial profile of this business going forward, given your comments about balancing growth and profitability and given where margins are versus where they've been historically?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, so we are committed to this business. And as I said, we're going to compete on differentiation, whether that is form factors, an increased focus on mobility, a multi-OS strategy, multichip strategy. Frankly, relevant to various industries. We've got great response to our ElitePad 900 that can be customized by industry, and then Services. So the way we've got to handle this is that we have to reallocate resources from the core PC business to mobile to other OS and to services. So while we have to make some investments, it can't be incremental investments. It's got to be moving resources from one part of the business to the other, and we got to continue to focus on operational excellence. And we've made progress there, whether it's fee reduction, platform reduction, supply chain, quality. And this, by the way, has actually been pretty helpful in terms of when we've combined our Printing business with our PC business because we've been able to leverage nodes, logistics, transportation. So I think -- listen, we anticipate that pricing is going to be problematic and quite competitive in the next bit of time here, but we think we can manage that. And I think it -- I think we see quite clearly what this is going to look like.
Catherine Lesjak: Let me also add that if you look at the year-over-year operating margin declines, that was really driven by currency, the weak demand environment combined with aggressive pricing. And as we look out over the rest of the year, our expectation is the weak demand environment and the aggressive pricing stays with us. So it's really facing a tough and shrinking PC market. Broad softness in the PC market, but especially in notebooks and in EMEA. It's more challenging than we had expected. So I do -- we do expect now that on a year-over-year basis, margins will erode. So a little bit different expectation than what we said at the Security Analyst Meeting. We expect weak consumer demand and aggressive price competition to remain a headwind throughout most of '13. And then finally, I think it's really important to understand the impact or lack of impact this business can have on HP's P&L. Just to remind you that the $223 million of operating profit from PSG is just 10% of the company's operating profit.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: I'd like to ask about Enterprise Systems' profitability, please. The profit level of these, even under the new reporting format, has been down for 9 straight quarters. Why do those margins stabilize? Or if you can give us some update on why the business may stabilize in terms of the margin profile, and particularly address, if you can, where you think mix actually starts to stabilize or improve?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, so there's a number of different factors going on in EG, Brian. And the negative ones are...
Keith Bachman: I'm Keith, not Brian.
Margaret Whitman: Oh, Keith, sorry about that. Sorry, Keith. The negative factors, of course, is the continued decline of BCS. It was a big and profitable business. You saw it decline by 24% year-over-year. Traditional storage is declining. EMEA, we have an overdeveloped share, not overdeveloped but a very robust share in EMEA. And when the market is weak, it disproportionately affects Hewlett-Packard. But the good news is we are -- got, I think, the best product lineup we've had in a very long time here, and we are making investments behind that product lineup. R&D is the lifeblood of this business. And as we migrate from traditional storage to converged storage, as we continue to gain share in networking and SDN, as cloud system continues to lead the way in terms of private clouds, we have nearly 1,000 private clouds up now in installation. And as we continue to focus on excellence and operations and TS attach, I think over time, we will see those margins start to turn. But we have to make the necessary investments because this business is now a big chunk of the profitability of Hewlett-Packard. It's a big strategy going forward for us. So we want to make sure that we lay the groundwork for profitable growth in 2014.
Keith Bachman: Meg, just to push you, sorry. Can they hold at these levels for the next couple of quarters, or do you think there's more downside?
Margaret Whitman: I donât -- we're not really calling for more downside. We definitely need to get the growth areas of this business storage -- I'm sorry, Networking and Storage growing again, and that's clearly the Converged Storage solutions growing 18% year-over-year. Those need to grow faster than the declines in the traditional. And we're getting close to the point where those will cross over, and that's going to help us on the storage side. Networking did very well this quarter. Gain -- we expected to gain share. It was up 4% year-over-year. When you normalize for the divestiture that we did a year ago, it's up 6%. So we're very pleased with the Networking performance and believe that this -- for Enterprise Group, it's going to be all about differentiation. We're not conceding commoditization anywhere. We're investing to differentiate kind of value proposition for our customers, and that's Moonshot. That's software-defined networking. That's the mid-range 3PAR product combined with some Autonomy Software. I mean, there's just some real opportunities here for a differentiated experience.
Catherine Lesjak: And I'd say one last thing, Keith, is a big chunk of our go-to-market is with the channel. And we have made a big investment in righting the relationship that EG has with the channel. And we just came back from our Global Partner Conference in Las Vegas, and I can tell you firsthand we're making really good progress here. So if revenues grows, obviously we leverage the fixed cost of the business and that'll help margins too.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.
Mark Moskowitz: Meg or Cathie, clearly it's still early, but your net debt position is improving nicely. Free cash flow, as you talked about earlier, had a really big improvement. I just want to get a sense in terms of an update in terms of how you're thinking about either investment internally from an R&D perspective and/or maybe a renewed appetite for some bolt-on acquisitions? Has your acquisition strategy changed in light of your improving business model?
Margaret Whitman: I'd say for 2013, our capital allocation strategy isn't going to change. We're still focused on rebuilding the balance sheet, offsetting dilution, maintaining our dividend policy and really focused on fixing what we have. The leverage in fixing and rebuilding the assets this company has put together over the last 10 years is simply enormous. Now, you never say never. Maybe there's a tuck-in acquisition that we absolutely have to have to further converge cloud, but it's not in the plans. And then with regard to R&D, we've got a plan for R&D. One of the things we have to stop doing at HP is increasing R&D and then pulling it back. Increasing R&D and pulling it back, so we've got an R&D plan, we're sticking to it. And the initiatives are pretty well laid out for the next 12 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Marshall of the ISI Group.
Brian Marshall: Question with respect to software. Obviously, it's a real key component to increasing the company's competitiveness going forward and it -- only down 2% year-over-year was your best performing major segment. But if you delve a little deeper and just make the simple assumption that Autonomy perhaps was down 25% from where you guys acquired it, that would imply that your core software business is probably running something like single-digit, mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. That's a pretty marked deceleration from what we've seen recently. So I guess question is, do you think that deceleration of growth is going to continue in your core software business? And if not, why -- should we anticipate that turns around?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, thanks, Brian. So our software business is a bright spot there, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our Vertica and Security. These are very robust businesses. We've got a great pipe, and things are going very well. Absent [indiscernible], our license revenue was not where we wanted it to be. And my belief is that that's a couple of things: One is execution, two is sales leadership and three is some changes that we need to make to the product. So I think we will actually turn that revenue trajectory around as we go through 2013 and enter into 2014. But we've got some basic blocking and tackling work that needs to be done in that part of the business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Cathie, you mentioned a bit about the inventory situation with printer supplies. Could you talk about PCs and any other products that you track in terms of weeks of inventory?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So overall, our channel inventory across EG, printers and PCs were all within acceptable ranges. I mean, we feel very comfortable with where we ended on channel inventory. Specifically, with respect to PCs, overall it's good. I would say that on the consumer side, despite the fact that we gained share in consumer, we ended channel inventory a bit higher than we would like. So we are clearly focused on bringing that down a bit in Q2. But I think the real star here is the channel inventory performance in IPG. We have been dogged by ink supplies channel inventory being higher than we would like now for several quarters, and it is now well within the range. I think it's something like -- from the peak, something like 27% down year-over-year, so it's just -- I'm sorry, 27% down since the peak. So I think that, that's really strong. We've had dollar declines over the last 6 quarters, so it's all in good shape at this point.
Margaret Whitman: And I would just add, this is Meg, one of the things we have asked the business groups to do is to limit the discounting to get product into the channel. Because in the end, we have to discount to get the product out. And so we have turned our sales force compensation to sell-through as opposed to sell-in. And this is healthier for us. It's better for the channel, and it's -- I think it's put us in a much better position. It also allows us to continue to differentiate our ink and toner product by substituting what we call contra revenue or discounts to marketing where we can actually differentiate our product as opposed to sort of be on the road to commoditization that I think we were on about 18 months ago.
Catherine Lesjak: And frankly, that's helping to drive some of the average selling price increases across PCs and printers.
Operator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets.
Amit Daryanani: Just a question on the Enterprise side. One on the Storage side. Can you just maybe talk about when you look at the converged, storage revenue is up 18% year-over-year. How much do you think was from cannibalization of kind of the legacy EVA solutions, if you may, versus the new customer acquisitions? I don't know if you can break that down, but that would be helpful. And then just on Moonshot as well, when do you start to see that becoming a material contributor to the ISS revenue stream?
Margaret Whitman: Great. On the Converged Storage, we have put a real emphasis on Converged Storage. We want to sell the new stuff, the stuff that is disruptive in the marketplace. So our sales executives are all about 3PAR, high-tier, mid-tier, StoreOnce, what used to be called left hand network and IBRIX. So I don't know how much is cannibalization versus a real focus, because my belief is sales teams can sell only so many things and we have told them we really want to be in the product that's disruptive. Moonshot grows through the year. We're just taking our first orders now for the first phase of Moonshot, and we're excited about it because of the characteristics of that technology. And you might not be surprised to know that our first Moonshot order came from Japan. And the reason, of course, is that they lost a big chunk of their grid in the Tsunami. And so space, energy savings and compute value at cost levels that are unprecedented, we're excited about this, so it will build through the year. But frankly, it won't hit its real, I think, sort of full potential till 2014.
Operator: Our final question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: A question for Meg and Cathie, just going back to free cash flow. I understand you don't want to update this year's guidance, but given the improvement you would expect in free cash flow for the year, it looks like you're going to pay down most of your debt, probably inside of 12 months. If that's the case in HP [indiscernible] situation you're generating $6 billion, $7 billion of free cash flow a year, can you remind us as to how committed you are to increasing dividends and buybacks?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think you're right. I think we've made a good deposit on bringing our net debt at the operating company level down to zero. So I would expect that while originally we thought it might take us to until the end of '14, that it probably won't take us quite that long. And then we will be back and looking at our capital allocation priorities that we laid out, how we think about capital at the Security Analyst Meeting. And then it's really about what kinds of returns do we get for what different types of investment, and basically going to the highest and best return. We do -- we are committed to returning cash to shareholders, and we do think that, that takes the form of both share repurchases and dividends. Kind of our view around dividends is that over the long term, as our operating results scale, our payout ratio should probably scale as well. Obviously, we stay in touch with our board because ultimately, that's their decision. But we are aligned and working with them to determine kind of what will be the right set, the right mix of returning cash to shareholders over the long term.
Margaret Whitman: Good. I think that's -- it's the last time that we have for the last question. I thought I might just make a couple of closing remarks, if I could leave you with 3 thoughts: First is the turnaround is on track, and we did better than we expected that we would. And so I think that's a good sign. And I said it in my prepared remarks, the patient showed some signs of improvement, and I think we should be encouraged by that. But we have 3 more quarters to go in this year. We feel very confident about delivering the full year results. But we have to deliver and we have to continue to execute as an organization. So thank you very much, and I think we'll end the call now.
Rob Binns: Yes. Thanks very much. That concludes the call. Thank you, everybody.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2012 Q4  (2012-11-20 08:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2012 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is John, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call.

And now I'll turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we discussed during our Security Analyst Meeting last month, fiscal 2012 was the first year in a multiyear journey to turn HP around. We know where we need to go. We have a plan to get there, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal. In our first year of the turnaround, we focused on 4 things: our customers, our people, our products and our performance. We've put a strong leadership team in place, and we are investing in systems and tools that are making it easier for us to manage our business, allocate resources and prioritize investment dollars. This has included the largest and fastest implementation of Salesforce.com, with more than 16,000 users already online. On May 23, we announced a multiyear restructuring program to streamline the organization and create the capacity to invest in innovation. At the end of fiscal 2012, we are on track to realize the savings that we laid out. We have taken steps to refocus our R&D efforts to extend HP's technology leadership in our core markets. Our product and service development teams have moved aggressively to better understand customer needs, to align our portfolio and speed our time-to-market. We recently announced Martin Fink as our new head of HP Labs, and he is focused on driving better connections with the business groups' product roadmaps and speeding the commercialization of our innovations. We are already seeing tangible proof that the actions we've taken in 2012 are working. This is a landmark quarter for new product announcements, including our first new line of multifunction printers in 7 years, an impressive new line of Windows 8 PCs and the launch of the world's first tablet optimized for the enterprise. We also announced the industry's first open-standards-based software-defined network technologies enabling enterprises and cloud providers to simplify and maximize agility across their networks. And we updated our enterprise security portfolio with scalable solutions that give customers the 360-degree view needed to protect the 21st century enterprise. Now cash flow is the lifeblood of any successful company, and HP generated $4.1 billion in cash flow from operations on $30 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, and $10.6 billion for fiscal 2012. To put that number in context, $10.6 billion is more than some of the most respected companies in the world, such as Coca-Cola, Disney, FedEx, McDonald's and Visa, generated in operating cash flow in their most recent fiscal years. HP used that cash to make significant progress on rebuilding our balance sheet, reducing our net debt by more than $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We also returned $384 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. Most importantly, we did what we said we would do in fiscal year 2012. We delivered non-GAAP EPS of $1.16 for the fourth quarter, a decline of only 1% over the prior year, which highlights that the actions we have taken to bring our costs in line with the business are working. For the full year, we delivered $4.05 per share, above the at least $4 per share outlook that we gave in November 2011. We also announced a number of significant customer wins in the quarter. General Motors completed a significant 5-year license deal with HP Software to provide a comprehensive solution, including HP's industry-leading IT Performance Suite, Enterprise Security Suite, Vertica and Autonomy Software. This was a tremendous win and represents the largest deployment of HP Software anywhere in the world. Procter & Gamble awarded HP a significant contract for HP applications development, management services, including our Strategic Enterprise Services. These services will help P&G reduce cost, improve quality and drive innovation. Australia's Leighton Contractor awarded HP a 4-year total printing solution contract. The program includes a comprehensive suite of services, software solutions, supplies and hardware for over 180 sites across the South Pacific. Now let me turn to our business group performance in the fourth quarter. Overall, the disciplined approach to capturing savings from the consolidation of our IPG and PSG groups has started to pay dividends. The Printing group had a strong quarter both in terms of execution and profitability. We saw continued success in our Ink Advantage program which has now rolled out to 82 countries. In the fourth quarter, Ink Advantage hardware shipments grew 98% over the prior quarter and had a favorable impact on margins for our hardware sales. In Q4, we gained share in our focus areas of the printing market, including the high end, with our color and MFP units. As we move into FY '13, we are continuing to drive product innovation in this category with our OfficeJet products as part of our Ink in the Office program featuring our breakthrough PageWide Technology. In addition, our new laser MFP printers are off to a great start, and we expect all of these new products to ramp through fiscal 2013. Our focus on the high-end category will remain, although we are working on the products competitively priced for the lower end of the market. At the same time, we will maintain our disciplined approach to inventory and cost management. In the fourth quarter, our Personal Systems Group faced weak demand and a challenging competitive environment, with very aggressive pricing impacting our profitability. Despite these headwinds, we were able to maintain our #1 position in global PC sales. We also recovered market share in Asia to claim the #2 position in the region with unit share gains in China. During the fourth quarter, we rolled out an impressive line of computing devices with form factors targeting both enterprises and consumers, featuring Windows 8. In addition, we've begun the largest SEED program in the history of the company with the rollout of our new ElitePad 900 tablets to 1,300 customers. As we move into the first quarter, we are managing the business tightly through disciplined inventory and cost management in what we expect will continue to be a challenging environment. In Enterprise Servers, storage and Networking, we have seen continued strength in our 3PAR and HP Networking businesses. This was offset by ISS which continued to face a very challenging macroeconomic and competitive environment that we believe will continue as we enter fiscal 2013. HP Networking once again experienced double-digit growth in the quarter after normalizing for divestiture, its 12th successive quarter of growth. This performance was driven by positive traction in nearly all regions around the world. In storage, we continue to manage the transition to converge the storage products. Once again, 3PAR had high double-digit growth, and EVA plus 3PAR was up 10% over the prior year, offset by the expected decline in Tape. I am really excited about the new products that we'll be rolling out over the next few quarters that will continue to accelerate the growth of this business. Our server business saw double-digit growth again in hyperscale, but this business is putting pressure in our overall ESSN margins. Our Gen8 rollout continues to track positively, although we saw pressures on our pricing and margins as we worked to improve our general execution. We've introduced a number of changes to address immediate concerns, and we'll roll out additional changes that we expect will deliver improved execution throughout fiscal year '13. Finally, we are seeing strong growth in our cloud systems business. HP CloudSystem is the industry's first complete integrated and open cloud platform that enables customers to build and manage technology services across traditional, private, managed and public cloud environments. We continue to grow our customer base which now stands at over 850 customers. In services, margin performance in the fourth quarter was above the FY '12 outlook range that we've previously provided due to improved cost and resource management and improvement in our targeted underperforming accounts. For the full year, services margins were 11.7%, within our previously provided 10% to 12% range. We are making progress on our turnaround for this business and executing against the planned focused areas of resource management, accountability, market coverage and better management of underperforming accounts. We also continue to see positive bookings and revenue growth in our Strategic Enterprise Services business which includes cloud, application modernization, security and information management and analytics. Looking to the first quarter, we expect that headwinds from revenue runoff will impact performance, causing margins to drop in line with the expectations we highlighted at our Security Analyst Meeting. In our software business, we announced HP Service Anywhere, a cloud-based SaaS IT service management solution that helps company manage their IT help desks. Overall, we saw SaaS bookings grow at mid-double-digit rates in the fourth quarter. HP Software also saw continued strength in Big Data analytics, with triple-digit growth in Vertica and double-digit growth in security as we rebuild momentum in that business. Autonomy remains a work in progress as we move this business from start-up to grown-up. There is a big market opportunity for this business, but operational improvements are needed to take full advantage of these opportunities. While we expect these efforts will improve the future of our Autonomy business, we announced today an $8.8 billion noncash impairment charge related to Autonomy. Let me spend a moment giving you some detail about this situation. The majority of this impairment charge is linked to serious accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and outright misrepresentations that occurred prior to HP's acquisition of Autonomy and the associated impact on the expected financial performance of the business over the long term. The balance of the impairment charge is linked to the recent trading value of HP stock. These improprieties were discovered through an internal investigation after a senior member of Autonomy's leadership team came forward following the departure of Mike Lynch on May 23. Based on this information, HP initiated an intense internal investigation into the allegations, including a third-party forensic review of Autonomy's historical financial results. HP has contacted the SEC's enforcement division and the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office. We have requested that both agencies open criminal and civil investigations into this matter. In addition, HP intends to seek redress against various parties in the appropriate civil courts to recoup what we can for our shareholders. I'd like to stress that we remain 100% committed to Autonomy and its industry-leading technology. We will continue to fully support our new and existing customers, and we believe Autonomy technology will play a significant role in our growth strategy over the long term. To that end, we recently announced Robert Youngjohns,as Senior Vice President, a General Manager of our Autonomy/IM business unit. Robert is a seasoned software executive who was most recently President of Microsoft North America. Now let me turn to our fiscal first quarter and future outlook. As we discussed at our Security Analyst Meeting, turning HP around is going to be a multiyear journey and will not be linear. Fiscal 2013 is going to be a fix-and-rebuild year for the company as critical changes to our organizational structure take hold. We will continue to drive product innovation in our core markets; improve our commercialization strategy with a focus on cloud, security and information optimization; and rebuild our go-to-market capability. At the same time, we expect the underlying macro and industry headwinds to continue as we enter 2013. This will put pressure on our top line performance. Finally, the turnaround plan we laid out during our Security Analyst Meeting for our services business will have a positive ramp as we move through 2013. As I spoke about at SAM, we expect to see real growth in each of our businesses in 2014 as they ramp through 2013. This is because the new products and services we're working on will kick in. Our investment in R&D and IT will begin to pay off. We'll have another year of cost management under our belt and demonstrated our ability to manage costs in line with revenues. Our Enterprise Services business will have stabilized and will begin to grow again. And our capital structure will have improved as we continue to pay down debt. We expect that growth will accelerate as we enter FY '15 and beyond. These are real challenges and we don't take any of them lightly, but we're committed to dealing with these challenges head-on and in a transparent way. HP has incredible assets and world-class talent, and I know we can turn this company around. Given the factors above, our outlook for Q1 is $0.68 to $0.71 for non-GAAP earnings per share. We expect the benefits from our restructuring and other cost management activities will accelerate as we move through fiscal 2013, maintaining our confidence in our previously stated full year range of $3.40 to $3.60 for non-GAAP earnings per share. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Cathie to provide more detail on the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you, Meg. I'll review the fourth quarter performance and then close with our outlook. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $30 billion, down 7% year-over-year as reported and down 4% in constant currency. We continue to see macroeconomic challenges in each of our regions. In the Americas, revenue was $13.5 billion, down 6% year-over-year as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Revenue in EMEA was $10.7 billion, down 8% year-over-year and down 4% in constant currency, and revenue in Asia Pacific was $5.7 billion, down 4% year-over-year and down 3% in constant currency. The U.S. fared relatively better than some of the other countries across the Americas, while in EMEA we experienced unrelenting pressure in Western Europe. Within APJ, we saw constant currency growth in China, Japan and India. These are positive signs given the investments we have recently made to improve our market position in the region. Non-GAAP gross margin of 24.2% was up 90 basis points year-over-year as favorable software mix and the increases in Printing margins more than covered the competitive pricing environment for PCs and servers. The 80-basis-point sequential improvement in gross margins was driven by improved services margins combined with favorable software mix, partially offset by continued competitive pricing for PCs and servers. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.1 billion, down 5% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The restructuring program announced in May provided savings this quarter, in line with our expectations, and some of these savings are helping drive down our SG&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 10.4%, up 70 basis points year-over-year, and the company delivered $3.1 billion in operating profit. The bridge from non-GAAP operating profit to non-GAAP earnings per share includes the following: other income and expense of $188 million in expense; a tax rate of 22%, a 2% reduction in our weighted average share count to 1,967,000,000 shares; and we used $124 million in Q4 to repurchase 7.6 million shares. As a result, we delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.16 and a GAAP loss per share of $3.49. Fourth quarter fiscal 2012 GAAP loss per share includes after-tax costs of approximately $4.65 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets and restructuring charges. For fiscal year 2012, non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.05, above the outlook of at least $4 that we provided as we began the fiscal year. GAAP full year EPS was a loss of $6.41, which included noncash impairment write-downs to goodwill and purchased intangibles of $9.14 and other adjustments to GAAP results. Note there is a detailed bridge in the earnings deck posted on the HP Investor Relations website. Before I go into the segment details, let me quantify the components of the Autonomy write-down Meg just mentioned. Of the $8.8 billion noncash write-down, over $5 billion is related to accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations that occurred prior to HP's acquisition of Autonomy and the associated impact on the financial performance of the business over the long term. The balance of the write-down is linked to the recent trading of HP stock. Now turning to our business segments. Personal Systems delivered revenue of $8.7 billion in the quarter, down 14% year-over-year, with an operating margin of 3.5%. Total units shipped were down 12% year-over-year in total and across both notebooks and desktops as we saw weakness in both consumer and commercial sectors. By category, Commercial revenue was down 13% year-over-year and Consumer revenue declined 16% year-over-year. The margin contraction is indicative of the challenging market and pricing environment we face. In the quarter, we saw specific pressures as our competition cleared out their excess Windows 7 inventory ahead of the Windows 8 launch. We feel good about our Windows 8 inventory, and the overall inventory story for Personal Systems was good in Q4. We have work to do to get the margins of this business back to where we want them. As we have discussed before, we are focusing on getting the right products out to market with the appropriate number of SKUs, and we need to drive these through our first-class supply chain. We expect our progress to ramp as we move through fiscal '13. Turning to printing. Net revenue of $6.1 billion, down 5% year-over-year. We again realized share gains in high-value ink hardware and across our multifunction portfolio, and as Meg mentioned, we are also seeing positive momentum in our Ink Advantage program. Operating profit of $1.1 billion was up 5.1 points year-over-year to 17.5% of revenue. Supplies were 66% of the mix, up 3 points year-over-year, and within the supplies mix, we benefited this period from the favorable proportion of ink supply sales. Additionally, Printing operating margins benefited this quarter from favorable currency hedging impacts that we don't expect to continue as we move into fiscal '13. The business did a good job of managing channel inventory, with supplies down in dollar terms for the fifth quarter in a row. Overall channel inventory levels are within our acceptable ranges. Specifically with ink supplies channel inventory though, we will be continuing to reduce the levels, and we expect the total supplies mix of revenue to decrease in Q1 accordingly. By business unit, total printer unit shipment volume was down 20% year-over-year, largely driven by the decline in Consumer as we maintain focus on the higher-value units. Consumer printer revenue was down 14% year-over-year, with hardware units down 22%. Commercial printer revenue was down 13%, and hardware units were down 15% year-over-year. The Consumer results are largely driven by our focus on units that carry a positive lifetime return. Within the Commercial space, we are excited about new product offerings we are introducing to the market, particularly with respect to the new MFP lineup. In addition, we had a record quarter for Indigo in our graphics business, and our managed print services saw healthy device and printed page growth. Moving on to services. In the fourth quarter, services delivered revenue of $8.7 billion, down 6% from the prior year and down 3% in constant currency. Operating profit of $1.2 billion was 14.2% of revenue, up 1.1 points from the prior year. In the quarter, we saw benefits from our restructuring program, as well as normal Q4 seasonal increases in profit associated with project milestones. We continue to see strong sequential growth in our Strategic Enterprise Services, which includes cloud, application modernization, security and information management and analytics. IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.7 billion was down 6% year-over-year as we continue to scrutinize new deals and renewals for margin and strategic fit. Application and Business Services revenue was down 7% year-over-year at $2.4 billion. Although revenue was down, we are seeing improvements in our ABS signings both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Technology Services revenue was down 4% year-over-year to $2.6 billion, largely impacted by the declines in hardware. With MTS, we are driving penetration rate increases within storage, networking and Industry Standard Server offerings. As discussed at SAM, beginning in fiscal '13, we will be reporting Technology Services together with ESSN as part of a newly formed segment called the Enterprise Group. IT Outsourcing and ABS will be reported within the new Enterprise Services segment. Turning to Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking. Revenue of $5.1 billion was down 9% year-over-year, impacted by declines in servers and storage overall, with particular softness in EMEA. Operating profit was $423 million, and the operating margin of 8.3% was 4.5 points below the prior year period. Margin pressure was driven by a weak demand environment and a very aggressive pricing backdrop. Now let's dive into ESSN performance by business. In storage, the sustained strong performance of 3PAR was close to 60% growth, and StoreOnce, with double-digit growth, was impressive. Combined, 3PAR and EVA was up 10%. Overall, we are seeing a good mix shift towards our converged storage products based on our own intellectual property. This is a planned transition we have been executing for several quarters. But these growth areas were not enough to offset the declines in EVA, storage networking and tape revenue. As a result, total storage revenue was down 13% year-over-year. Overall, business-critical systems revenue declined 25% year-over-year. Within BCS, mission-critical x86 was up over 25%, but the BCS performance was again impacted by the persistent Itanium revenue decline. Industry Standard Server revenue declined 7% year-over-year, with particular weakness in EMEA. Networking revenue was up 7% year-over-year at $635 million or up 11% when normalized for a divestiture in Q1. We expect to maintain positive traction in this business as China and EMEA are showing strong growth. Software revenue of $1.2 billion was up 14% from the prior year period. License revenue was up 9% year-over-year, and support and services each saw strong growth at 9% and 48%, respectively. And we had our largest SaaS bookings quarter in history. Overall, fourth quarter operating profit for software was $318 million or 27% of revenue. As we announced in October, General Motors made a decision to largely in-source its IT operating model. In conjunction with this, General Motors announced a new multiyear project services and software contract with HP. This was a significant deal in our Q4 software result as it represented the largest customer deployment of HP Software in the world. HP Financial Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year at $966 million. Financing volume was down 11%, and net portfolio assets increased 3% year-over-year to $12.8 billion. Operating profit of $104 million was up 50 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% of revenue. For the full year, the HP Financial Services return on equity was 17%. Now on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion, up 69% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $3.5 billion. Total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $11.8 billion. For the year, we generated $10.6 billion of operating cash flow and $7.5 billion of free cash flow. Improving working capital has been a focus area for us, and I'm pleased with the results this quarter. The cash conversion cycle was 21 days, down 5 days year-over-year and 6 days sequentially. Inventory and accounts payable were sequential drivers of improvement, while we saw improvements across the board on a year-over-year basis. During the quarter, we returned $124 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $9.2 billion remaining in the authorized share repurchase program. We also paid $260 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. As we entered fiscal '12, we discussed how we'll be disciplined in capital allocation to begin rebuilding our balance sheet. We stayed true to our word. M&A activity has been minimal and share repurchases have been in line with guidance. At the same time, we still were able to distribute $2.6 billion of capital in fiscal '12 to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and improve our net debt position by $3.1 billion sequentially in Q4 and $5.6 billion through the year. On an operating company basis, our net debt position stands at $5.8 billion at the end of Q4. We are pleased with our progress in getting our balance sheet in a stronger position, and we will stay focused on reducing our operating company gross and net debt balances in fiscal '13. Now turning to our outlook. We laid out the details of our fiscal '13 assumptions at our Security Analyst Meeting, and we're still comfortable with what we shared. Fiscal '13 will be a year of fix and rebuild for HP. The macro-environment we described to you 6 weeks ago has been further substantiated since we last spoke, and we continue to see a very difficult backdrop as we move through the early part of fiscal '13. We have to continue the work to improve our operational execution, including renewed focus on working with our channel partners, which will take some time to show up in our performance. While we saw favorable profit results across some of the segments in Q4, we see headwinds as we move into Q1. We don't expect those Printing margins to stay where they were in Q4 as we move into Q1 as we work to adjust our ink supply inventory levels, and we also do not expect similar hedging gains to those that we saw in Q4. In Enterprise Services, as we talked about at SAM, we are facing exceptional account runoff in the first half of fiscal '13, and we expect a sequential decline in operating margins in excess of normal seasonality. While we are optimistic about the new innovative designs we have launched in Personal Systems, the market conditions and acute pressures in the consumer space do not seem to be abating. And our server business continues to face tough macro and pricing pressures, particularly as we see the Itanium challenges within BCS persisting. We have previously discussed key areas of operational focus such as supply chain, SKU simplification, business process reengineering and real estate. We expect the savings associated with these actions will be roughly half the labor savings from our previously announced workforce restructuring efforts in fiscal '13. We expect the benefits of these actions to be significant in the second half of '13. We expect that currency will be a headwind to revenue of approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year in Q1. With that context, we continue to expect full year fiscal 2013 non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.60. For fiscal 2013 Q1, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.68 to $0.71. From a GAAP perspective, we continue to expect full year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.30, and GAAP earnings per share for fiscal Q1 is expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.37. With that, now let's open up for questions.
Rob Binns: Operator, if you could open the line for questions, that'd be great.
Operator: ;[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: Meg, with regard to the Autonomy situation, we understand what you're doing in terms of going after the folks that you feel misled you, but what about internally? What do you -- who's responsible internally for the acquisition? How are you analyzing yourself internally? The board -- I think everybody at the board was there when the Autonomy decision was made, except for Mr. Whitworth. So what's the introspective? What are you doing internally to make sure that you have the right processes? And who are you holding accountable internally, if anyone, to make sure this doesn't happen again and that maybe even there are some folks internally that need to be held responsible and we could see repercussions of this in the near future? How are you looking at it internally?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, well, first of all, the CEO at the time and the head of strategy who led this deal are both gone, LÃ©o Apotheker and Shane Robison. With regard to the board, you're right. Most of the board was here and voted for this deal, and we feel terribly about that. What I will say is the board relied on audited financials, audited by Deloitte, not brand x accounting firm but Deloitte. And by the way, during our very extensive due diligence process, we hired KPMG to audit Deloitte, and neither of them saw what we now see after someone came forward to point us in the right direction. That said, obviously, we have not done any big acquisitions, and we will review the acquisition process. What I will say is due diligence now reports to our Chief Financial Officer. At the time, when I came to the company, I was surprised to find that due diligence and M&A reported to strategy as opposed to the Chief Financial Officer. I've never seen that before in my career, and that's a decision I made right away before I knew any of this. So I understand your point of view, and we have made a few changes in that regard. But in the end, you have to rely on audited financials and we did, and we will now carry on. And as you know, we've reported this to the SEC, as well as to the Serious Fraud Office, and we will take it from here.
Benjamin Reitzes: And in terms of internal personnel, though, based on what you see right now, the organization is -- can remain stable based on this occurrence?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, it can. I mean, really, the 2 people that should have been held responsible are gone, and that's the way I see it right now. So I feel good about the sort of the stability of leadership.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Can you give us a bit more color on what levels of restructuring savings you were able to capture this quarter? And in particular, which segments did the savings benefit most? As I imagine, you didn't have much ability to reinvest yet. And how should we think about the reinvestment plans, in particular, as we go into the first quarter and then as we get through fiscal 2013?
Catherine Lesjak: So in terms of kind of which businesses benefited most, I think all of our businesses benefited to some extent in fiscal '12 from the restructuring efforts. Clearly, services, that is such a -- has a heavy component to labor to it, probably had the absolute dollar biggest savings from the restructuring efforts. In terms of kind of the total magnitude, I think we laid it out in our earnings call last quarter. We basically talked about kind of $0.05 to $0.10 worth of savings in fiscal '12.
Margaret Whitman: I'd add one thing to that. I think one thing we've been very pleased with is the merger, if you will, between our printing business and our Personal Systems Group. This has simplified our go to market. We now have one decision maker in many countries for both our printing and our PC business. The customers are the same. The channel partners are the same, and we have received a lot of savings and a lot more effective go to market here, and we continue to see that go forward. In terms of investments, we are very focused on product, product, product. Great companies return to greatness on the basis of product, and we're excited about our overall product lineup, whether that be our Gen8 servers and our Moonshot servers or our new securities portfolio or our new line of PCs or printers or services. And so the majority of incremental investment will go into making those products great and into R&D.
Catherine Lesjak: And then the other piece of the investment is really setting us up for some of the non-labor savings that I laid out in my prepared remarks around SKU reduction, business process reengineering, real estate and supply chain. And so some of that is more in investment mode at the early part of fiscal '13 but does ramp in the latter half of '13.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have a question and a clarification, please. On the question, I was wondering, if I look at your guidance, you're guiding for sequential decline in EPS of 40% for fiscal Q1. Historically, in the last 15 years, you've only been down more than 10% once and you've never been down more than 23% sequentially. So you don't -- typically, you're kind of flattish sequentially on a revenue basis or slightly down. So I'm wondering, given that your savings actually should be ramping from your restructuring, I understand some of the competitive headwinds that -- and headwinds you outlined, the financial headwinds in terms of both supplies and ISS, but it's really hard to get the math there. So maybe you can shed a little bit more color on why the dramatic erosion in profitability for Q1 and what else underpins that.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, Tony, let me take a crack at that, and I'll turn it over to Cathie. So the way I look at 2013 is we have a probably weaker-than-normal seasonality in the first half and stronger in the second half. Obviously, the second half is always stronger, but you're going to see the restructuring kick in, in the second half in terms of both labor and non-labor savings. Enterprise Services, the biggest runoff in these accounts, is actually in the first and second quarter, so you're going to see a disproportionate effect there. In terms of our new products, many of those products are introduced -- being introduced now, so you'll see them really start to hit in Q3 and Q4. And some major hedging gains came off in the first quarter, so that's why you see some of the bigger difference than you referenced. So you obviously do see a second half that's going to be gaining strength. Listen, we've looked into this very carefully. I still feel very comfortable about our full year guidance, but we've got some headwinds in the first quarter, some of which are out of our control like the hedging gains coming off.
Catherine Lesjak: Let me add just a couple of more comments to that. So in terms of the quarter-on-quarter decline in revenue, we've got the normal seasonality that brings it down, but then we had some extraordinary items such as the ES runoff that Meg referenced. But also, if you look at kind of what we experienced in the macroeconomic environment over the course of Q4, it actually came down over the course of Q4. So our guidance basically says it stays roughly at where it exited Q4, which is driving quarter-on-quarter declines in revenue. We're continuing to see a very competitive pricing environment, and we're continuing to see lower-than-normal revenue from our Itanium situation. In addition, I mentioned in my prepared remarks the fact that we had a very significant software deal from General Motors and Software that just simply is not going to repeat at nearly that level. And then finally, I'll mention that we do have to reset our incentive compensation plans given our new plan, and that puts upward pressure on costs from Q4 to Q1.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. If I could just follow up on the workforce restructuring question from before, so you said that there would be up to 29,000 jobs expected to be eliminated. 11,500 would be gone by the end of fiscal '12, implying almost 8,000 in fiscal Q4. Can you confirm that you received that? Are you still expecting 26,000 employees to depart by the end of fiscal '13? And I guess if statements are true, 11 -- 8,000 people coming out in Q4 should have a significant sequential benefit in the first half of the year and why is that not being mentioned? And you also said that you'd be getting about 50% incremental non-labor savings. I think your gross savings that you had outlined were $0.80, so -- in savings, so are you assuming another $0.40? We should be thinking about another $0.40 in non-labor savings going forward?
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, there are a lot of questions in there, and I could answer yes, yes, non-labor's back-end loaded, but let me be a little bit more helpful in that. So yes, we did get the headcount reductions that we were expecting exiting fiscal '12 of roughly 11,500. Yes, we are still expecting 29,000. Yes, we expect that by the end of fiscal '13, we will go down 26,000 people. Now one of the things you have to keep in mind is that when you -- we execute programs for labor reductions outside the United States, they take significantly longer time to complete, and that's why a lot of the additional savings in labor is back-end loaded for us. And then from a non-labor perspective, what we're really seeing is that we've got to make these -- some of these are making investments in the front end of '13. We call them enabling investments that then pay off or start to pay off towards the end of '13.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kathryn Huberty from Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: In the fiscal '13 EPS bridge, you had highlighted an assumption of roughly flat PC earnings and growing IPG earnings, so question is in light of the low PC operating margin, operating profit dollars were down almost 50% year-on-year in the fourth quarter and the over earning from the ink supplies in the back half of fiscal '12, which will be tough comp next year, if you're still comfortable in flat to growing earnings in those 2 businesses? And if there ends up being risk on that front, what factors can you use to offset that as you move through fiscal '13?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me take that. So as we look at this, we're still comfortable with those estimates. Although I will say the PC situation is pretty challenging right now. And of course, the way we're managing this business is -- the good news about the PC business, it is almost at 80% variable cost, so it is not a high fixed cost business. So if there are discontinuities in the revenue, we can recover from that to quite a large degree. But we also will look across the portfolio between our printing business as well as our PC business, which is now all run as one business under Todd Bradley called PPS, to make sure that we deliver the operating income as we look across the whole portfolio. So listen, we're conscious of the pressure on the PC business. We're optimistic in that we have some great new products coming. We're optimistic about Windows 8. We're very optimistic about our ElitePad 900 which is the first tablet designed for the enterprise, but also conscious that we may have to manage that business as a whole to deliver the operating income that we expect.
Catherine Lesjak: And then the other thing I'd add is that a significant portion of the non-labor savings, when you think about SKU simplification and supply chain optimization, benefits both PCs as well as printers. So I think that we do have some levers, additional levers to manage our cost. And in the PC business as well as in the printing business, it really is about managing your operational cost day in and day out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Yes, Cathie, could you talk about what specifically drove the 25% sequential decline in enterprise hardware profitability. Looked like revenue was flat. I don't think I can remember a quarter with such a dramatic decline in enterprise margins, and your product mix actually looked slightly favorable on a sequential basis. So was all of this pricing? And why wouldn't your enterprise assumptions for your FY '13 waterfall be at risk given these results?
Catherine Lesjak: So a lot of the softness in the operating margins really came from lower top line growth, driven by soft macro demand, as well as a very aggressive pricing environment, especially in Europe. But also, what's putting pressure on margins is the continued decline in Business Critical Systems related to Itanium and the fact that our hyperscale business is growing very well. But as we talked about, I think, on the last call, hyperscale margins are materially different than the industry standard average. So when you -- I think one of the things we need to think about is how we look at this business on a longer-term basis because we're really investing in the large growing and more profitable market segments like storage and networking, and that's helping to offset, over time, the Business Critical Systems decline and really getting then the mix effects from that and also the fact that we're coming out with what we consider pretty disruptive products in the hyperscale space, specifically related to our Moonshot product, which really helps us change the economics for ourselves, as well as the value proposition for our customers for hyperscale. And so over the long term, we do expect these dynamics to help bring margins back up.
Margaret Whitman: The only other thing I'd add to that Brian -- this is Meg -- is that one of the things we got to focus on is our mainstream Industry Standard Server business, which is the weak spot here, and we are doing a whole host of work around our channel relationships in that business, around supply chain improvements, reconfiguring some of the products to be more affordable to certain segments of the market. And I think Dave Donatelli has got an excellent plan in place, and he and his organization are going to execute against that in the first half. And I think you'll see some improvements in the second half.
Catherine Lesjak: And I think the only other thing I'd add to that is that from an investment perspective, in terms of R&D, this is one of the key areas where we are putting real dollars into R&D and are sustaining that. And so this kind of goes back to Meg's comment in her prepared remarks around the fact that this is not necessarily going to be a linear year, and we are going to sustain the right level of investment to set HP up for the long term, and part of that really shows up in the ESSN group.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Marshall from ISI Group.
Brian Marshall: If you look -- I guess a question with respect to guidance, if you take the guidance, the midpoint for the quarter about $0.70, you take that as a percent of the fiscal year total, $3.50 at midpoint, that's 20% Q1 represents for the entire fiscal year. When you look at a previous 3 fiscal years, Q1 as a percent of the fiscal year is averaging about 25%. So what gives you the confidence for the following 3 quarters of the fiscal year that, that'll actually come up? And if you can get a little bit more granular with respect to the segments, that would be helpful as well. I guess the question is, why aren't we lowering the fiscal year guidance with Q1 coming down there?
Catherine Lesjak: It really all comes down to our view of the second half. So we definitely see that the second half per normal seasonal trends is higher than the first half, and we're seeing that is skewed even more as a result of the restructuring programs that we've talked about and the fact that, again, the non-U.S. programs ramp later in fiscal '13, the non-labor components around SKU reduction, the supply chain simplification, business process reengineering and real estate also have the investments on the front end and are starting to pay off in the second half of '13. And then you really got to take into consideration the key contract runoff, which is exceptional in Enterprise Services in the first half, the fact that we believe Autonomy will ramp more in the second half, that we're making adjustments to channel inventory in the first half. And then finally, it's really about all of our new products that are coming in, and the fact of the matter is that they don't really get significant traction until the second half of the year. And we've got a number of new products, whether that's the different form factors that we've got leveraging Win 8, the new lineup of multifunction printers, the ink in the office, taking ink in the office higher into the office with our new Officejet Pro X product, that doesn't ship until February. So all of these are really contributing to a very different profile in the year from a revenue and profit perspective.
Margaret Whitman: And let me just add, obviously, when we gave guidance for Q1, we knew this was going to be a question, so we went through in quite some detail looking quarter-by-quarter, product by product, business by business, channel partner by channel partner, top 250 customer by 250 customer and feel comfortable around the $3.40 to $3.60. So I guess would add that is we understand what your concern is, but we feel good about our $3.40 to $3.60 estimate.
Operator: Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich from UBS.
Steven Milunovich: Could you talk a bit more about the printer business? And specifically last quarter, the margins were somewhat surprisingly high, I think, because you had more Inkjet sell-in than sell-through. So we sort of expected they might come down this quarter, and obviously, they did the opposite. So maybe you can talk a bit more about what were the contributors to that and how much maybe the hedging thing was and so forth. And also, are you concerned with the reduction in the hardware units, at this kind of a pace that it's going to have a lag effect on supplies? And how long does that lag typically take?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with kind of the specifics around the year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter improvements in the operating margins, and then maybe Meg can take on the question around the hardware units and where we're focusing. So from a year-on-year and sequential perspective, the margin improvement really came from higher supplies mix, and the mix within supplies is shifted a bit more to ink. We also have a lower mix of low-value hardware, so we really are focusing on higher-value hardware, which is driving ASPs up. And then finally, we're really -- we're benefiting from disciplined cost management, and part of that is just a maniacal focus on cost and the restructuring benefits. And then the other piece is just bringing the IPG and PSG groups together. It really has given us the kind of leverage that we had hoped for when Meg made the decision to bring the 2 groups together.
Margaret Whitman: With regard to hardware -- so let me take the ink hardware first -- one of the things that we discovered in the last 12 months is that there's a very distinct segmentation between high-end hardware and low-end hardware. When you sell high-end hardware in ink, typically, those purchasers buy enough ink to offset the revenue loss, the operating loss, if you will, every time we sell a hardware unit. At the low end, oftentimes, you put our hardware unit into the marketplace at a loss, and the customer never buys enough ink to overcome that hardware loss. So we've been very disciplined about where we're gaining share, and we gained share in the high-end hardware units and inks that we wanted to. Now by the way, we're also looking at is there a low-end ink hardware unit that we can develop, that we can make more money on than we do today. So we're working on that, but we feel really good about our strategy. I'll also say we expect our multifunction lineup of printers, 16 new printers, to really kick in, in the second half of 2013. We've gotten great market response to that, and we're feeling really good about that. And you saw we gained share in multifunction printers. We expect that to continue. And then the last thing is, as Cathie mentioned in her remarks, Indigo had a record quarter, and this is taking advantage of the move from analog to digital, which I know that the printing group has talked about for many years at HP. I actually think we're seeing some of that, particularly in the Indigo space.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: Just a clarification and question. On the cost savings, maybe to ask a question a different way, can you just maybe answer, of the $3 billion to $3.5 billion of savings that you were targeting to the end of '14, how many -- how much of that benefited HP in the last fiscal year? And then for Cathie, given the strong free cash flow, $7.5 billion last year and $3.5 billion in the quarter, are you still guiding for $5 billion of free cash flow only in fiscal year '13?
Catherine Lesjak: So let me start with the cash flow question. So we're not updating our guidance or our outlook for cash flow in -- for fiscal '13, but I think what is important to kind of take away from the results that we had in Q4 is that when we focus, we achieve results. And we are focused on driving free cash flow for this company, and that means making our earnings, generating cash earnings out of that, focusing on our working capital and driving our cash conversion cycle and finally, really focusing on CapEx and making sure that every dollar of CapEx is returning, is appropriate cost of capital or better. And so that is a renewed focus, I would say, in fiscal '13.
Margaret Whitman: With regard to the cost savings, listen, the cost savings focus in 2 areas: labor, which we've talked about and that's the benefits of the restructuring charge; and then non-labor, and Cathie give you some additional color on the non-labor. And these savings, as Cathie mentioned, are nonlinear, particularly in the labor side as we've said. As you know, making changes to your labor force in Western Europe is a real challenge and sometimes takes as long as 12 to 18 months to actually execute that change, but that's what we are doing. So we achieved the savings we thought we would in 2012, and we are on track for 2013. But I will say that labor savings in Western Europe is a real challenge, but we're committed to it.
Operator: And that question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I just wanted to return to Autonomy. Could you provide some details on the steps and timing of your pursuit of remedies from Autonomy and other parties? Just sort of what should we expect? What have your lawyers told you? And how is this process sort of going to work itself through?
Margaret Whitman: Well, as I mentioned, we have turned the investigation over. Our internal investigation is ongoing, and we've got more work to do there, but we have turned over the investigation to the SEC enforcement division in the United States and the security -- the Serious Fraud Office in the U.K. And that will -- that process is underway. It will take some time. Listen, I think we all know that the legal system in both countries, this will take a long time to work through, but we are committed to seeking redress for the benefit of our shareholders. And it will take some time, Shannon. I mean, I suspect this is a multi-year journey through the courts in both countries.
Shannon Cross: And just so to be clear, you wait to get whatever they do and then you pursue civil charges?
Margaret Whitman: Basically, yes. I mean, as I understand this, and I'm relatively new to this, is that the SEC and the securities -- the Serious Fraud Office will make a determination as to whether to pursue this case, and then they will come and look at what we have and what the other parties say and we'll carry that on. Great. Well, thank you very much for listening this morning. Thank you for coming on in the beginning of the day as opposed to the end of the day, and we look forward to talking with you all more. Thank you very much.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you.

===== 2012 Q3  (2012-08-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Welcome to the Third Quarter 2012 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Monica, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rob Binns, Vice President of Investor Relations. Rob, you may begin.
Rob Binns: Good afternoon. Welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer.  And Cathie Lesjak, HP's Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, may I remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If the risks or uncertainties ever materialize or the assumptions prove incorrect, the results of HP may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements and assumptions. All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, any projections of revenue, margins, expenses, earnings, earnings per share, tax provisions, cash flows, share repurchases, currency exchange rates, the impact of acquisitions or other financial items; any projections of the amount, timing or impact of cost savings, restructuring charges, early retirement programs, workforce reductions or impairment charges; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; and any statements concerning the expected development, performance, market share or competitive performance relating to products or services; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. A discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions is set forth in more detail in HP's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-Q. HP assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including any tax-related items, reflect estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's third quarter Form 10-Q. Revenue, earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including, amongst other things, amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. Now I'll turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Since our last earnings call, we've made progress on HP's turnaround. We are focusing the company on our strategic priorities and driving organizational change. These actions will make HP more efficient, easier to do business with and easier to work for. We have great opportunities in front of us, but we also have a number of challenges. Some of them are macroeconomic, others are industry trends and, frankly, some are about HP's execution. Make no mistake about it, we're still in the early stages of a turnaround. There will be challenges ahead that could create some variability in performance. But I'm confident in our ability to work through them and get to where we want to be. With that as a backdrop, let's take a look at the third quarter. Overall, we had a decent quarter. And again, we did what we said we are going to do. While revenue declined 5%, or 2% in constant currency, the trajectory of the decline flattened in Q3. This is encouraging in light of the deteriorating macroeconomic environment. At the same time, we exceeded the non-GAAP diluted EPS outlook of $0.94 to $0.97 that we gave in May. We delivered $1, beating the high end of our outlook by $0.03 a share on revenues of $29.7 billion. When you look at our performance during the quarter, there were things that we did well, and there were things that we could have done better. Looking at the positives for the quarter, Storage, Networking, IPG and hyperscale servers delivered solid results. Our 3PAR business grew more than 60% in the third quarter, and we announced new enhancements to our HP StoreOnce product that delivered record-breaking backup performance. This technology was developed in HP Labs and includes more than 50 patent-pending innovations. In HP Networking, we delivered strong results, with revenue growth up 10% over the prior year, normalized for divestiture. Our Virtual Application Network technology is enabling administrators to automate changes in their networks and deploy an application in minutes instead of the weeks it currently takes. In Industry Standard Servers, we made progress in aligning our supply chain and engineering capabilities in hyperscale. This is building our competitive advantage to win and win profitably in this fast-growing market. On a less positive note, the mainstream server market continues to show weakness. However, we believe the progress we're making in hyperscale will inform our capabilities to further improve in the mainstream server business over the long term. In IPG, we saw solid margin improvement in the third quarter. Ink Advantage, our innovative business model targeting affordable printing in emerging markets, made significant progress. We greatly expanded the number of countries we now cover with this program. Our focus on the high end of the hardware market continues to show positive results with strong share gains. We also launched HP ePrint Enterprise 2.0. This amazing technology enables enterprises to easily connect every employee's mobile device to an existing fleet of network printers via HP's cloud printing solution. In the area of cloud and information, we introduced a number of innovations, including an enhanced version of our flagship product, HP CloudSystem. CloudSystem enables enterprises and service providers to create private, managed and public cloud environments. We now have almost 750 unique CloudSystem customers. We also announced HP Converged Cloud services for airlines, a hybrid delivery approach to the cloud specifically designed to help airlines create new revenue streams, deliver better service to their customers, lower their costs and increase productivity. And we released our first public cloud services, backed by an industry-leading Service Level Agreement. Built on proven HP technologies, HP Cloud Services also leverages OpenStack, providing a foundation for one of the most open and scalable set of cloud services in the market. And we continue to leverage the IP of our acquisitions across the portfolio. We announced a number of integrated solutions that combine the power of Autonomy, Vertica, Enterprise Services and our Converged Infrastructure to address the problems and opportunities of Big Data. Now let me talk about our customers. And in Q3, we had some great customer wins. For example, Russian Railways, the world's second-largest railway, engaged HP Software to improve the efficiency of their IT operations using HP's broad portfolio of IT management software. The U.S. Air Force selected HP to provide PCs and workstations around the world. NASCAR announced the development of the NASCAR Fan and Media Engagement Center, a resource that will leverage HP's Information Management, analytics and social media offerings to enable NASCAR to engage with consumers through leading media channels. And Consolidated Graphics, one of the world's largest and most extensive commercial print service providers, purchased 10 HP Indigo 10000 digital presses. These customer engagements give you a sense of the breadth and scale of the difference HP makes in the world every day. Now let me outline some areas where we're not where we need to be. While Enterprise Services' performance in the third quarter was within our expectations, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done. Earlier this month, we announced a change in leadership at ES, with Mike Nefkens stepping in to lead on an acting basis. Mike is an experienced leader who has led IT transformations for a number of our largest accounts. In addition, JJ Charhon has taken on a newly defined role as Chief Operating Officer for ES, focusing on increasing customer satisfaction and improving service delivery efficiency. ES is in a multiyear turnaround. And as I have said before, progress will not be linear. We expect to see some variability in performance as we transition and build a more profitable business. We will turn ES around, but it's going to take some time as we focus on margins with both our new business and contract renewals. Moving to PPS, the PC market remains weak, and channel inventory is high across the industry ahead of new product releases. Our PC revenue was down 10% year-over-year, driven by this weakness and an aggressive pricing from our competitors. The reality is we're locked in serious, competitive battles, but we're determined to win. We will fight to sustain our leadership position, particularly in the Commercial space, while remaining focused on profitable growth. To this end, we are executing targeted marketing and promotional programs to support the business in Q4. Autonomy still requires a great deal of attention, and we've been aggressively working on that business. Among the many changes we've instituted is a global dashboard to track Autonomy's pipeline, a single global sales methodology, a single HP services engagement process and a global process to measure client satisfaction and service delivery progress. These actions are designed to help deliver predictable results and improve after-sale customer satisfaction. We crossed an important customer milestone with Autonomy LiveVault, our cloud-based data protection service for content archiving, passing the 10,000-customer mark during the quarter, demonstrating great momentum for this HP cloud service. Overall, we have a very long way to go, but we are taking steps to fix the problems and help Autonomy succeed. In Q3, we achieved significant progress in reorganizing and restructuring the company. We made several executive moves to help strengthen HP's leadership bench and support our turnaround. Bill Veghte was named Chief Operating Officer, with responsibility to further accelerate the execution of the company's strategy. Bill is working closely with his peers to support key projects with the ultimate goal of making the collective HP more than just the sum of its parts. And we welcome George Kadifa as our new head of HP Software. George joined us from Silver Lake partners and is well known for his expertise in building and managing technology businesses and software development. The integration of PSG and IPG is well under way. We are reducing overlap and driving cost reductions between the 2 businesses while at the same time taking advantage of their combined scale. We've streamlined the Enterprise group sales management. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking aggressive steps to right the ship at Enterprise Services. Moving on to other parts of our restructuring, we achieved our targets in Q3 with approximately 4,000 employees leaving the company. Given the timing of the action, we saw minimal savings due to these efforts inside the quarter. However, greater-than-expected acceptance of the early retirement program has accelerated the workforce reduction program, and we now expect approximately 11,500 employees to leave the company in fiscal year '12 versus our prior estimate of 9,000. That sums up where we ended Q3. Now let me spend a couple of moments talking about Q4 and our future outlook. There are a number of headwinds we face that fall into 3 areas: macroeconomic and industry trends as well as challenges in HP's execution. I've talked before about the tectonic plate shifts in the industry that are occurring:  cloud, mobility, virtualization and more.  All are impacting the way customers, both enterprise and consumer, are leveraging technology. This means HP needs to shift its portfolio. This will require some trade-offs and some time. We expect the underlying macro and industry headwinds, which have recently intensified, will remain in Q4 and well into FY '13. This will pressure both our top line performance and our ability to reposition our portfolio and make the right investments. HP has some great assets to build on, but the near-term outlook will be challenging as we set this company up for the long term. While there is little we can do about the macroeconomic and industry trends, execution is another matter. HP has to do a better job of executing against its goals. To that end, we've made a number of organizational changes that may be a distraction in the short term but are absolutely the right thing to do in the long term. Therefore, we expect fiscal year '12 non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.05 to $4.07, consistent with the low end of our previous outlook for the fiscal year. So in summary, we're focused on driving innovation across our business. I'm very excited about the new products and services we will launch this fall, including a new line of PCs and tablets with a focus on design, a line of multifunction printers and new additions to our security portfolio, both in Software and Enterprise Services. We're also rebuilding our balance sheet. We generated $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $2.1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter and reduced our net debt position by over $1.5 billion in the quarter. In short, we still have a lot of work ahead us, but with the support of customers, employees and investors, I'm confident in our ability to reinvigorate HP. With that, I'd like to turn over to Cathie to provide more detail on the quarter.
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you, Meg. I'll review the third quarter performance and then close with our fourth quarter outlook. In the third quarter, revenue was $29.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Our geographic performance reflects the continued macroeconomic challenges across the globe. In the Americas, revenue was $13.4 billion, down 5% year-over-year as reported and down 3% in constant currency. Revenue in EMEA was down 4% to $10.6 billion, and revenue in Asia Pacific was down 7% year-over-year to $5.7 billion. On a constant currency basis, EMEA was up 1% as growth in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe was somewhat offset by declines in Western Europe. APJ was down 6% in constant currency, largely driven by continued weakness in China. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.4% was flat year-over-year as improvements in IPG and Software margins were offset by declines in PSG and Services. The 20-basis-point sequential improvement in gross margins was driven by the improvement in IPG. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, down $22 million year-over-year and down 4% sequentially due to lower marketing and field selling costs. As we discussed previously, there was little impact of the restructuring cost savings in Q3 as most of the employee departures were late in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 9.2%, down 60 basis points year-over-year, and the company delivered $2.7 billion in operating profit. The bridge from non-GAAP operating profit to non-GAAP earnings per share includes the following: other income and expense yielded a net expense of $224 million; our tax rate was approximately 22%; and we used $365 million in the quarter to repurchase 16.5 million shares, bringing our weighted average share count to 1,975,000,000 shares, which is down 5% year-over-year. As a result, we exceeded our non-GAAP guidance in the quarter, delivering non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1 and a GAAP loss per share of $4.49. Third quarter fiscal 2012 GAAP loss per share includes after-tax costs of approximately $5.49 per share related primarily to the impairment of goodwill, amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. We have a detailed bridge in the earnings deck posted on the HP Investor Relations website. Now turning to our business segments. Personal Systems Group delivered revenue of $8.6 billion in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, with a 4.7% operating margin. Total units shipped were down 10% year-over-year as we saw weakness in overall consumer demand as well as geographic softness across Asia Pacific and the Americas. By category, commercial revenue was down 9% and consumer revenue declined 12% year-over-year. Turning to Imaging and Printing. Net revenue for IPG was $6 billion, down 3% year-over-year, with supplies revenue declining 3%. As Meg mentioned, we have made hardware share gains in the high end and are pleased to see the traction with moving ink products into the commercial segment. At the same time, the demand environment, particularly for consumers, remains a headwind, affecting our success in balancing sell-in and sell-through activity with the channel. We need to reduce channel inventory through close inspection and end user demand stimulation. Operating profit was up 1.6 points year-over-year to 15.8% of revenue and $949 million in profits. Supplies were 67% of the mix, and we saw margin rate improvements across hardware and toner, which contributed to the margin improvement. By business unit, total printer unit shipment volume was down 17% year-over-year, largely driven by the decline in consumer as we focused on the higher-end units. Consumer printer revenue was down 13% year-over-year with hardware units down 23%. Commercial printer revenue and hardware units were up 4% year-over-year. Moving on to Services. As we announced on August 8, we are recording a GAAP-only noncash pretax charge of approximately $8 billion for the impairment of goodwill within the Services segment. The impairment stems from the recent trading values of HP stock coupled with market conditions and business trends within the Services segment. We do not expect this goodwill impairment charge to result in any future cash expenditures or otherwise affect the ongoing business or financial performance of the Services segment. In the third quarter, Services delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, down 3% from the prior year and up 1% in constant currency. Operating profit of $959 million was 11% of revenue, down 2.7 points from the prior year but still within our expected range of 10% to 12%. The year-over-year decline was due to the unfavorable impact of resource management and account performance and runoff, somewhat offset by an improvement in the cost of services delivery. We saw strong sequential growth in the total contract signings for our Strategic Enterprise Services, which includes cloud, application modernization, security and information management and analytics. The revenue pipeline is promising, although it is not yet significant enough to outweigh the revenue declines created by the runoff of lower margins in that strategic business. IT Outsourcing revenue at $3.7 billion was down 6% year-over-year as we continued to scrutinize new deals and renewals for margin and strategic fit. Application and business services revenue was flat year-over-year at $2.5 billion and up 5% in constant currency. Technology Services revenue was down 1% year-over-year to $2.6 billion and flat sequentially. Turning to Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking. Revenue of $5.1 billion was down 4% year-over-year, impacted by declines in BCS and softness in the EMEA market. Operating profit was $562 million, and the operating margin of 10.9% was 2 points lower than the prior-year period. The margin decrease was driven by competitive pricing and a higher mix of less profitable customers in regions within Industry Standard Servers and a lower mix of BCS, somewhat offset by growth in networking. Now let's dive into the ESSN performance by business. In Storage, the continued strong performance of 3PAR, with more than 60% growth, and StoreOnce, with double-digit growth, did not offset the decline in EVA and Tape revenue. External disk revenue was flat year-over-year, and total Storage revenue was down 5% year-over-year. Overall, Business Critical Systems revenue declined 16% year-over-year. Within BCS, NonStop server revenue grew double-digits, but BCS performance continued to be impacted by Itanium revenue decline, even with the first ruling in the Oracle Itanium case going in our favor. Industry Standard Server revenue declined 3% year-over-year with broad-based geographic weakness across the industry and competitive pricing. The order ramp for the Gen8 ProLiant server is still outpacing that of Gen7. Networking revenue was up 6% year-over-year at $647 million or up 10% when normalized for divestitures in Q1. We have made significant improvements in sales execution, successfully signing 46 new logos in the quarter, which has been up every quarter this year. Software revenue of $973 million was up 18% from the prior-year quarter. Macro challenges in EMEA and the Americas as well as sales execution issues negatively impacted Software license revenue, which grew 2%. This was offset by growth in our support and services revenue of 16% and 65%, respectively. As Meg discussed, we have a lot of work to do over the next several quarters to improve Autonomy performance, and we will be focused on improving pipeline conversions and execution across the entire Software business. SaaS revenue, a strategic aspect of the portfolio, is growing well. Overall, third quarter operating profit for Software was $175 million or 18% of revenue. HP Financial Services revenue was flat year-over-year at $935 million. Financing volume was down 2%, and net portfolio assets increased 2% year-over-year. Operating profit of $97 million was up 10% year-over-year to 10.4% of revenue. Now on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. As we have said, we remain committed to rebuilding our balance sheet. Operating cash flow was up quarter-on-quarter to $2.8 billion, and free cash flow was $2.1 billion. Total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion. During the quarter, we returned $365 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $9.3 billion remaining in the authorized share repurchase program. We also increased the dividend by 10% and paid $260 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. We have been working to improve our cash conversion cycle and brought it down by 1 day sequentially this quarter. But at 27 days, it is still up 1 day from the prior year. We have more work to do in Q4 and fiscal '13 on accelerating our cash conversion cycle. And our focus here: to get back to historical levels. Now turning to our outlook, which was impacted by HP execution issues, market dynamics and macro assumptions. For HP as a company, we are in the early stages of our turnaround and of our restructuring efforts. In fact, some of the changes we are making to improve our business long term, such as realigning and restructuring our sales force, are impacting our revenue performance in the short term. In Services, our diligence around account profitability is putting pressure on our signings of both new logos and renewals, which accelerates the need to manage costs aggressively. The organizational and operational improvements we are making to our cost structure will have a positive impact in the fourth quarter, but those benefits will be needed to counteract some of the headwinds we are facing. In terms of the market conditions, consumer demand remains soft in PCs and printing, resulting in elevated levels of channel inventory for us in PSG consumer and IPG. We will look to manage sell-ins consistent with the underlying soft demand. Additionally, the pricing environment in our hardware business remains competitive. From a macro perspective, the environment is even more challenging than we previously thought even 2 months ago. We are cautious about the growth prospects globally for both consumer and commercial spending. And we expect that currency will be a headwind to revenue of approximately 3 points year-over-year in Q4. With that context, we expect fiscal year 2012 non-GAAP EPS to be between $4.05 and $4.07, at the low end of our previous outlook for the fiscal year. From the GAAP perspective, we expect our full year GAAP loss per share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.25. We typically conduct an annual review of the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The factors considered in such a review include market conditions, the trading value of HP stock and the long-term outlook for the business. Any one of these factors or any combination thereof may require us to record in Q4 an additional impairment charge against the carrying value of the goodwill in the HP portfolio. Our largest balance for goodwill is in the Software segment. Additionally, as is typical in these cases, there could be a true-up to the goodwill and related tax impact of the impairment charge we recorded in Q3 as we finalize the impairment. We expect to provide an outlook for fiscal 2013 at our Security Analyst Meeting on October 3. Now I'll turn it back over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Cathie. And operator, why don't we go right to question and answer?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
Benjamin Reitzes: I wanted to ask about printing. And you mentioned the channel inventory was really high. Obviously, it would seem that you over-earned in the segment in the quarter. The Street consensus was looking for about 13.7 in terms of operating margin, and so maybe it over-earned by $0.05, if the consensus would have been right, without the extra inventory and sales of those supplies. I was wondering if that analysis makes any sense and what the earnings hit will be in the future when you do finally pull back that inventory? And how should we look at it?
Margaret Whitman: So Ben, let me talk first a little bit more broadly about our margins in IPG. So while we continue to face headwinds of lower volumes and the impact from the Japanese yen on our cost structure, the year-over-year increase in margins was really driven by 3 things. The first is that in Q3 '11, we were dealing with the tragic impact of the tsunami. And as a result of trying to get parts and products out the door, we incurred significant additional costs that we talked about at the time. Obviously, that didn't happen in Q3 '12. We also had improved hardware margins generally due to the higher mix of higher-value units and also a lower mix of inkjet hardware. So those are what contributed to the year-over-year. From a sequential perspective, what you saw was again a higher mix of higher-value units as well as higher margins in toner -- on toner. When you think about kind of going forward and thinking about margins, you have to take into consideration the challenging demand environment that we expect will continue as well as competitive pricing. The yen will remain quite strong on a year-over-year basis. And then in Q3, kind of to your point, we did end with higher channel inventories than the underlying demand would suggest, and that was especially true for ink supplies. What we need to do in that space is continue to focus on channel inventory. The sellout in the last couple of weeks of July fell off a bit more than what we had expected, and we ended up with more than we intended. In terms of the actual math and the fence that you came up with, my math would suggest a lower delta as a result of the channel inventory.
Operator: Our next question comes from Bill Shope of Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Given the comments you made about being aggressive in PCs, the channel inventory issues you have there now and some of the promotional programs you talked about in the coming quarter, how should we think about the near-term trajectory for operating margins and ASPs in PSG? Obviously, we saw some pressure this quarter on the operating margin line, but my sense is that your commentary's telling us that things could get a lot worse in that respect.
Margaret Whitman: Again, maybe perspective on what drove the margins this quarter will help inform kind of how you think about it going forward. The operating margins for PSG this quarter was 4.7%. So while it was down year-on-year, it is still very much in the range that we've been targeting for some time. The bridge from -- on a year-over-year basis includes items like the volume, currency. And to some extent, obviously, commodity prices were also unfavorable. Now this was partially offset by favorable warranty and logistics costs. When we look out at commodity prices into Q4, we would say that LCDs and DRAM prices are going to be up slightly quarter-on-quarter, so there will be additional prices from a quarter-on-quarter perspective. We do expect the demand environment to remain challenging and the pricing to remain competitive. Let me just give you a little perspective on our strategy for our PC business, because I think that can help shape your thinking about where margins will go. So first is we are focused on profitable growth and continuing to deliver a very strong return on invested capital in this business. But we are under attack by very strong competitive pressures, and we're going to respond. And what we're -- how we're responding is really 3 parts. One is product lineup. I think we have among the best product lineup we've had in the PC business for a long time: a host of thin and light Ultrabooks, a Windows 8 tablet for the enterprise. Two, sort of tablet, if you will, tablet combined with laptops for the consumer space. And we've also done a lot of work on our cost structure. One of the benefits of putting IPG and PSG together is we have a much more seamless go-to-market. We have -- we see very good opportunities for freight, logistics, supply chain. And we have got to make sure that our cost structure allows us to compete effectively, because we're going to defend our #1 position in this business.
Operator: Toni Sacconaghi at Sanford Bernstein is online with a question.
Toni Sacconaghi: I wanted to follow up on the comments that you made about channel inventories in both PC and printing. So perhaps you can tell us where absolute levels of channel inventory are for hardware and supplies on the printing side and how that changed sequentially. And similarly, on the IPG side, where are -- excuse me, on the PC side, where is inventory? And given the launch of Windows 8 at the very end of your fiscal Q4, how should we be thinking about inventory changes in both PCs and IPG, quite frankly, over the next 1 to 2 quarters?
Margaret Whitman: Thanks, Toni. Let me start. In terms of channel inventory for IPG, on an absolute dollar basis, they're down. What we have -- the impact that we have is really a denominator effect, and that's why I talked a little bit about the fact that sell-throughs softened in the second half of July, because that is what ended up driving weeks of supply higher than our acceptable ranges, but the dollars were down on an absolute basis. And really, where we saw weak demand was predominantly in Europe and Asia, and that impacted the sell-through in Q3 and, obviously, hampered our efforts to reduce the channel inventory. The channel inventory is more problematic in the supplies area and not in the hardware area for IPG. For PSG, the channel inventory challenges -- overall, the channel inventory is within our acceptable ranges. But where we saw a pop-up was in the consumer space. And so we've got some work to do on that end.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. And if I could just follow up. If your IPG absolute inventory is down, seasonally, IPG is always up in Q4. So that would suggest on a look-forward basis, unless you were expecting a dramatic decline in IPG revenues, you actually should be in better shape. So perhaps you can help us understand how supplies inventory, particularly on the consumer side, changed sequentially in terms of number of weeks. Because from the information you've given us, it actually sounds like your weeks of forward-looking inventory should be better, unless you're expecting something cataclysmic on the demand side. And similarly, on the PSG side, maybe you can help us understand where, in number of weeks, consumer inventory went.
Margaret Whitman: So Toni, we are not expecting anything cataclysmic on the demand side in Q4, and we will continue to work on bringing down our channel inventory levels for supplies in the fourth quarter as well as we're focused on bringing down the consumer channel inventory in PSG.
Operator: Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley is on line with a question.
Kathryn Huberty: Similar to your comments in the week -- last few weeks of July in IPG business, can you comment on linearity in the other businesses? And do you at all prescribe to the Cisco commentary that there were some signs of stabilization or improvement in the month of July in the Enterprise business?
Margaret Whitman: Except for the comments that I've made with respect to the sellout in the second half of July, we don't have a significant linearity difference. What we would probably say is that the entire quarter was fairly weak.
Operator: Okay, Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal on line with a question.
Keith Bachman: Yes, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you think the revenue trends would be in the division. You've talked about IPG and the PC division. But if you could just talk a little bit more about HP in total relative to normal seasonality in October and specifically with the enterprise systems and Software division as well in that overall context, please?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think when you think about -- I'll talk broadly about the Q4 guidance, if you don't mind. Several key considerations that drive the Q4 guidance are really related to revenue. And in fact, at some level for me, it begins and ends with revenue.
Keith Bachman: Yes, sorry, Cathie. I was referring to revenue.
Catherine Lesjak: Yes, I know. The macro was softer than what we had expected in Q3, and we don't expect that to get better in Q4. So that's going to drive year-over-year revenue declines in Q4. We also felt -- expect to see well-below-normal seasonality when you go from Q3 to Q4 in revenue. And that's driven by macro, it's driven by a very competitive pricing environment, but it's also due to HP-specific issues, which range from the Oracle Itanium situation, our challenge in getting our software license growth where it needs to be as well as choices that we're making when you think about focusing on services that have better margins and are more strategic for us. And then also, one of the things that Meg mentioned which I think is important is that the realignment of our sales force, while in the short term is creating some revenue challenges, has a great long-term payback. So that's kind of part of what's going on with revenues that we just talked about, the fact that channel inventory is also a bit of a headwind from Q3 to Q4 as well, because it's out of sync with the underlying demand. So the way I think about it, the reason why I think revenue is the beginning and the end, because we are maniacally focused on cost reduction, and we are going to get the benefits from the restructuring charge that we've announced, and we're well on our way. The top line headwinds are limiting our ability to expand operating margins.
Keith Bachman: Cathie, is there any quantification you could provide to the sequential revenue trends on a consolidated basis? Will, in fact, it be up sequentially from the July numbers? Or any kind of quantification?
Catherine Lesjak: So the normal seasonality is that it would grow from Q3 to Q4, and we expect it will grow. It's just going to grow well behind normal seasonal trends.
Operator: Aaron Rakers of Stifel, Nicolaus is online with a question.
Aaron Rakers: Questions on the Services -- or server side of the business, particularly in the x86 servers side. You talked about broad-based weakness there. You also kind of hinted at a faster Gen8 cycle. Maybe you could give us some insight into what you're seeing competitively and also from a demand perspective. And any color on where we stand with regard to the Gen8 product cycle? I believe your closest competitors talked about 50% of their business now being on the latest platforms.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me take that. It's Meg. So our Industry Standard Servers business, I'd tell you where we have made the most progress is actually in hyperscale. And we are improving that business, and we have some real business model innovation that's absolutely required to compete in that business. We're working on our cost structure. We've got modular shared architecture. And I think we're getting a lot better at this business. And I think we can win in this business and win profitably. Right now, that is dilutive. The hyperscale business is dilutive to our overall ISS margins, and we need to move that up a bit over time. It will always be a slightly lower margin, but we can do better. I will say we are seeing still some weakness in mainstream ISS, and we've got an action plan in place around our sales efforts, around our R&D efforts to make sure that we don't continue to lose ground in that business. It's a very important business for HP and deeply focused on sort of changing the trajectory of that business.
Aaron Rakers: And can I follow up? How much is hyperscale of that business today? Is it fairly small? Or any color there would be helpful.
Margaret Whitman: It's -- well, I don't know what your definition of small is, but I would say it's relatively small but growing rapidly. And it's where all the growth in the market is. The mainstream server business is probably declining in low single-digits. The blade business is still growing reasonably well. But real growth in the business is in hyperscale.  And we're making a concerted effort there with, I think, quite good results thus far.
Operator: We have Brian Alexander of Raymond James on line with a question.
Brian Alexander: Cathie, should we think about the $8 billion goodwill write-down in Services as a reflection of past deterioration in profitability? Or is that perhaps a precursor of future profit erosion? I wasn't clear based on your comments. And if you can update us on the 10% to 12% margin target in Services and if that's still applicable going forward.
Catherine Lesjak: Okay. So let's start with the 10% to 12% margins. That is what we are reconfirming for fiscal '12. And then in terms of the impairment of the Services segment, you really have to look at the fact that there's a number of different factors that drive that.  Things like the trading value of HP stock plays a role as well as the market conditions and the business trends within the Services segment. Our view is that the goodwill impairment charge doesn't result in any -- I'm sorry, can't talk -- future cash expenditures or otherwise affect the ongoing business or financial performance of the Services segment.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me add a point of view on Enterprise Services. I think I've said from the very beginning of my tenure at HP that this was a business that was in need of a turnaround. And after watching and working closely with the group over the first 9 months, I decided that we were not making progress fast enough in terms of the turnaround and so decided to make a leadership change. But here's the things that we need to do to fundamentally get this business on a better track. First is, we've got to change the accountability model. Somewhere along the line, the account basis of accountability with the account leader got diffused across the organization. And in the end, the person who leads these accounts needs to be in charge, have control of revenue and control of the costs. We then need to shift the business mix from some of the low-end services that, frankly, EDS was founded on to where we want to be, which is profitable ITO, the Strategic Enterprise Services, in cloud, in security, in information optimization. And over time, that will shift the margins in the way -- in a place that we want to be and will, frankly, add a lot more value to our customers, which will in turn allow us to sell in more hardware and other products into those very important top 200 accounts that account for a big chunk of that revenue. So we're on a journey here. I feel more confident today about the paths forward in that business than I have any time in the last 12 months. But make no mistake about it, we've got a little ways to go here.
Brian Alexander: And just a quick follow-up on the accelerated headcount for Q4, Cathie. I come up with about a $0.03 benefit to EPS. I just wanted to confirm that.
Catherine Lesjak: So we haven't quantified that benefit. I think the best way to think about it is, obviously, it's included in our guidance and that some of the benefit that we're getting from the restructuring activities is, in fact, going to counteract the top line headwinds we're seeing.
Operator: Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan is online with a question.
Mark Moskowitz: Meg, I want to get a sense here as we all talk about or think about growth and some of the challenges, both macro and structural and company-specific, as we think about rolling forward to 2013, with the pace of reinvestment in terms of taking HP where you want it to be, would that require EPS to actually maybe decline year-over-year in 2013 because of these reinvestments?
Margaret Whitman: So we will give our fiscal year '13 guidance at our Security Analyst Meeting in the first part of October. And so we'll be quite precise at that point. Let me just sort of elevate all the way back up here and just try to give you some perspective on the situation that I see at HP now, having been here nearly a year. So first is, we are facing some macroeconomic trends, Western Europe, the United States, China and the consumer broadly. From an industry perspective, we've got changes where tablets is a growing part of the consumer device business; we've got some challenges around  consumer printing; and we've got pricing pressure across the board, which means we need to adjust our cost structure to be able to compete. Sometimes, folks say to me, "Well, I'm sure the competitor's losing money." Well, actually, they aren't. And we need to make sure that we have a cost structure that allows us to be successful in all parts of the world in all of our businesses. And then we've got some execution challenges. And HP had some very serious challenges and headwinds when I first got here. And we've made progress on many things, but there are still some very serious execution issues in this business, and whether that is improving sales and delivery in ES, whether that is getting the pipeline conversion to where it needs to be in Software, whether that is our ability to compete successfully in hyperscale, whether that is fixing the weak supplies, demand in IPG. I will say a minute about IPG I think we set up a very crisp strategy after I'd been here about 3 or 4 months. And by the way, I think that's part of the reason you're seeing some improvement in that business. But as the category leader, we are the acknowledged category leader here, and we've  got some weakened competitors and we need to go after them. And we also need -- as the category leader, we need to grow the relevance of printing, which you've seen us begin to do in some of the advertising that we've done and explain the difference between our ink and reman ink and our toner and reman toner. And then lastly, sales, in my view, is not where it should be. I think we've done the right things in reorganizing sales management. I'm excited about that. But we've got to improve our aggressiveness. We've got improve our go-to-market. And we've just got to get a lot more aggressive and with a much more, shall I say, focused accountability model that we enforce on a day-to-day basis. So when we look at 2013, we're going to tumble all of the pluses and the minuses. We're going to put in the investments that we think are required, and yet we have to have a cost structure that allows us to win in the marketplace. So we'll have a crisp view of that by 2013. Let me say there's puts and takes.
Operator: Maynard Um from Wells Fargo is online with a question.
Maynard Um: Meg, you talk about the tectonic plate shifts that are happening in the industry. But at the same time, you're obviously navigating some challenging HP-specific issues. Can you just talk about whether you think you can really focus on the longer term while you're still -- while you still have a lot of work to do over the near term? And then relative to your competitors, feel like they're any further along than HP at this point?
Margaret Whitman: So that's what we have to do, is we have to focus on the short term, and we have to focus on the long term. Because if we don't focus on the long term, we will constantly be behind, but if we don't fix our short-term operations, we won't have the money to invest in the long term. So we have to do both, and it's a balancing act. I will say one of the things we are doing is we are looking through all the different things that we do at HP, and the portfolio is vast. I don't know if you had the chance to come to HP DISCOVER and see everything that HP did, but we are looking through all our different portfolios and saying, "Do we need to be doing this R&D? Do we need to be focused on this many products in this many segments of the market across 166 countries?" Because my deeply held belief is focus, focus, focus is going to be an important thing for us, so we are committed to the major businesses that we are in 100%. But behind the curtain, there's lots of smaller initiatives that I think we can take those resources and get more bang for the buck by really investing behind some of our best growth opportunities. So that's part of the way we're going to solve our near-term problems and, at the same time, free up the capacity to invest in the long term, along with, of course, our restructuring program. So it's complicated, there's no question about it. But I feel like we're much farther along on that journey than we were, say, 9 or 10 months ago.
Maynard Um: If I could just follow up. Does that imply, then, that some of the -- that you -- we could see some smaller divestitures from HP, and not necessarily the large ones that people have talked about in the past but some of the sort of noncore assets?
Margaret Whitman: No, they wouldn't be big divestitures by any stretch of the imagination, but we have lots of little initiatives buried throughout this company. And some of them we may just shut down if they are organic R&D. Some of them, there may be a salable asset there. But these are not big-dollar items. They're just going to let us focus and let us put the resources where we're going to get the best returns.
Catherine Lesjak: And I think the way to think about it is that we're stepping that up, because we have had small divestitures kind of off and on over the last number of years. This is just a much more focused attention. To Meg's point, we need to focus more, not less.
Operator: Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: I have a question for, I guess, Cathie on free cash flow. It looks, Cathie, like this year, HP will probably do maybe $5 billion of free cash flow, which is meaningfully down year-on-year. So can you just remind us what the exceptional, let's say, onetime cash items may have been this year? I'm just thinking if this is the rate of cash flow that HP can generate, for you to repair your balance sheet and really start meaningfully giving cash back to shareholders or accelerate it, it may take 2 more years from where we are now.
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So first off, I think that a high point for this quarter is the cash flow that we generated. We generated $2.8 billion of cash flow, free cash flow $2.1 billion. We were able to improve our net debt position at the company level by more than $1.5 billion this quarter at the same time that we reduced the shares outstanding by roughly 17 million shares and we increased our dividend 10%, so we paid dividends of $260 million. So I do think that we're making progress there. If you look at what the meaningful headwinds were to cash flow for this year compared to last year, earnings has to be #1. We have also had cash conversion cycle. I'll also tell you I think it was a positive point in this quarter around our cash conversion cycle. Last quarter, I told you that we needed to pay attention to it and really focus on it, that we weren't happy with the results. And quarter-on-quarter, we improved a day. We've got more work to do. It'll take us into -- through Q4 and into '13 to get back to historical levels, but we're deeply focused on the cash conversion cycle as well.
Operator: Shannon Cross of Cross Research is on line with a question.
Shannon Cross: Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in China? I mean, we heard pretty negative commentary out of Dell yesterday. Clearly, you had some pressure in the region as well, but not just for PCs but also within printers. And then any other services and products that you provide in the -- into that market? And also from a vertical standpoint, because it sounds like public may be slowing there, I don't know. Just any color you can give would be very helpful.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, sure. Well, let me elevate too the BRIC countries, because, actually, Russia and India were good performers for us. Brazil was sort of medium to mixed, and China was not as strong as we would have liked. And there's challenges across the board there. We are rebuilding from, as you will recall, a whole series of incidents that hurt HP disproportionately to our competitors there. So we are building -- rebuilding, first, our leadership in China. We have almost an entirely new team across the board in China, and I'm very confident in their abilities. I like them very much. They know what's going on. They're experienced hands. Second, we are building -- rebuilding the channel in China for both PCs as well as printers. This is actually one of the benefits of putting these 2 businesses together, because as we build the channel in China, there's a lot more to offer a channel partner. And then we are also rebuilding the channel with ESSN, our Server, Storage and Networking. A bright spot, of course, is our Networking business in China, where we have a very significant market share that did very well during the quarter. But we see economic slowdown in China. The reported growth rates, many people say "Geez, I'm not sure that the reported growth rates are actually what we're seeing on the ground," and I would agree with that. And at the same time, I think we can improve our execution in China. And you've got a regime change that will happen there as well, and I think there's a bit of -- what I've seen in the business community there is, "Let's wait and see what happens there," and, "What is the public sector spending going to look like?" "What is the Chinese stimulus program going to look like?" which will drive public sector sales.
Rob Binns: Okay, great. Thanks for that question, Shannon. And with that, ladies and gentlemen, I think we can conclude the call for today. Thank you very much.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you for participating in the Third Quarter 2012 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.

I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. The second quarter marks my first 6 months at HP, and I continue to learn about the company every day. It's inspiring. You're surrounded by incredible technology, tremendous innovation, and the people are just terrific. For example, since we last spoke, I participated in TechCon, which is HP's annual internal innovation show. Think of it as the world's greatest science fair for adults, and I was just blown away. The excitement, the enthusiasm, the commitment of HP's technical and innovation community is amazing. From nanoscale-sensing technologies to the memristor, to software that can actually learn, we have an array of forward-looking technologies that are revolutionary. Without question, our innovation engine is alive and well. Now we just need to do a better job of aligning that engine with our businesses in developing a better, faster path to market. I also recently attended the Drupa conference, which is a show held every 4 years in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, to showcase the very latest in commercial graphics and printing. And again, I was deeply impressed. It's a chance to see our Color Inkjet Web Press and Indigo portfolio in context. You can see customers and potential customers gravitating towards our innovation. And you clearly can see the shift from analog to digital commercial print happening right before your eyes. The market is being disrupted, and we're leading the charge. I left Drupa with a deeper appreciation for the opportunity HP has to transform that industry. So now let's talk about HP's performance. Overall, I feel cautiously optimistic coming out of Q2. Our results appear to be stabilizing. While I wouldn't say we turned the corner, we are making progress. For starters, we once again did what we said we were going to do. Our guidance for second quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.88 to $0.91, and we delivered $0.98, beating the high end of our outlook by $0.07 a share on revenues of $30.7 billion. While earnings and revenues were both down over the prior-year period, the trajectory of the decline began to flatten in Q2, which is encouraging. Cathie will dig deeper into the numbers and the segment performance in just a few minutes, but let me share a few top-level observations. In PSG, we delivered a solid performance. PSG held margins steady, and an uptick in the commercial business helped offset continued weakness on the consumer side. This contributed to a sequential 6.5% increase in revenue and revenue that was also up slightly year-over-year. With much less impact from the HDD shortage, we executed well and achieved a 2-point sequential gain in worldwide PC market share in calendar Q1. In the process, we reclaimed the #1 share position for commercial globally and we also took the #1 position for commercial in the U.S. from a competitor whoâs held the top rank for more than 1 decade. We're absolutely committed to outstanding product design, engineering and quality, attributes that defined HP for decades. You can see that commitment in the big refresh of the PC and printing portfolio we announced in Shanghai a couple of weeks ago. The launch gave us a boost in China, where I think we're starting to regain some momentum. And speaking with customers and partners, I've heard a lot of excitement about the products we introduced, like the Spectre XT, and our new multifunction Color LaserJet Printer. Consumers love the new products and CIOs trust them in a secure work environment. They strike the perfect balance between beautiful design and the workhorse characteristics that businesses and governments require. In IPG, we improved channel inventory to within an acceptable range. However, we continue to face a weak demand environment, and year-over-year, IPG revenues declined by 10%. Over the last few quarters, IPG has been challenged by external factors such as weak consumer demand and natural disasters, but we're also getting clarity on some of the key actions necessary to continue building on IPG's leadership. We started marketing the quality and innovation of our hardware and supplies, and we're working on new pricing models, services and solutions to further differentiate our offerings. As you know, in Q2, we announced a strategic realignment that included having the PC and printing businesses join forces under the leadership of Todd Bradley. So far, this is going very well and we see tremendous potential for accelerated growth and efficiencies through common branding, improved marketing, better retail positioning, more attractive product bundles and seamless, best-in-class interoperability. Turning to Services. Revenues was essentially flat year-over-year in constant currency and we stabilized margins. While margin may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, we believe that a 10% to 12% range is the right sustainable profit margin profile for Services through the remainder of FY '12. We're focused on building out strategic practice areas in Cloud, security, Information Management and Application Transformation. And we're strengthening the industry alignment of our Services business to help us better solve customer challenges, create more customer value and deepen customer relationships. We're excited about growing these higher-margin categories, but this is a business that continues to be challenged. It's a journey and we have a lot of work ahead of us in this turnaround. In Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking, full year revenue declined 6% over the prior-year period. Within that, our Storage and Networking businesses held steady, logging slight annual growth. Storage was a tale of 2 cities. Our 3PAR solutions continued to gain strong traction in the marketplace, growing more than 100% year-over-year, while revenue in our StoreOnce products almost doubled. At the same time, tape and EVA are declining. This is an anticipated product transition and we're effectively managing the shift to our next-generation storage arrays. In Networking, we have a great value proposition and innovation. In one recent development, we worked with AMD on implementing their cloud data center. HP Networking and Server technologies helped reduce the data center footprint by more than 50%, while increasing network capacity and improving performance. And with new solutions like our recently launched virtual application networks, we plan to continue being the disruptor. In Industry Standard Servers, the HDD shortage was still a factor and we had a tough quarter. However, there's strong promise here. We have some outstanding solutions in the market that we expect to restore the momentum in the category. For example, the launch order ramp for our Gen8 ProLiant server is outpacing that of the Gen7 server. Business Critical Systems, not surprisingly, is still facing challenges from the Oracle Itanium issue, but more important is how we're moving forward. Our Odyssey solution is an innovative, mission-critical x86 platform that will offer customers a transition to open, standards-based architectures. As part of the Q2 strategic alignment, the global account sales organization joined Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking under the leadership of Dave Donatelli. This is also going well. The new model sharpens the focus of our sales teams, moves decision making closer to the deal and provides a simplified customer experience. The outcome is a more responsive HP that will make it easier for us to sell effectively and bring more of our portfolio to more of our accounts. In conversations with customers and partners, it's clear that they understand and appreciate the direction we've taken. In Software, we grew 22% year-over-year, with growth in licenses, support and Services. We had some good wins. For example, in security, we signed a SaaS testing services agreement in Europe that's the biggest deal ever for HP/Fortify. However, we're also facing some challenges. Autonomy had a very disappointing license revenue quarter, with a significant decline year-over-year resulting in a shortfall to our expectations. To help improve Autonomy's performance, Bill Veghte, HP's Chief Strategy Officer and Executive Vice President of HP Software, will step in to lead Autonomy. Mike Lynch, Autonomy's Founder and Executive Vice President for Information Management, will leave HP after a transition period. The market and competitive position for Autonomy remains strong, particularly in Cloud offering, and we have been flooded with a number of big deal leads. Bill is an experienced software leader who will develop the right processes and discipline to scale Autonomy and fulfill its promise, although it will take a few quarters to see tangible improvements. So big picture, I'd say, that our performance began to stabilize. We saw some bright spots. There's still an awful lot of work to be done and we're looking at every option to accelerate the pace. As discussed during our Q1 call, we are working very hard to better align HP's cost structure with its revenue profile. We're streamlining and removing complexity at every turn, and in the process, we're creating the capacity to invest in innovation and quality. And over time, we're, of course, thinking about how we can drop some of our savings to the bottom line. The strategic realignment we announced last quarter was a good first step, and today, we're taking the next step with the announcement of a multiyear restructuring that will touch every part of HP and create a more streamlined business. We expect to take a pretax charge of approximately $1.7 billion to be included in our FY '12 GAAP results, as well as an additional pretax charge of $1.8 billion to be included in our FY '13 and FY '14 GAAP results. As part of the restructuring, we expect to reduce the workforce by 27,000 positions by the end of 2014, which we'll achieve through a combination of layoffs and a voluntary early retirement program. This restructuring is expected to generate run rate cost savings of approximately $3 billion to $3.5 billion exiting fiscal year 2014. Workforce reductions are never easy. They adversely impact people's lives, but in this case, they're absolutely critical for the long-term health of the company. Our goal is simple: a better outcome for the customers at reduced costs for HP. And while optimizing the workforce is one area that we absolutely need to get right, we see a lot of opportunity in a number of additional areas as well. I know that you're well aware of the cost-reduction efforts that were undertaken in years past. There's been some great work on things like data center consolidation, reducing the number of applications and in horizontal functions such as HR, legal and finance. What we're doing now is very different. We're going after the big cost buckets and fundamental business process re-engineering in our core businesses. This includes optimizing the supply chain, reducing the number of SKUs and platforms, continuing to hone our real estate strategies, simplifying our go-to-market, improving business processes and implementing consistent pricing and promotions to drive end-user demand profitably. It's harder work, but we believe that we'll have a significant payoff over the long term. Over time, some of the savings will drop to the bottom line, but the majority will be reinvested using a disciplined, data-driven process to prioritize organic opportunities across the business. Return on investment will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and the investments will be calibrated accordingly. We'll be investing to drive leadership in the 3 strategic pillars of Cloud, security and Information Management. And in each of our businesses, weâll make investments to stay ahead of customer expectations and market trends. In our PC and printing businesses, we'll be focused on design, engineering, quality and generating demand and desire with our customers. In Services, we're improving processes and building out capabilities in Cloud, security and information. We'll also be strengthening our industry practices, as well as our service quality and innovation. In Software, we'll be investing to speed development across security, information and management infrastructure for both on-premise IT and in the Cloud, with a key focus on Software-as-a-Service offering. This will include the extension of Vertica and Autonomy across our entire portfolio. For example, deploying them in our document workflow solutions and in building out our Information Management practice and services. And in ESSN, we'll invest to drive R&D and innovation in our core businesses of Server, Storage and Networking. Together, they create a Converged Infrastructure that is the foundation for top customer initiatives, such as Cloud, Big Data analytics and social media. And we'll also invest in our people, in better training and better career development. There's a lot we have to do and we are moving quickly, but we are not taking our eye off the ball when it comes to executing against our ongoing priorities. I'll share just a few examples. In the last quarter, we continued to improve our sales tools with the first wave rollout of our new CRM system and enhancements to hp.com. And in the PC space, a major Mac reseller has taken on the Z1 Workstation, which offers a combination of accelerated performance and design that's not available in any other product on the market today. We also continued to drive our strategy with the announcement of the HP Converged Cloud, the industry's first hybrid delivery approach and portfolio based on a common architecture, spanning traditional IT, private, managed and public clouds. We announced 10 new products and services to our already extensive Cloud portfolio, and customers are embracing the accelerated innovation, enhanced agility and lower costs that our solutions provide. At HP DISCOVER, we'll be sharing a lot more about our strategy, our portfolio and how we're helping customers succeed. So stay tuned. I covered a lot today, so let me leave you with a few final thoughts. During our second quarter, we did what we said we were going to do. HP showed some positive, early signs of stabilizing performance. We made progress in a number of areas and delivered on our outlook. We remain confident and expect to achieve non-GAAP earnings per share of at least $4 for FY '12, even before any savings from the restructuring. While the restructuring should improve EPS over time, the pace at which we're able to realize savings and reinvest them is likely to vary quarter-to-quarter, so we don't expect the progress to be completely linear. Things like normal seasonality may not play out exactly the way you're used to seeing it, so our guidance is going to be important. But what matters most, I believe, is that HP is now taking aggressive steps to rebuild and strengthen the company for the long term. I am more confident than ever in our path and in our future. By removing complexity, we're making it easier to do business with HP, easier to sell HP products and easier to work at HP. We're building HP into a more efficient and effective organization that can survive the test of time. And we're creating the capacity to invest, to drive innovation against our strategic pillars of Cloud, security and Information Management, to advance each of our businesses and to ultimately deliver better return for our shareholders. Turning HP around is going to be a lot of hard work. It's going to take time, but we know what needs to be done. And with the actions we've announced today, we're fast-advancing the process. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Cathie to provide more details on the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you, Meg. I'll start with a quick review of the quarterly performance and then give some more details about the restructuring efforts, including expectations for cost savings, headcount reductions, reinvestment and GAAP charges. I'll close with our guidance for Q3 and the second half of fiscal '12. For the Q2 results. Revenue was $30.7 billion, down 3% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. PSG revenue was flat year-over-year and gained 2 points a share worldwide, quarter-over-quarter, as the business recovered from the hard disk drive shortage triggered by last year's Thailand flooding. ESSN and IPG revenues declined generally as we expected due to the impact of the hard disk drive shortage on ESSN and IPG's continued focus on reducing excess channel inventory. In terms of our revenue performance by geography, in the Americas, revenue was $13.8 billion, flat year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Revenue in EMEA was down 7% to $10.9 billion and revenue in Asia Pacific was down 1% year-over-year to $6 billion. On a constant-currency basis, EMEA and APJ revenues were down 6% and 3%, respectively, year-over-year. These results reflect the continued macroeconomic challenges in EMEA and some sequential improvement in China. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.2% was down 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins continue to be impacted by the strong yen, a lower mix of supply, continued margin pressure in services and competitive pricing in our hardware businesses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.4 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by acquisitions and our annual salary increases. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.9% was down 240 basis points year-over-year and the company delivered $1.9 billion in operating profit. The bridge from operating profit to earnings per share includes the following. Other income and expense yielded a net expense of $243 million, our tax rate was approximately 22% and we used $350 million in the quarter to repurchase 13 million shares, bringing our weighted average share count to 1,987,000,000 shares, which is down 9% year-over-year. As a result, we exceeded our guidance in the quarter, delivering non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.98 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.80. The majority of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in Q2 was amortization of purchased intangible assets. Now turning to our business segments. As Meg highlighted, the Personal Systems Group had strong sequential growth. It delivered revenue of $9.5 billion in the quarter, flat year-over-year, with a 5.5% operating margin. We saw a recovery in desktops and the commercial segment, but consumer notebook demand remained soft. Total units shipped were down 1% year-over-year, but this decline was offset by an increase in the average selling price. By category, commercial revenue increased 3% and consumer revenue declined 4% year-over-year. Workstation revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Notebook revenue declined 3% year-over-year on a 6% decline in units. And desktop revenue and units were up 5% year-over-year. Moving on to Services. Services delivered revenue of $8.8 billion, down 1% from the prior-year quarter and flat in constant currency. Operating profit of $997 million was 11.3% of revenue, down 4.1 points from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of resource management and investments in sales and service delivery. In the second quarter, IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.7 billion was down 3% year-over-year, as we are being more selective in the deals we pursue. New deals need to be a good strategic fit and have attractive margins. Application and Business Services revenue was up 1% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, reflecting the progress we're making in the strategic Enterprise services, including Cloud, Application Modernization and Information Management and analytics. Technology Services revenue was flat year-over-year at $2.6 billion, and up 3% sequentially. Turning to Imaging and Printing. Net revenue for IPG of $6.1 billion was down 10% year-over-year, with supplies revenue declining 12% as we reduced our channel inventory. We are now within our acceptable ranges for channel inventory on a consolidated basis, but the demand environment remains a headwind. Operating profit was $808 million or 13.2% of revenue, which is down 3.4 points year-over-year. These margins were impacted by the channel corrections, the supplies mix and the strong yen. Drupa, the international print media conference, was a successful event for us in March. We announced 10 new digital printing solutions that demonstrated our leadership in graphics. By business unit, commercial printer revenue was down 4% year-over-year, with commercial hardware units down 7%. Consumer printer revenue was down 15% year-over-year, with hardware units down 13% and total printer unit shipment volumes was down 11% year-over-year. Turning to the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business. Revenue of $5.2 billion was down 6% year-over-year, with the majority of the declines due to the hard disk drive shortage. Operating profit was $585 million and the operating margin of 11.2% was 260 basis points lower than the prior-year period. This was due to competitive pricing pressure in Industry Standard Servers and the lower mix of BCS, somewhat offset by the higher mix of Storage and Networking. Now let's dive into the ESSN performance by business. Storage revenue was up 1% year-over-year, with external disk revenue up 8%. StoreOnce revenue was up almost 100% and 3PAR revenue grew by more than 100%, surpassing EVA in size and making it our largest array business. In fact, combined, EVA and 3PAR grew 19% year-over-year. This growth was somewhat offset by declines in the non-disk businesses, including Tape. Overall, Business Critical Systems revenue declined 23% year-over-year and grew 4% sequentially. Within BCS, our mission-critical x86 revenue grew double digits, but BCS performance continued to be impacted by Itanium revenue decline. Industry Standard Server revenue declined 6% year-over-year, with almost all of the decline due to the hard disk drive shortage. Again, hard disk drive availability was uneven during the quarter. As supply availability improved, we had less of a mismatch between supply and demand than in Q1, and were able to deliver 4% growth sequentially. Going forward, ESSN should see minimal impact from the hard disk drive shortage. Networking revenue was up 2% year-over-year at $614 million, or up 4% when normalized for a divestiture in Q1. We continued to expand our presence in the data center segment and sustained double-digit growth year-over-year in Wireless LAN and security. We're confident that we have the right product portfolio, including our recently announced HP Virtual Application Network. Software delivered revenue growth of 22% year-over-year to $970 million. In the quarter, we saw 7% license growth, 17% support revenue growth and 72% growth in Services. Overall, second quarter operating profit for Software was $172 million or 17.7% of revenue, unfavorably impacted by acquisition-related integration costs and accounting adjustments, as well as a lower mix of license revenue in the quarter. The market and the competitive position for Autonomy remains strong, particularly in Cloud offering and the level of lead generation we are seeing across HP for Autonomy's Software and Services is compelling. But as Meg mentioned, license revenue this quarter was disappointing. Sales execution was a challenge and big deals are taking longer to close. HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the second quarter, financing revenue grew 9% to $968 million. Financing volume was up 5% year-over-year and net portfolio assets increased 4% year-over-year. Operating profit of $96 million was up 16% year-over-year to 9.9% of revenue. Now onto capital allocation in the balance sheet. Our focus is on rebuilding our balance sheet this year. HP's long-term strategy is to allocate capital where it will generate the best return on that investment. During the quarter, we returned $350 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $9.7 billion remaining in the share repurchase authorization. We also paid $251 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. HP generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter and free cash flow of $1.5 billion. Our total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $8.7 billion. In terms of working capital, our cash conversion cycle for the second quarter was 28 days, flat sequentially and up 3 days from the prior year. The longer cash to cash cycle from the prior year was due to an increase in inventory by 2 days and a 5-day decrease in days payable outstanding, somewhat offset by a 4-day reduction in days sales outstanding. We have work to do on bringing down our cash conversion cycle and are increasing our focus here. Now I'll get into the details of our restructuring. Our restructuring efforts will help build the long-term future of HP and is part of the multiyear effort to make HP a simpler, more effective company. We are addressing the trends in our businesses and the market by reducing our cost structure and realigning our workforce to create investment capacity, support growth initiatives and innovation, and enable more effective operations around the world. As part of the restructuring, we expect 9,000 employees to exit the company in fiscal '12 and cumulatively, approximately 27,000 employees to exit the company by the end of fiscal year '14. We are offering an early retirement program in the United States, so the level of nonvoluntary workforce reductions may be impacted by the number of employees that participate in that program. Although notifications will begin shortly, we expect minimal savings impacting Q3, with the majority of the fiscal '12 savings impact in Q4. We expect the restructuring actions associated with the charge to generate annualized savings in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion exiting fiscal year '14. To achieve the efficiencies, we will be investing in technology and business processes, as well as doing replacement and enablement hiring for new skill sets, in some cases, in lower cost locations. On top of the cost savings from headcount reductions, we expect further nonlabor savings from SKU rationalization, supply-chain efficiencies and price and promotion strategies. We expect to reinvest the majority of the savings from headcount and non-headcount related actions into our business to foster innovation, particularly in Cloud, Big Data analytics, Information Management and security. And now onto our earnings outlook. From a macro perspective, we remain cautious about the environment globally for both consumer and commercial spending. Second, we expect the pricing environment to remain competitive. Third, Services margins are expected to remain in the 10% to 12% range for the remainder of fiscal year '12. Fourth, we expect continued decline in Business Critical Systems revenue and the resulting pressure on ESSN margins. Finally, we expect OI&E to be at the low end of the previous guidance, an expense of $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year. With that context, we expect third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.94 and $0.97. If we were to exclude any impact of the restructuring plan we announced today, there would be no change to our previously provided non-GAAP EPS fiscal '12 outlook of at least $4. However, because the restructuring efforts are expected to create savings in Q4 faster than we can reinvest in strategic initiatives, we are increasing our fiscal year outlook to reflect the anticipated benefit in Q4. We now expect non-GAAP fiscal year '12 EPS to be in the range of $4.05 to $4.10. For GAAP guidance, in fiscal year '12, we expect to take a pretax charge of approximately $1.7 billion for the restructuring effort, of which roughly $1 billion will be in Q3. Through fiscal year '14, we expect to take additional pretax charges totaling approximately $1.8 billion. We expect the cash impact of the restructuring to be approximately $400 million in fiscal '12. Note that we expect to fund much of the cash payments associated with the early retirement program in the U.S. out of the pension plan. In addition, we are evaluating the carrying value of the Compaq trade name, which we acquired 10 years ago. Due to our plan for a more targeted use of the Compaq brand going forward, we expect to record a GAAP-only, noncash impairment charge of up to approximately $1.2 billion in the third fiscal quarter for the write-down in the value of the trade name. Thus, we expect third quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between 0 and $0.03 and full year GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.30. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Katy Huberty for Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Cathie, first, a question on free cash flow. The second quarter numbers were quite strong after a weak first quarter. But when you take into consideration the cash cost of the restructuring, where do you expect free cash flow to end this fiscal year relative to non-GAAP income?
Catherine Lesjak: So the way to think of -- we haven't been guiding cash flow. The way to think about cash flow over the long term is that cash flow will generally trend in line with our non-GAAP earnings. It is important to understand kind of the cash flow implications for the restructuring charge. In fiscal '12, we expect the cash flow impact to be about $400 million. And then through 2014, we expect the cash flow impact cumulatively to be about $2.7 billion.
Kathryn Huberty: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, do you have a view yet as to whether the share gains in PCs were entirely sellout or were some of that sell-in and channels rebuild after the HDD shortages? And just on the back of that, do you have a view around demand next quarter as the channel and consumers wait for Windows 8?
Margaret Whitman: I'll take that. So actually, we saw very good sellout in the channel and we are running at the low end of our desired channel inventory. So we feel pretty good about end-user demand and our ability to pull through that demand with good marketing and great product on the consumer side. And on the Enterprise side, I think we've actually struck that perfect balance between design and the workhorse devices that business and governments need. So we're feeling pretty good about demand.
Operator: Next question is from Bill Shope, Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Okay. Could you give us a little bit more detail on how you're thinking about the secular prospects for IPG, particularly in the consumer segment? And when you parse out this quarter's performance, how much of the supplies decline can we assign specifically to channel inventory reductions? And I guess an extension of that, do you still think we can return to sort of mid-teens margins anytime soon for overall IPG?
Margaret Whitman: Let me take the first part of that question, Bill. So listen, in terms of the broad secular trends in this business, what we see at the highest level is an enormous wind at our backs going from analog to digital. There's going to be about 200 billion pages that are going to move from analog to digital over the next number of years. But you're right. In some segments, there is some decline. For example, what we know is people who have home printers are printing less photos in their homes, but we also feel good about the printing in the Enterprise. So here's what we've got to do, and I'll let Cathie answer the question about supplies. As an industry leader, we need to act like one. We need to step up our marketing, we need to take responsibility for growing the category and demonstrating new use cases for printing. We need to get our pricing correct on both our ink, as well as our printers, and we need to make sure we've got the right product at the right time for the right market. In the Enterprise, we missed a cycle on multifunction Color LaserJet, and we now come to market this fall with 8 new multifunction printers in the LaserJet category, which is really going to help us. This is the fastest-growing part of the market that we haven't played in as much as we should have. And then we have to look at the different business models, particularly in emerging geographies. And in emerging geographies, what we found is that you can actually price the printer a little higher, price the print, the ink a little lower and what you end up doing is selling a lot more ink because printing is more affordable to these emerging markets. So we're going to get very aggressive in the printing business. We've got a very clear strategy outlined and I feel very good about the way forward there. It will take a few quarters to, I think, see the results of a more aggressive strategy, but I think we've got this one, so the path forward here is really clear now.
Catherine Lesjak: And, Bill, just to address the question on the supplies decline and how much of that was due to channel inventory, the vast majority of the decline was due to channel inventory corrections this year -- I'm sorry this quarter. And we do expect that, obviously, to modulate as we go into Q3 because we ended the quarter within our acceptable ranges on IPG supplies. Now, the caveat I give you is that demand continued to be fairly weak, and so honestly, we would like to take channel inventories down a little bit in Q3, nothing compared to what we were -- we did in Q2, though.
Bill Shope: Okay. And then the question on returning to mid-teens margins over time?
Catherine Lesjak: I think you have to go back and dissect, basically, where -- kind of what drove the margins this quarter. So if you actually look at it, there's kind of 3 big drivers of the margins year-over-year for IPG this past quarter. The first one is supplies mix, which was, as we've just addressed, was addressed -- was caused by both channel inventory corrections, which is the biggest impact, but also, we did see some softer demand from a supplies perspective. We also saw, obviously, lower volumes and that put some pressure on operating margins. And then finally, something that we, at this point, are not calling for a change and that's in the strength of the yen. That continues to be a headwind for us in our LaserJet business.
Margaret Whitman: I'll make one last comment on that, Bill, as well. Joining forces between the PC business and the printing business, this is going very well. And I think it's actually going to help the printing business a lot in a couple of areas. One is in emerging markets. PSG had a much broader and deeper footprint in emerging markets than IPG, so we're going to leverage that. PSG had a broader account coverage model, direct account coverage model than IPG did, so we're going to leverage that as well. And we have some untapped opportunities in supply chain, nodes, logistics that were not fully exploited because these were different divisions that didn't coordinate as well as they might have. So I think that's another reason where we're going to create some financial capacity, which over time, we'll invest in things that we think make sense and we'll obviously try to improve the margin over time as well.
Operator: Next question is coming from the line of Toni Sacconaghi from Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I know you stated several times that you expected the majority of your restructuring savings to be reinvested. If we take that quite literally and say 40% will actually drop to the bottom line, it's $1.5 billion or $0.60 a share after tax. Is that sort of the right framework that we should be thinking about? And I realize it's exiting 2014, but is that kind of the envisioned balance, given you used the adjective majority?
Margaret Whitman: So we are in the process of -- we have a very well-defined outlook, I think, for the savings that we will get through the workforce reductions and early-retirement programs. Cathie said, this is something in my script as well, with $3 billion to $3.5 billion. But you're correct. We are doing a lot of work on supply chain, SKUs and platforms, real estate, go-to-market, pricing and promotions, centralizing advertising and marketing, but we are not to the point yet where we can make a decision about how much of that we want to reinvest in the business because we are now wanting to take a very disciplined approach to say, what is the return on invested capital of an R&D initiative in the Storage business? So what I would recommend, Toni, is listen to our guidance going forward. There will not be perfect linearity in the savings and what we put into investment versus what we drop to the bottom line. So for example, in the fourth quarter, we may get a lot of these savings, but we want to be prudent on investment. But in Q1, we may invest more and bring a little bit less to the bottom line. So I think the best guidance I can give you is we're going to be very disciplined about reinvestment. We're not -- we're going to only reinvest in those opportunities that make financial sense to set up HP for the long term. And this will not be perfectly linear. But we'll -- I think we'll also be able to give you a little more guidance on this at the end of Q3 and the end of Q4.
Toni Sacconaghi: Okay. Talking about the nonperfect linearity, perhaps you can talk about forces at work on earnings in Q3 and Q4. I think your guidance, even if you strip out the incremental $0.05 to $0.10 from some of your initial savings that have not been reinvested, if we strip that out from the guidance, it still implies a 30-plus percent EPS growth from Q3 to Q4, which is sort of historically unprecedented at HP. Similarly, you're calling for earnings to be lower next quarter, despite not having the tailwind from further significant supplies reduction, not having the tailwind from -- excuse me, the headwind from that and not having the headwind from HDDs. So Cathie or Meg, maybe you can talk about forces at work on EPS that appear to be pushing down EPS in your view in Q3 and then leading to an unseasonably large expectation for EPS growth in Q4, even excluding the anticipated restructuring.
Catherine Lesjak: So Toni, actually, I'm a little puzzled by that because the math that we've done and the seasonality that we've looked at is that Q4 seems very much in line with normal seasonality off of Q3. And Q3 -- again pre-restructuring, and Q3 looks roughly in line with what we normally see from Q2. So we're really feeling like this is consistent with normal seasonality.
Toni Sacconaghi: So you don't expect any sequential benefits or -- I gather, what are the offsetting headwinds, the tailwinds that you should be getting from relief from no supplies channel draw-down and from better availability on the HDD side?
Margaret Whitman: Toni, it's Meg again. Let me copter all the way up here because, as I said, overall, we feel cautiously optimistic coming out of Q2, but I wouldn't say yet confidently that we have completely turned the corner. We have made real progress, but we are in the early stages of what we hope to achieve over the next several years. And the headwinds we're facing, I think, in Q3 and Q4 is first of all, Europe. I was just in Europe a couple of weeks ago, and I will tell you, every business leader over there is very concerned with the election of Hollande and what that will mean and what will happen to Greece. We are, as I said, at the early stages of a turnaround in a number of our different businesses. And in my experience, having done a number of these, turnarounds are not linear either. So there may be a setback that we can't anticipate at the moment. And then we're going through a lot of change here. We just joined forces of IPG and PSG, the Global Accounts now report to Dave Donatelli, we have centralized all of our marketing and communications, we've centralized sales ops for the first time under John Hinshaw, and we are undergoing a pretty big restructuring charge and our workforce reduction. So there's a lot of moving parts at HP. I feel confident about our ability to execute against that, but I don't want to get out over my skis in terms of what we tell you we can deliver.
Catherine Lesjak: And, Toni, I think you also have to play through a little bit on the currency. Now we are exposed to a huge basket of currencies, obviously, and we do a series of hedging -- different hedges across the different businesses. But at the end of the day, the currency that we're looking at right now is a headwind on a year-over-year basis in Q3 and for full year fiscal '12. On a sequential basis, it's minimal, but on a year-on-year basis, it is still a bit of a headwind from a top line perspective.
Operator: The next question is from Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Meg and Cathie, could you provide more color on sort of how you're thinking about the restructuring? I mean, is every business unit going to get sort of a percentage to cut? Does it include any potential divestitures of noncore businesses? And then finally, I'm just curious if you think the back office systems that you have in place right now will allow you to sort of manage through the process, because that's one comment that I've heard from people over time, is that they'd like to see a little bit more sort of on the back office system from an operations perspective.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me take a crack at that. I mean if you pull all the way back, our restructuring is really about 3 things: we've got to better align HP's cost structure with our revenue portfolio; we've got to position the company to take advantage of some of the biggest shifts that I've seen in technology in my 30-year career in business; and then we've got to streamline our operating model. And so the way we did this is we went business unit by business unit, and by that, I don't mean just at the ESSN level, I mean in Networking and the different projects -- products in Networking to the different PC categories to the different Services businesses that we're in to the different Software products, and basically said, what do we want to focus on? How many individuals do we need to deliver that service? What pieces of those businesses do we want to emphasize versus deemphasize, and came up with a bottoms-up approach to the cost savings that we thought we could achieve from the reduction in workforce, as well as the EERs, and then began to size things like supply chain and go-to-market that we talked about. Then you're right, we have to make some investments in this business, and internal tools and back-office processes are something that we need to invest in. It is not perfect by any means. And one of the steps we took was to combine our sales operations from both our Enterprise business and our consumer business under John Hinshaw, and we're finding lots of opportunities to streamline, to put tools in that will actually make it easier to work at HP. So we've got a lot of work to do in that regard. It is only one bucket of investment that we need to make. But when we do that, boy, I think you're going to see this company hum a lot more efficiently and effectively and be a lot easier place to work for the incredibly dedicated people we have working here.
Shannon Cross: Great. And then the second question I have is just on Autonomy. Can you talk a little bit more about the weakness in revenue, and if it changes your outlook on the business at all and how it integrates with HP or is this just something that some different oversight will fix?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So listen, when Autonomy turned in disappointing results, we actually did a fairly deep dive to understand what had happened here. And in my view, this is not the product. Autonomy's a terrific product. It's not the market. There is an enormous demand for Autonomy. It's not the competition. I was wondering, is there a competitor that we didn't see, and the answer to that is no. This is classic entrepreneurial company scaling challenges, and I have seen this movie before. When you try to go from $40 million to $400 million to $1 billion to $2 billion, boy, it takes -- it's a whole different ballgame. And we need to put in some sales ops processes, we need to put in better interface into HP in terms of how Autonomy interfaces with our Services business as well as our Service, Storage and Networking business, and we need a new organizational structure to support a $1 billion-plus company. So we have the people to do this, we have the expertise to do this. Something I'm extremely familiar with, having grown eBay from $4 million in revenues to $8 billion. I really have seen this movie before. And so I feel confident about the long haul, but it may take us a couple of quarters to work through some of the growing pains of the organization. But I think this was a very smart acquisition. I feel great about the product, and we have absolutely hit one of the scenes that is changing most in the Technology business. I mean, the opportunity around Big Data and analytics is fantastic and it can flow right across all of our businesses.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Marshall from ISI Group.
Brian Marshall: If we assume roughly $1 billion of the $3 billion to $3.5 billion savings goes to the bottom line when this is completed in fiscal '14 and the majority of that's going to be going to be going into the new focus areas, obviously Cloud, Big Data, security, is the majority of that $1 billion, would that go towards organic investment, and therefore, probably talking about a pretty sizable increase to the R&D, currently about $3.5 billion is spent annually on R&D. So if that's correct, would assume that we're not looking at any sizable M&A in these 3 areas as well going forward. And then I have a quick follow-up.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, Brian. I think that's a fair characterization. We're looking towards organic innovation or organic investment. We don't see any big M&A transactions on the horizon. There may be some tuck-ins, as I've said before, to augment our Software business or maybe some of our other businesses. But I think that's exactly right. This is a -- the heritage at Hewlett-Packard is a fantastic engineering culture, products engineering, service engineering, and the best payback I can see here is to put money into R&D for our engineers to create great services and products and software. So we are going to increase the R&D budget pretty substantially. We're also going to be looking at design and quality because that's another area, I think, that was a hallmark of HP. We need to have the very best quality in the industry across all of our products. And I think we have good quality, but I think we can do better there. We are going to make investments in our people, as I said, in terms of career training -- oh sorry, career development, training. We've got a lot of work to do there as well. And then I think Shannon had called this out. We've got some investment in internal systems that are going to allow us to be a lot faster and nimbler in the marketplace. Cathie, do you want to add anything?
Catherine Lesjak: The only thing I want to add is that there are a bunch of numbers thrown out there, and I just want to be clear on what those numbers really mean. So we expect to, as we talked about, to save, on an annualized run rate basis, between $3 billion and $3.5 billion exiting 2014, and it's from that pool of savings that we will look at reinvestment. And at this point, we're not quantifying for you how much drops to the bottom line. Some will definitely drop to the bottom line, but the vast majority will be reinvested back into this business, either in key growth areas where we can grow faster and higher margin categories or back into process reengineering, IT, automation, that will allow us to, frankly, continue to generate savings over the long haul because we're a much more efficient organization.
Brian Marshall: Sure. And the quick follow-up is with the extra moneys that are not reinvested in the organization, any change to capital allocation technology [ph] post the completion of the reduction of workforce?
Catherine Lesjak: So there's no change in our capital allocation focus, both in the short term or the long term. So on the short term, we've talked a lot about the fact that kind of 2013 -- oh sorry, 2012 and into '13, that our focus is on rebuilding our balance sheet. And we've made progress in Q2 in doing just that because our net debt position improved $1.2 billion, so we're making progress there. Over the long term, the way we think about capital allocation is basically looking at the different opportunities to deploy capital and what types of returns we can get, factoring in both long term and short term because we need some of both, but it's going to be a risk-adjusted returns basis. And frankly, share repurchase has to be on that list of our potential investments as well, because we've got to rack and stack all these investments on an ROIC basis. And so returning cash to shareholders is one of the highest return on invested capital decisions that we make, that we can make, and that's what we'll do.
Operator: Next question is from Keith Bachman from Bank of MontrÃ©al.
Keith Bachman: I had 2 questions, if I could. The first is on Services. You've identified that you want to take out a number of people out of the collective HP, yet at the same time, indicated that there's areas of Services, particularly on the consulting side, that you need to mature and grow. How do you think about the net headcount as you look at Services over that period that you've suggested, say 2 or 3 years? How do you look at the actual change in headcount and trying to provide the consultants and yet at the same time take cost out? And I have a follow-up, please.
Margaret Whitman: So we've talked a lot about the fact that Services is a turnaround and that it's going to take 3 to 5 years. And what we're doing is having a transition. We are transitioning our Services business from being heavily weighted to slower-growth, lower-margin portions or services within ITO, and we want to transition this to faster-growing, higher-margin sections related to strategic Enterprise Services -- well, what we consider strategic Enterprise Services, Cloud, security, Information Management and analytics and Application Modernization. And that's going to take us time to make that transition, but that is a big focus here. And at the same time that we're doing that, that obviously has headcount implications, so what we've done is we've basically modeled out that transition over a number of years and the types of skills that we need in order to execute on this transition. And I think it's also important to understand that that's kind of a mix. You can get better margins and services as a result of that mix shift, but it's not just about mix. We're also applying business process reengineering, lean methodologies to our delivery so that we also get a rate benefit on our installed base and obviously, on future contracts that we win.
Keith Bachman: Well, that's what I was alluding to Cathie, if I could just press on that before I ask my follow-up is, net-net, you need to add people, net-net over the next 2 years in Services, do you see headcount being up, down or flat? In Services?
Margaret Whitman: I believe we will have a smaller, more profitable Services business over the next 2 to 5 years, which will have fewer people in it today than it -- fewer people in it tomorrow than it does today because we will have changed mix to businesses but we can make a real -- we have a real differentiation in our offering.
Keith Bachman: Fair enough, okay. Then let me try -- my follow-on is on the Enterprise side. You've had 2 quarters of non-GAAP margins of about 11.2%. As the G8 and x86 side ramps a little better here with HDDs, would you expect the operating margins to improve over the next few quarters in that division? And that's it for me.
Catherine Lesjak: I think if you go back and you look at what drove kind of the declines year-over-year growth this quarter, that's insightful. So we did have lower top line growth that was driven partially due to hard disk drive shortages, which we believe, we are largely through exiting Q2. So minimal impact in the second half from the hard disk drive constraint. But we also saw softer economic demand, I'd say Europe in particular. And that's going to -- we're not calling in our guidance, at least at this point, for a significant improvement in that. We also have seen higher hard disk drive cost, which we expect will also continue through fiscal '12. And then finally, you've got the ongoing headwind from a lower mix from Business Critical Systems that will continue to put pressure on us. Now we've got some -- I would say, some different solutions for customers in that space, but we expect that to continue to put pressure on margins.
Margaret Whitman: And also to add one more thing, is that this is an area where, I believe, the return on invested capital and R&D is going to prove to be very high. This is sort of the core of who HP is, is our Server, Storage and Networking business, so we may see some organic improvement of operating margin, which we may choose to reinvest in R&D over the next several years. Because this is an area where, I think, we can be ahead of the curve in both our -- in Server, Storage and Networking, and you can start to see that in our results, I think. I mean even in Industry Standard Servers, which people say to me all the time, well, isn't that a commodity business? Not if we can help it. It shouldn't be. I mean you look at our next generation ProLiant -- Gen8 ProLiant servers, look at Moonshot, look at Odyssey. These are things that redefine that category and that's the kind of the thing we want to invest in.
Rob Binns: I think we've got time for one more question here before we pass to Meg for some closing comments. Operator, one more question, please.
Operator: Your final question is coming from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays Capital.
Benjamin Reitzes: Meg, you said something about China in your opening remarks. And I just want to make it clear that you said that the things were turning around there and that was a big headwind for you. And then you -- I just had a quick follow-up on end-demand for PCG, why you're so confident. So I'll ask you 2 at once.
Margaret Whitman: Yes, I mean -- again, I don't want to get out over my skis on China because we had a really tough couple of years in China, but it is looking better. There's a 6- or 7-tier distribution system in China, which we're feeling better about. We have a new head of APJ, Dion Weisler, who was in Beijing, who has a tremendous amount of experience. We have spent more time there. I think we are seeing the fruits of our labor in our China Development Center and our China Design Center. So I think we are seeing positive early signs of a stabilization and turnaround. We -- as I said, we announced our new product line in Shanghai for a reason because we wanted to show the commitment to the Chinese government, to the Chinese people for our long-term commitment to the China market. So I feel good about it, but it's early days and, as you know better than most, it's been a tough road for HP and China over the last couple of years.
Catherine Lesjak: And those are specific comments to PSG. I guess a couple other bright spots in China, in Industry Standard Server, we had a record quarter in China. So things are looking good there from a Networking perspective. We are continuing to really do well with our H3C products in China. There are bright spots. And then the sequential improvement on the PSG side is a positive direction as well. But to Meg's point, we'll take it kind of one quarter at a time.
Margaret Whitman: And we've got a fledgling but growing Services business in China. Iâve met with some of our biggest Services customers there, and actually, I think we have a good opportunity there. On your second question, which was end-user demand for PCs, gosh, everything we see in the marketplace says that there is a demand, there is a refresh coming, potentially around Windows 8. And it appears to be stronger end-user demand, I would say, in Asia and the United States. We still worry about Europe. Europe is one tough place to do business right now and my personal prediction is that this is going to get a little bit softer before it gets stronger, given all the uncertainties around the sovereign debt crisis, around what's going to happen to the Greek debt, about what's going to happen in France and what Germany is going to do to bail everybody out over there. So, okay. Well, let me just wrap up and sort of end where we began. I mean, overall, we feel cautiously optimistic coming out of Q2. And while I wouldn't say we've turned the corner, we have made real progress. And I think the entire senior leadership team at HP is increasingly confident in the way forward and in our future. So we're excited about continuing to execute over the next several quarters and years. So thank you very much for tuning in.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.

===== 2012 Q1  (2012-02-22 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Hewlett-Packard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your conference moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Fieler, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed.
Steven Fieler: Good afternoon. Welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call with Meg Whitman, HP's Chief Executive Officer; and Cathie Lesjak, Chief Financial Officer. Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. Please refer to the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's first quarter Form 10-Q. Revenue, earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including, among other things, amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. Comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in tables in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page at www.hp.com. Before I turn it over to Meg, I just wanted to briefly touch upon a financial reporting item. Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we review all reported segments and make any necessary changes to reflect any organizational shifts among our businesses. This year, these re-alignments resulted in the transfer of revenue and operating profit the Services, Imaging and Printing Group, Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking, Software and Corporate Investments segment and a transfer of revenue among the business units within the Services segments. In addition, we have reclassified certain costs previously reported as cost of sales as selling, general and administrative expenses to better align these costs with the functional areas that benefit from those expenditures. This reclassification of costs did not impact segment reporting and relates only to the line item within the P&L in which the costs are booked. A detailed reconciliation of the changes, including historical data, is available on our Investor Relations website as well as furnished on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. I want to be clear that the changes do not impact HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS. I'll now turn the call over to Meg.
Margaret Whitman: Thank you, Steve, and thanks to all of you for joining the call. Since I spoke to you last, I spent a great deal of time with our employees, our customers, partners and investors. Given some of the challenges of the last year, we've been working hard to set the right tone, calm the waters and reassure our stakeholders that HP is the same reliable company that they've known and admired for decades. I visited HP offices, hosting roundtables and employee meetings in Palo Alto, Cupertino, London, Vienna, Chicago, Houston, London and Alpharetta, Georgia. I spent some time with the sales force, communicated regularly with our senior leadership and worked very closely across the executive team. And I've been out with our customers. At HP DISCOVER in Vienna, we brought together more than 7,000 of our top enterprise customers in the biggest event in HP's history. And I participated in more than 80 customer visits, meetings and conversations. I've engaged with the channel through partner meetings, roundtables, interviews and, just last week, at the first-ever HP Global Partner Conference. So what have I found? Certainly, I found some skepticism. But I have also found that we have incredible support. People who believe in HP, people who want us to win, people who want to work with us and build for the future. And every day, I learn something new about our technology and innovation, our solutions, often just a story about the role HP has played in someone's life or a customer's success. It's inspiring. The more time I spend listening and learning, the more committed and passionate I've become. I've also gotten to know many of you, our investors. And just as I have with our other stakeholders, I'm working hard to strengthen our clarity and transparency. I want you to understand where we're taking HP and why. Most of all, I want to set HP on a path to continue to meet and exceed our expectations for the longer term. I believe we've started on that journey during the past few months, but we have a long road ahead of us. Back in November, we set the outlook. We said we had a lot of work to do, and we detailed the headwinds that were likely to pressure our business in 2012, including a hard drive shortage and an uncertain macroeconomic environment. In Q1, I think our performance, by and large, tracks pretty close to those expectations. The headwinds we discussed did impact performance, contributing to a decline in revenues, operating margins, cash flows and earnings year-over-year. That said, we met our guidance and delivered non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 and revenue of $30 billion. Frankly, it was a tough quarter, and every business had its challenges. In PSG, the hard drive shortage and continuing difficulties in China contributed to a revenue decline of 15% year-over-year. With the supply challenges, we focused on profitability rather than market share and did a good job of delivering an operating margin of 5.2%. PSG is important to HP. It gives us great return on invested capital and a lot of synergies. During the quarter, we also saw PSG returning to its roots as an innovation leader. With the introduction of the Spectre Ultrabook, HP won the prestigious Best of Show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas a few weeks ago. We need more of that. We need to keep driving innovation that generates desire and demand with our customers. The fact is that for all that's right with PSG, we underinvested in innovation for the last several years, and we've been late to market too often. We have to lead again. In Imaging and Printing, year-over-year revenues decreased 7% with declines in supplies and hardware in consumer and commercial. And operating margin declined to 12.2%. All of you know IPG has been the lifeblood of our company for a long time with great margins and very resilient revenues. And IPG is still a great HP business, the undisputed leader in the printing and imaging industry and well positioned to capture the shift from analog to digital. But we also have to recognize that the business is being pressured on multiple fronts, and revenues from our adjacent businesses, like commercial digital prints, are doing quite well, but not developing fast enough to replace the revenues we've been losing. We have work to do here and are aggressively exploring ways to build on IPG's leadership given the realities of today's marketplace. In ESSN, revenues declined 10%, and operating margins fell to 11.2% year-over-year. Industry Standard Servers revenue was down in a highly competitive environment that was compounded by the hard disk shortage. Business Critical System revenues also declined as we continued to address the Oracle Itanium situation. 3PAR delivered another terrific quarter; but in our broader storage business, we're still working through a product transition. And our networking business remains well positioned in a high-margin category. Although the overall market was challenging, we're really excited about some of the innovations we're bringing to our customers. We've launched some great new products like the ProLiant Gen8, the industry's most self-sufficient line of servers. We believe that this is just the type of game-changing innovation that can help us regain our momentum in the category. In Services, year-over-year revenues were up 1% while operating margins declined to 10.5%. This continuing margin pressure in Services really goes straight to a couple of our major challenges, like resource utilization and business mix. We're focused on transitioning to more profitable services while enhancing our systems, processes and sales force. Last quarter, we characterized Services as a long-term effort. That journey continues. In Software, with the addition of Autonomy, revenue grew 30% year-over-year with a 17.1% operating margin. The Autonomy acquisition is going well. And we're continuing to grow our set of assets from information management to our IT Performance Suite, including security, management of hybrid clouds and application life cycle management. Software is a critical part of our portfolio and of our forward-looking strategy. It amplifies, differentiates, optimizes and secures our core infrastructure, builds on our solution capabilities and expands customer relationships. For example, with an asset like Autonomy, we see potential synergies across the entire portfolio in IPG, ESSN, Services and in other Software assets like security. Now from a macroeconomic standpoint, we're seeing an uncertain environment. In the U.S., there are some signs of economic improvement, but we're still experiencing a weak consumer market and commercial customers who are investing cautiously. In Europe, the Middle East, Africa and APJ, conditions are mixed. We remain guarded about Europe, but some of the larger economies do seem to be stabilizing. When we last spoke at the end of Q4, I've been CEO of HP for about 8 weeks. Now coming out of Q1, it's closer to 6 months, and my perceptions of the business have evolved in that time. Some of that has to do with the external environment. But I also have a clearer picture of the work we need to do in our business. In my mind, I put the issues into 3 buckets. First is fixing our execution, ensuring we have the right systems, processes and people. This includes things like optimizing our supply chain, including SKU reduction, to remove unnecessary complexity from the way we design, manufacture and deliver products; upgrading our sales tools and systems to respond more quickly to customers; and increasing the productivity of our sales force by rationalizing our go-to-market. The second bucket is about addressing ongoing issues in each of our businesses, from IPG to PSG to ESSN to Services. We didn't make the investments we should have during the past few years to stay ahead of customer expectations and market trends. As a result, we see eroding revenue and profits today. We need to invest now as a market leader from a position of strength. And that's especially true because these businesses are not only under intense competitive pressure, but are also under pressure from tectonic shifts that are taking place at the very foundation of the industry. And that's the third bucket, how we deal with these industry shifts. We are at an inflection point where the delivery, consumption and business model for technology are all being redefined. Long-established profit tools are under pressure, and other profit tools are forming fast. We need to move quickly to capture emerging opportunities in areas like cloud, security and information management. We've already assembled some formidable assets. Now we need to align our portfolio to deliver a new generation of capabilities. We see a once-in-a-generation chance to define the future of technology and position HP as a leader for decades to come. But to seize this moment, we have to stabilize financial performance. That's really at the heart of any discussion of business fundamentals, generating enough profit to invest for the future and deliver solid returns for your investors, all underpinned by a disciplined capital allocation strategy. And it's clear, from both our revenue and margin profile, that our current cost base just isn't affordable. On the current trajectory, we just won't have the capacity that we need to invest. For years, we've been basically running our business in silos. And under that model, we built some of the leading franchises in technology, but it's also made us too complex and too slow. Yes, some of the obvious costs were dealt with in recent years, but there are still much more that we can do to streamline operations. Even more promising is what we can accomplish by tackling our business processes. We need to standardize, optimize and automate many of our processes, which will allow us scale the business without increasing costs at the same rate. We can also take a ton of complexity out of the system, improve our effectiveness and significantly reduce costs. It's not easy work and it's not a quick fix, but it holds the potential to improve the way we operate and execute, and it simply has to be done. We have got to save to invest. We have got to save to grow. In the near term, our focus remains on stabilizing the business, driving execution and getting back to basics, like aligning our cost structure with our revenue profile. Longer term, we'll invest to capture opportunities in cloud, security and information management that will position HP as a leader for decades. We have a lot of work to do. I've gained visibility into the business over the last few months, and I feel very good that we know the challenges, we know what we're going to do about them and we're headed in the right direction. After the time I've spent with our stakeholders, I am increasingly confident and optimistic about what we're doing. We have incredible strength and an incredible community of people who care deeply about HP. With their support, we've embarked on rebuilding HP in a thoughtful way that is true to the spirit of innovation, financial discipline and financial success that has defined this company. I have no doubt that we'll turn HP around. I look forward continuing our dialogue about HP's progress in the coming quarters, and I appreciate your continued support for our company. And with that, I'll turn it over to Cathie for some additional color on our Q1 performance.
Catherine Lesjak: Thank you, Meg. Let me review the details of the quarter, and then I'll provide some color on our outlook for Q2. Revenue of $30 billion was down 7% as reported or 8% in constant currency year-over-year. We estimated that more than 1/2 of the revenue decline was due to the hard disk drive shortage that impacted both PSG and ESSN. As you know, due to the flooding in Thailand that began last fall, the industry's supply of hard disk drives was about 30% below the expected demand in calendar Q4. Faced with this shortage, we made the decision to prioritize profitability, product performance and quality over shipment volume and market share. We expect the supply of hard disk drives will remain constrained for HP in Q2. In terms of our revenue performance by geography, revenue as reported was down 9% in Americas, 4% in EMEA and 10% in Asia Pacific year-over-year. All regions were impacted by the hard disk drive shortage. In addition, EMEA revenue was impacted by the macro challenges, and APJ's revenue decline was driven by the weakness in China. On a constant-currency basis, Americas, EMEA and APJ revenues were down 8%, 5% and 12%, respectively, year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 22.4% was down 210 basis points year-over-year and down 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margins continue to be impacted by the strong yen, a lower mix of ink supplies, competitive pricing in our hardware businesses and continued margin pressure in Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $4.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year. If we exclude the impact of the real estate gains that drove our operating expenses down in Q1 last year, operating expenses were essentially flat year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.6% was down 380 basis points year-over-year, and the company delivered $2.6 billion in operating profit. The bridge from operating profits to our earnings per share includes the following: other income and expense yielded a net expense of $221 million; our tax rate was 22%; and we used $780 million to repurchase 29 million shares, bringing our weighted average share count to 1,998,000,000 shares, which is down 10% year-over-year. As a result, we exceeded our guidance in the quarter, delivering non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.73. The majority of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in Q1 was amortization of purchased intangible assets. Now turning to our business units. The Personal Systems Group delivered revenue of $8.9 billion in the quarter, down 15% year-over-year, with a 5.2% operating margin. Total units shipped were down 18% year-over-year. Our Q1 shipment volumes in PSG were impacted by the hard disk drive shortage, and our performance reflects the choices we made to drive profitability and tightly manage inventory distribution. By segment, commercial client revenue declined 7% and consumer client revenue declined 25% year-over-year. Workstation revenue was flat year-over-year, desktop revenue was down 18% and notebook revenue declined 15% year-over-year. Moving on to Services. Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion, up 1% from the prior year quarter. Operating profit of $905 million was 10.5% of revenue, down 5.7 points from the prior year, primarily due to the cost of additional headcount in sales and service delivery. In the first quarter, IT Outsourcing revenue of $3.7 billion was up 2% year-over-year. Application and Business Services revenue was flat year-over-year at $2.4 billion and Technology Services revenue grew 2%. Turning to Imaging and Printing. Net revenue for IPG of $6.3 billion was down 7% year-over-year with supplies revenue declining 6%, partially due to our focus on reducing channel inventory. Operating profit was $761 million, or 12.2% of revenue, which was down 440 basis points year-over-year. These margins remain unfavorably impacted by the strong yen and an unfavorable ink supplies mix. Within the segments, we saw double-digit revenue growth in graphics and managed print services, and we shipped more than 5 million web-connected printers this quarter. We now have nearly 27 million web-connected printers in use around the world. By category, commercial printer revenue was down 5% year-over-year with commercial hardware units down 10%. Consumer printer revenue and units were both down 15% year-over-year, and total printer units shipped were down 13% year-over-year. Turning to the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business. Revenue declined 10% year-over-year to $5 billion due to the impact from the hard disk drive shortage and the continued weakness in BCS. Operating profit was $562 million, and the operating margin of 11.2% was 360 basis points lower than the prior year period due to reduced volumes and competitive pricing. Now let's dive into the ESSN performance by business. Storage revenue was down 6% year-over-year despite double-digit growth in StoreOnce and nearly 100% growth in 3PAR. Year-over-year declines in our base [ph] and EVA product lines offset this growth. Overall, Business Critical Systems revenue declined 27% year-over-year. Within BCS, our mission-critical x86 and NonStop products grew double digits, but not by enough to counteract the impact of continuing Itanium challenges. With respect to our Itanium portfolio, we are working diligently to enforce the commitments that Oracle has made to our customers and to HP. And our customers are excited about the capabilities of our new Odyssey platform, which allows enterprises to transition workloads off UNIX-based systems to mission-critical, Xeon-based x86 chips. Neither the storage nor BCS results were dramatically impacted by the hard disk drive shortage. However, we did see a significant impact on Industry Standard Server revenue, which declined 11% year-over-year. The hard disk drive shortage caused a mismatch between supply and demand, so we had demand that we could not meet in the quarter. Networking revenue was flat year-over-year at $586 million. We are confident that we have the right product portfolio and a total cost of ownership advantage to compete and win. Software delivered revenue growth of 30% year-over-year to $946 million supported by the acquisition of Autonomy. In the quarter, we saw a 12% license growth, 108% growth in services and 22% support revenue growth. Overall, first quarter operating profit for Software was $162 million, or 17.1% of revenue, unfavorably impacted by acquisition-related integration costs and accounting adjustments, as well as a lower mix of license revenue in the quarter. We are pleased with the Autonomy acquisition. The pipeline is strong, and the level of lead generation we are seeing across HP for Autonomy software and services is compelling. HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong, consistent results. In the first quarter, financing revenue grew 15% to $950 million. Financing volume was flat year-over-year, and net portfolio assets increased 8%. Operating profit of $91 million was up 15% year-over-year to 9.6% of revenue. Now on to capital allocation and the balance sheet. Our focus is on rebuilding our balance sheet this year. But HP's long-term strategy is to allocate our capital in a balanced manner between investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $780 million in cash to shareholders via share repurchases, leaving roughly $10 billion remaining in the share repurchase authorization. We also paid $244 million to shareholders in the form of dividend. HP generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter and free cash flow of $406 million. Our total gross cash at the end of the quarter was $8.2 billion. In terms of working capital, our first quarter cash conversion cycle was 28 days, up 7 days from the prior year. The increase was due to higher DSO and days of inventory by 2 days and 3 days, respectively, as well as a decrease of 2 days in days payable outstanding. Exiting the quarter, channel inventory was higher than our acceptable ranges due to impacts of the hard disk drive shortage on ESSN and soft sellouts in laser and ink supplies. Now on to our outlook. As we discussed last quarter, HP is managing the business to deliver earnings performance rather than specific revenue growth objectives. And we will continue to provide our earnings per share outlook consistent with this management approach. I'll wrap up with an update on the assumptions relating to revenue and earnings. We remain cautious about the macro environment globally for both consumer and commercial spending. In Q2, there will be an impact to revenue due to the hard disk drive shortage, although we expect the impact will be smaller in Q2 than Q1 based on the drives [ph] to which we have line of sight. We still have work to do in aligning our supply channel inventory levels with the current demand environment, and we will continue to see a headwind in Business Critical Systems due to the Itanium challenges. Moving on to margins. First, the expected year-over-year decline in revenue, including the impact from the hard disk drive shortages, will impact margins; second, we expect the pricing environment will continue to be very competitive; third, we expect to continue to have an impact due to a lower mix of Business Critical Systems revenue; fourth, the services turnaround continues, and we expect margins to continue to decline year-over-year. Fifth, we expect OI&E to be at the low end of our previous guidance, an expense of $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full year. And we will continue to invest in innovation and the systems and processes needed to improve performance across all of our businesses. With that context, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.88 and $0.91. We expect second quarter GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.68 and $0.71. We have not changed our full year FY '12 guidance. We continue to expect at least $4 in non-GAAP EPS and at least $3.20 in GAAP EPS. Now I'll turn it over to Meg for a few comments on the upcoming year.
Margaret Whitman: So to wrap up before going to Q&A, I'd really like all of you to take away these 3 messages. One, we're committed to clarity and transparency. We want you to understand the challenges and opportunities we have in front of us. Two, we are getting back to basics, driving execution, focusing on profitability through mix and costs and investing in our business with a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Three, we are building HP to last. We are not managing for short-term objectives. We are taking advantage of this opportunity to position HP for success, not for the next quarter, but for decades to come. And with that, I'll open it up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.
Benjamin Reitzes: My question for Meg is, it seems like a real tone change for IPG. Last call, you said that you thought it was economic and not secular, but it sounded like you said that there are some secular pressures impacting that. So I was wondering if you could comment and talk about that. And then I got to ask a follow-up already, is that if you could just talk about how you get to the full year guidance, because you -- you're in -- almost $1.80 in the first half, and you got to earn $2.20 in the second half to hit your guidance. So if you could just kind of talk about how you get there theoretically as well. That's my follow-up so I don't have to talk twice.
Margaret Whitman: Okay. Thank you, Ben. I appreciate that. I'll take the IPG question and Cathie will talk a little bit about the perspective we have on guidance for the remainder of the year. I mean, there's no question in IPG we face a number of challenges. And the printing market is more mature, and more mature markets tend to be governed with -- more by macroeconomic forces. And I'm convinced that a number of our challenges do relate to the macroeconomic challenges, weak consumer demand, weak small office-home office demand. The sell-through of ink, in particular, is at pretty low levels. And it's not just our ink, it's industry ink. That said, I think we've got to really look hard and say, "Okay, we may not see an overall secular decline, but we do see pockets of decline." What we know is that consumers at home are doing less photo printing, for example. That said, over time, I think that the analog-to-digital movement of print is actually going to advantage us. So we're steady as she goes here. We're going to think hard about how we accelerate the growth of some of our new businesses to compensate for the loss of ink. And we are going to work hard against -- we have headwinds from the yen, no question about it. And that is not a good thing. But fundamentally, that -- we're going to have to live with that. I mean, that doesn't really change quarter-to-quarter. So I think we've got a very realistic view of the challenges we face. It's a terrific business that has been, as I said in my opening remarks, the lifeblood of HP. But we've got some work to do to address ourselves to some of the secular trends and capitalize on this analog-to-digital growth.
Catherine Lesjak: And let me address the second question around our guidance. And it's really, I think, a question about our second half and why we would have confidence in the second half. And the first thing you got to look at is the normal seasonal patterns, basically the second half over the first half, because that is obviously a situation where the second half is typically better than the first half. And then as we've talked about, we expect to work through 2 big impacts and be largely through them by the time we enter the second half. The first one is the hard disk drive shortage. We believe that we will be impacted again in Q2 but to a lesser extent than in Q1, and that, that will be heavily skewed to ESSN and that we will be largely through that when we enter the second half. And similarly, on the supply channel inventory, given the current demand that we see, we expect to be through the correction in channel inventory supplies by the time we end Q2. So those -- obviously, if you take the fact that those have depressed the first half and we get to a more normal steady state in the second half, that gives you a pretty abnormal increase half 2 over half 1. And then the other things you really got to take into consideration is we launched new products. We announced the Gen8 server, ProLiant server, that will ramp through the course of the year. And then take Autonomy. Our plans in Autonomy is in the first half, it's really around getting Autonomy connected into HP, lead generation, lead qualification. And it's not until you start into the second half that you start to see some of the synergies that we expect from the Autonomy acquisition that both help obviously from a revenue perspective and a margin perspective. And then we continue to make progress on our execution, just basic blocking and tackling, just looking at our cost structure and realigning it to the business realities that we see today. And that helped us as well in the second half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.
Bill Shope: Cathie, I just wanted to follow up on that last part of your answer there. When you said you expected to return to sort of a normal steady state for IPG, I mean, how do we think about that steady state after this channel inventory correction given some of the secular commentary mentioned before? And how should we think about steady state growth, particularly in the supply segment going into the second half?
Catherine Lesjak: So I think that there are kind of 3 big impacts to IPG from a margin perspective, and that's really what I was talking about in terms of getting more back to a more steady state. You've got to take into consideration the fact that we do continue to expect and see a weak consumer demand environment. And that is a headwind for our ink supplies revenue. And while we expect it, some of that will continue, obviously, in the second half. We also have the strength of the Japanese yen, which is, on a year-over-year basis, continuing to impact our laser business and put pressure on that business' set of margins. And then as we work through this channel inventory correction, we do get back to basically growth in supplies more aligned with the demand that we see as opposed to the adjustments that we're making. And so we do expect that there'll continue to be a challenging demand environment with continued competitive pricing, but we don't have the same headwinds that we have in the first half.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I have one question and one follow-up. Meg, for you, I think if you look at market data and what competitors have reported, there's evidence of pretty significant share loss across all of your businesses. And your gross margins have also declined year-over-year and sequentially despite a favorable mix shift. So it really doesn't appear to be that you're ceding share to improve profitability because the numbers don't really support to that -- support that. So I guess my question is, this data appears to point to a widespread lack of competitiveness, and I'd like to get your assessment on whether you believe that. And if not, what might I be missing? And I know you've talked about stabilizing the business. What exactly does that mean? How do you measure that? And how long do you get there?
Margaret Whitman: Okay, good. So I'll -- I think you have to look at share loss by business. There is no question, with a shortage of hard disk drives in Q1, we prioritized profitability versus share in both Industry Standard Servers as well as our PSG business. And what you can see is we reported 5.2% operating income, which is actually at the high end of what we report normally. And we made a decision to prioritize profitable customers, profitable products and customers in profitable regions for us. And we think, by the way, we will be largely through the hard disk drive shortage for PSG as we enter into the second quarter, and we aim to gain share there. If you look at Industry Standard Servers, we didn't have the perfect match between the disk drives we needed and, therefore, we couldn't shape demand as fast as we needed to. In addition, we did prioritize profitability there as well. So those 2 businesses I'm not worried about an endemic share loss. I think that was, to some degree, driven by the decisions we made, which, by the way, I think were the right ones. If you look at some of our other businesses, we are experiencing share loss in printers and in ink. And I think that takes me to this notion of we've got really 3 big challenges at this company. And I don't know that I would say it's widespread lack of competitiveness. I'd say it falls in 3 buckets. It's our own execution. And whether that is things like turning orders into products faster than our competitors, I don't think we do that as well. Whether that is our supply chain, that if you back the supply chain all the way up to how we design our products, how we design quality in and how we manufacture those products. I think we're world class at how we buy components. I'm not sure I'd say we were world class in terms of how we think end-to-end about supply chain. Our systems and processes, we underinvested in those over the last few years. SKUs. We have an enormous number of SKUs in many of our businesses. And what you know is when you have a large number of SKUs, it leads to complexity in product launch, it leads to complexity in service and support and it leads to complexity in selling. So there's a number of things that I think we can improve quite dramatically. And I think some of our competitors do some of those things better than we do, and we got to get better across-the-board. And then in each of the BUs, there are very specific challenges. And each of the BU leaders, who are very experienced, very senior guys, are working hard to either reposition their business strategically, lower the cost of doing business so that we can compete more aggressively, bringing new products to market. A couple of our businesses from a product point of view are in the best shape I've seen in some time. So the PSG division, we've got some great products coming out from both the commercial as well as the consumer sector. And in ESSN, we've got some great stuff lined up. But each of the business unit leaders has to work hard to focus on the strategic challenges facing their business. And then we have got to make sure that we own 3 areas of what I would call the tectonic plate shift. And that is cloud, security and information management. So I think I'm -- I think we're being very straight up, saying we've got some real challenges ahead. The good news is, I think we understand the challenges. We've got a plan in place, and now we just have to go execute. And -- so by doing that, we will stabilize the business, and we will create enough financial capacity to sustainably invest.
Catherine Lesjak: Okay, let me just -- I think Meg did a great job of commenting on the operating profit for PSG, which I think is a really strong result given the kind of volume changes and declines that we saw year-over-year. From an ESSN perspective, we were also heavily impacted by volumes as well as soft demand. But the other thing that you've got to take into consideration is that we had hard disk drive price increases that obviously hurt a bit. And then also, the fact of the matter is because we didn't have the hard disk drives that we needed to meet all the demand, we actually were shipping server configurations that were less richly configured. And so it doesn't just impact the top line, it also impacts the bottom line. And then as we've been talking about now for the last couple of quarters, we have been seeing a lower mix of Business Critical Systems revenue, and we do expect that, that will be a headwind going forward.
Toni Sacconaghi: And then -- I appreciate that color. So when you both mentioned this concept of stabilizing the business, what do you mean? Does that mean you are holding or gaining share in your businesses? Does that mean you are growing faster than what you believe your addressable markets are in revenue terms? Does that mean you're growing in absolute terms? What specific -- well, how will investors know that you have stabilized the business? And what is the time frame that you think for getting there?
Margaret Whitman: Let me take a crack at that, Toni, and then I'll let Cathie also answer. So the first thing we have to do is stop the revenue decline. A formula for success here is not having revenue declines of negative 7% to 8% in constant currency. So the first step with stabilization is stop the decline. The second is then we have to start growing revenues again, and the only way that we know how to do that is you've actually got to gain share in virtually every single market. And you've got to gain share because a lot of these markets is in technology, right? The unit cost or the unit price is going down, so you have to sell more units to maintain your revenues and grow your operating margins. So from a time perspective, Cathie will comment on this, I would hope that as we get through 2012 and enter 2013, you'll start to see the revenue decline flatten out. And then hopefully, as we get into 2013, by the end, you'll start to see us grow revenue. It's very hard to predict. I think it depends on how fast we can get after some of these challenges in the business. It depends, obviously, on what the market does. It depends on the macroeconomic environment. But a lot of this is in our own hands. And so we've got to move fast, quickly and decisively to get after some of the execution challenges that I described.
Catherine Lesjak: I think the only thing I would also add in terms of evidence of us stabilizing is the fact that we let you know what our outlook is, and then we deliver to it. And the more consistent we -- consistently we do that, it's -- implied underneath that is a much stable business environment.
Margaret Whitman: The other thing I'd say, Toni, is if you look at business history and you look at companies that have gone through the kind of turnaround that we're leading HP through right now, these things are not quick. It took us a while to get into this situation in which we find ourselves. It's going to take us a little while to get out. And if you look at history, these turnarounds are not done in less than 2 years, and often they take 3 or 4 or 5 years. So I think you've got to -- and by the way, you'll see, obviously, forward progress before 5 years, of course. But we've got a journey ahead of us. And as I said, it took us a while to get into this, it's going to take us a while to get out. But I can tell you how good I feel about our strategy. We know what to do. We've got a plan to do it, and now we have to execute.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
Kathryn Huberty: Speaking of stabilizing revenue growth, how are you assuming that Windows 8, Romley and Ultrabooks might impact your ability to stabilize your business and see better seasonality in the back half of this year? Are any of these significant enough in fiscal '12 to impact the business?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. Listen, we feel good about Windows 8. As you know, we have a product line lined up in PSG on Windows 8, on x86. We've gotten great reviews to our first ultrathin product. And we believe Windows 8 -- we're going to be well positioned for holiday on Windows 8 x86. And so I think that will certainly help PSG. Listen, the better Windows 8 is, the better off we are. So we're rooting for a fantastic Windows 8 product that's delivered on time that we can get to the market before the holiday season. So I think it's a help. You have to remember that PSG is only a part of our entire portfolio. So it will help PSG. It doesn't have an impact on a number of our other biz.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Yes, could you help us understand why the HDD disruptions seem to have a disproportionate impact on your business relative to your competitors? I think, Cathie, you called out 1/2 the revenue decline due to the HDD constraints. That's $1 billion in revenue. I think it's 7% of your PC and enterprise hardware. So I understand your PC margins at 5.2% were decent, but profits were still down 30%, and your x86 performance was worse than your competitor's. So I guess what is it about the supply chain, which is the biggest in the world, that has put HP at a disadvantage seemingly? And what are you doing to address it?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So the hard disk drive shortage had a significant impact on our revenue in Q1, as Cathie described. And the industry supply of hard disk drives was about 30% below the expected demand. So this had an impact on everyone. And we chose -- as I said, with the supply challenges, we focused on profitability rather than share. And ultimately, I think we were not as advantaged as I might have anticipated given the scale of our supply chain. I will say it was a remarkably fluid situation. The shortage impacted different suppliers, different drives. Trying to match the drives that you've got with -- versus the drives you ordered with demand matching in the marketplace was really tough. But we were not as effective as we needed to be in matching that supply with our demand. And so I think it showed us, it certainly showed me, that we have some challenges in our overall supply chain. And I would say the other thing is, we've got to get better at taking an order and turning it into a product in our factories and getting it to customers. We can shrink that total elapsed time, and we were not benefited by having a slightly longer time frame of order from factory floor to customer as we could have been. So you're right, we were not as advantaged as I anticipated, and I think there were some ahas there for us in terms of things that we need to do to our broadly defined supply chain. And as I said at the beginning, I think we're world class at buying products. But if you look at supply chain all the way from design to delivery, I think there are some opportunities [indiscernible].
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Meg, can you talk a bit about how you're interacting with your direct reports and what changes you've made in terms of how they interact with each other as perhaps you try to break down the silos or how the various leaders fix their specific businesses?
Margaret Whitman: Yes. So I think one of the things that the team has done very well since I arrived is we now actually are a team. We have a cadence and a rhythm around how we meet, about what we talk about. It is everyone is involved. Every single business unit leader and major functional head is involved in the strategy going forward, what we're going to execute on. We have very lively discussions about things we need to focus on. And then decisions are made, and we work together to get those done. So I couldn't be more pleased with how the team is working together. And then I built very strong relationships with each of the BU heads, and we, I think, have good alignment about what needs to be done in each of those business units. So I think it's been -- if you were to ask the senior team, I think you would hear that it was a pretty big change from previous management in terms of the amount of time that we work together, the decisions we make collectively and how we are working as one HP. And one particular area that I'm focused on is how do we bring this product portfolio, which is among the very best in the industry, to customers as one HP. And as I said, we've run this business in a quite siloed way, which had some really good benefits. I mean, we built huge world-class businesses, but particularly the top customers now, they want to buy from one HP. We've got to get really good at bringing those products, getting the pricing right in a way that we have not done in the past as well as we might have. So we're on a great path, and I think the EC members, if they were on this call, would tell you it's about as good as it's been for a number of years.
Catherine Lesjak: So I would definitely weigh in and say that.  And I think there's been a lot written about us moving out of our offices into cubes. And I think that makes -- just made a huge difference. I can tell you that I've spoken more frequently with all of the different folks on Meg's staff more frequently in the last 2 months than I probably did in a whole year because you're just so much more visible, you know who's in their office and available and you do a lot more casual kind of over-the-cube wall quick discussion.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: I have questions. I want to return to printers for a second. And the first one is Cathie, can you go back to inventory for a second? In the previous call, there were comments that supplies inventory was too heavy, so to speak, and yet sequential growth was actually up in the January quarter by 1%. In the last 2 years, it's been down 7% to 8% sequentially. So supplies actually went up, and I want to try to understand. Can you give us some perspective on what is the status of the extra inventory? Why was it up? And when does it run out? And the second related question is, the mix of supplies to total revenue in printers was about 65%, which is consistent to what it was in the January 2011 quarter and the January 2010 quarter. Yet, each of those past quarters, operating margins were in the mid-16s. So I'm curious as to why profits wasn't better in this quarter given the mix that I just described.
Catherine Lesjak: So in terms of the channel inventory level, there were -- there are a couple of different dimensions that are going on and they're different, whether you're talking about ink supplies versus toner supplies. And so we did make progress on reducing ink supplies, channel inventory, basically from Q4 to Q1. And that's one of the impacts on the margins, why margins are down a bit on a sequential basis. On the toner side, we actually had a price increase. So we had a little bit -- not a massive but a little bit buy-in. And so we did not get the reduction in channel inventory in Q1 that we had expected. We do still expect that the channel inventory levels will exit Q2 in acceptable ranges for supplies. And that is fully included in our guidance. And then just to go back again to the margins, if you look at supplies mix, you arrive at the 65%, up a little on -- sequentially and up a little year-on-year. But it's really important what that mix is. And it is -- the mix is skewed much heavier to toner, which has significantly different gross margins than it is to ink jet or ink. And that's driving a fairly large impact on margins, both year-over-year and sequentially.
Margaret Whitman: I'd add one comment to this, is that, as I said, this is one of the great all-time businesses and has been the lifeblood, as I said, of HP for many years. But there are definitely some market shifts occurring, and we've got to create the capacity financially to improve profits in this business, but also create the capacity to invest in innovation more aggressively than we have. This is all -- IPG was always the go-to place for more money at HP. And so we've got to create capacity to sustainably invest in innovation and, frankly, to market again because if we don't continue to invest in marketing, we are going to end up in a situation where our business is being more commoditized than I would like. And then lastly, from a profitability point of view, the yen is a real problem. And you know how this is. Basically all of our supply of LaserJets is denominated in yen. So when the yen moves against us, it has actually a pretty big effect. And I don't know if you want to say anything more about that, Cathie.
Catherine Lesjak: Well, just -- I will just add that if you look at the yen increase year-over-year, it's like 7% Q1 2012 versus Q1 2011. And during -- it's been increasing over the last couple of years, and we've actually been able to absorb much of that cost -- those cost increase until, I think it was 2 or 3 quarters ago, when it just became increasingly difficult that we couldn't take the costs out fast enough to offset the appreciation in the yen.
Operator: All right, our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: I was just hoping, Meg and Cathie, to get an update on the progress for Services investments and just get a sense for why the margins continue to trend lower in this business? And why -- and where is the bottom in Services margins? So what do you think is the level where you can invest sufficiently to turn this business around and not see further degradation?
Margaret Whitman: So Cathie, why don't you talk about the margins and then I'll follow back with sort of the more holistic view of where we are with this business?
Catherine Lesjak: Sure. So the performance that we delivered was in line with the expectations that we set last quarter, and I think that, that's an important point. So I -- there shouldn't be any surprises here on that. Revenues in Services did grow 1%. It was flat on a reported basis, it was flat in constant currency, while the cost structure increased due to the necessary investments that we've been talking about in service delivery and basically building out our bench and in investing to build out our strategic enterprise services. And I put -- the services that we put in that category are services around cloud, analytics and security as well as apps modernization. And those are the higher-growth, higher-margin services that we need to invest into and convert this business from being less ITO heavy, where the margins are not as good and in some service lines within ITO, the margins are very unattractive and we're deemphasizing some of the revenue in that space. So we are on a long-term turnaround. We are making progress. And for this specific quarter, combined with the investments that we're making with sales and delivery, we did see margin compression from contract renewals. I think that the Services people will probably tell me that 100% of the contracts that are renewed come in at a lower price, but I'll say almost all. And the goal, obviously, is to be able to be nimble enough to take costs out quickly enough to offset that price compression that you get on renewals and/or sell a bigger basket of services. And we're making investments in both processes as well as IT in order to increase our ability to take costs out quickly, especially in the resource management space. So we expect -- if you look at the outlook for '12, we do expect that year-on-year, margins will continue to be down.
Margaret Whitman: I think Cathie actually said it well. I don't have much to add. I just think at the highest level, the way you have to think about our Services business is we are going through a multiyear turnaround with a focus on rebuilding the business and dramatically changing the mix of our business. And this takes time. And we have also got some investments that we have to make there. We've got to have some new IT systems and processes to better manage the business, we've got to improve the performance and satisfaction in many of our existing accounts and we've got to enhance the sales specialists and service delivery personnel to support future revenue growth and operating income growth. So we're on a path. Again, I think in some ways, Services, we know what the problem is, we've got a plan and now we've got have to deliver on that plan. But I'll be very honest with you, this is a multiyear journey. This is not a quick fix. And frankly, this dates back, in my view, to the assets that we acquired back in 2008 and then ran right into the 2008, 2009 global slowdown and we took a lot of costs out of this business. And we're paying the price for that in many ways in terms of some of the capability that needs to be built back into the organization. That said, I think it's a very important strategic asset for the company. Many of the roles that Services needs to play in terms of the wrapper around our infrastructure products, our software products, this has to be our solution selling arm. And so we're committed to rebuilding this, but we've got a multiyear journey ahead of us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with UBS.
Maynard Um: Just a couple of questions. Can you just talk about any particular verticals where there was strength or weakness, both from a demand and pricing pressure perspective? And then the second question is it sounds like in some areas, HP is making more of a shift to focus on services and solutions inside the channel, which has been primarily accustomed to being more transactional. Can you just talk about the feedback from the channel and if there are any sort of significant changes that have to happen for them to find success in this new model?
Margaret Whitman: Yes, let me talk about the channel. I just got back, as I said in my opening remarks, from our global channel conference in Las Vegas. And boy, this is one great group of small- to medium-size businesses who have, for many years, made their living betting on HP. And boy, do they want us to win. And what they need more than anyone -- anything else is stability, steady hand on the tiller and some predictability around what we're going to do. So much of 2011 was not an uplifting experience for them. And so I think we went a long way towards explaining the product road map, explaining where we were headed as a company and how they fit in and how much, in particular, I respect the channel. Because they are looking -- does the CEO actually love the channel or are they indifferent? And I told them I was an enormous booster of the channel. First and foremost, they sell products. They still sell products. But increasingly, they -- as they told me, they're looking to sell solutions as well, and we need to help them get there. And whether that's cloud, whether that's security, ultimately information management, they're -- we're going to try to help them sell more services. But I will -- and sell more services and solutions. But they still, first and foremost, want to know that we have the very best server product, that we've got great networking, great storage and that they can, with confidence, go to their customers and sell that product. By the way, the PSG uncertainty last year disproportionately affected this channel. They were terribly worried. What did that mean for them? What did it mean for HP? What did it mean for hardware? So I think we've gone a long way towards calming the waters and explaining that in fact, we're really proud to be an infrastructure and hardware company. That doesn't mean we're not going to sell solutions, but I think we went a long way towards restoring their confidence. And I can tell you that, that business is all about the confidence they have in us.
Steven Fieler: Operator, we have time for just one more question.
Margaret Whitman: We had a question about vertical. I don't think there was really anything notable, Cathie, about whether we did particularly well in airlines versus pharmaceuticals versus travel. I don't think there was anything particular that drove our results in that regard.
Catherine Lesjak: No, I don't think we have anything specific to call out there.
Operator: All right, our final question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
Kulbinder Garcha: I just have a couple of questions, one, I guess, for Meg on the whole -- I have seen a number of comments that you've made today and also in the past about underinvestment. On the other hand, you speak about streamlining processes. I'm just trying to think. What does that -- all that mean for the levels of OpEx that HP are at today? And do you actually think you can go to this transition and keep this OpEx level over the next couple of years? Or you have to build higher? And then a question for Cathie just on the free cash flow. The conversion itself was very poor as well this quarter. I think it was about 20% of your net income got converted to free cash flow. Was there any onetime items in there that won't be there recurring going forward? So I'm trying to think the speed at which your balance sheet was -- will rebuild as you actually start doing more distribution to shareholders over the next 12 to 24 months.
Margaret Whitman: Well, we have a strategy here that I've seen work many times before. In fact, I've led changes like this, which is -- and let me sort of say succinctly, we have to save so we can invest. What we cannot do is keep our current level of costs and just layer investments up on top of that. We've got to streamline our processes, we've got to optimize our supply chain, we've got to reduce SKUs, we've got to rationalize our go-to-market so that we can save money in the OpEx line so that we can then reinvest in the -- growing product lines, we can invest in our fast-growth businesses and we can invest in innovation. So what never works in business is, "Let's keep our cost structure the same and just layer investment on top of that when we're in a situation in which we find ourselves." So my view is save to invest, save to grow. And we're very mindful that as we operate more efficiently and effectively, some of that money needs to drop to the bottom line, and some of that money needs to really reinforce the strategic initiatives that we have to grow the business. And I think, as Toni asked me earlier in the call, stabilize declining revenues and begin to gain share in the categories in which we compete. And listen, I've done this a number of times in my career. It's what great business leaders do, is figure out how to run things more efficiently so that they can make the investments. It's not as easy as hey, let's just make more investments.
Catherine Lesjak: And then from a cash flow perspective, as you may recall, we pay our annual bonuses in Q1. So we accrue the expense for that bonus in the previous year, and then the first quarter of the next year, we basically pay the bonus. So it is typical that Q1 is a low-cash-flow quarter for us.
Margaret Whitman: Great, I think that was the last question. So listen, thank you for joining us today. I remain incredibly optimistic about the long-term future of HP. We've got a lot of work to do, but we've got a great team and a great, I think, really the best understanding of the situation in which we find ourself and how we're going to lead through it. So thanks very much for being on the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2010 Q1  (2011-02-23 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentleman, and welcome to the First Quarter 2010 Hewlett-Packard Earnings conference call.  My name is Michael and I will be your conference moderator for today’s call.  At this time, all participates are in an listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of the conference.  (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Steve Fieler, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please proceed.
Steve Fieler: Good afternoon.  Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call with Leo Apotheker, HP’s  CEO and Cathie Lesjak, HP’s CFO. This call is being webcast.  A replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially.  Please refer to the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including our most recent Form 10-K. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Q1 Form 10-Q.  Earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain items including amortization of purchase and intangibles, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations webpage at www.hp.com. I'll now turn the call over to Leo.
Leo Apotheker: Thank you, Steve.  When I come to see you, one of the most commonly asked questions has been what does HP do well, and where does HP need to improve.  With one full quarter under my belt, I now have an insider’s perspective on the answer. For starters, I’m convinced that we have the core strength to deliver for our customers, partners, employees, and shareholders.  When you look where the market is heading with cloud and connectivity converging, HP is well positioned to win. I’m confident in our future and our ability to execute effectively.  I’m also confident that our business model can sustain our earnings power. Our Q1 results demonstrate the powerful operating leverage and diversity of our portfolio.  We grew revenue 4%, gross profit 10%, operating profit 14%, and cash flow from operations and EPS were both up over 20%. We have a business model that benefits from scale and leadership in our core businesses.  And we have an evolving portfolio mix with higher-margin businesses such as networking, helping to extend company gross margins. As we discussed during our last earnings call, gross margin expansion allows us to invest for future growth.  If you want operating profitability, it was in dollars and percentage, what’s strong and demonstrated sound financial discipline.  But, our Q1 results also show that there are opportunities to improve our growth in a few isolated areas. Despite strong profitability and cash flow in the quarter, we did not meet our top-line growth expectations, and I’ll provide some specific color on PSG and services. Let me start with PSG which declined 1% year over year.  Going into the year, we made a few assumptions about the PC market in our business.  First, we assumed that we would enhance our number-one share position.  Indeed, in the most recently reported calendar quarter, HP grew it’s worldwide sequential share in every category; consumer, commercial, desktop, notebook.  HP holds the number-one share in both desktops and notebooks. Second, we assumed that we would capitalize on the growth in the commercial markets.  Again in Q1, we grew commercial PC planned revenue by 11% year over year showing good growth in each region.  We also assumed that they would execute a recovery plan in China.  In Q1, we grew our PSG China revenue 25% sequentially.  We’re showing good progress but there still has work to do. Finally, we assumed that we deliver growth in consumers.  Unfortunately, this did not play out in Q1 due to softness and the overall consumer PC market.  Our consumer PC client revenue went down 12% year over year.  PSG continues to demonstrate solid execution, leveraging its portfolio breadth, geographical reach and customer diversity. Despite a soft consumer market in PCs, PSG’s operating profits increased 27% year over year delivering 6.4% operating margins. And most importantly, I am very pleased with our February 9, WebOS announcement.  We are all excited about our WebOS platform, the devices and that we announced and the incremental opportunity that WebOS provides.  The enthusiasm and the anticipation for WebOS exceeds even our most optimistic expectations.  We look forward to providing a differentiated seamless experience across our tablets, Smartphones, printers, PC’s and future phones. Moving to services, we had a mixed performance in the quarter.  Again, we made a few assumptions going into here.  We assumed that we would increase long-term signings, helping to solidify a steady annuity-based revenue stream. In Q1, we achieved this goal delivering solid signings, including a $1.4 billion deal with [inaudible] and a record number of mega deals, each greater than $100 million total contract value.  We also assumed growth in HP product pull through with Enterprise Services.  In Q1 we continue to show strength, growing our pull-through double-digit year over year. Finally, we assumed that our project-related short-term higher value-added services would generate a relatively higher growth rate than the rest of our services before you.  It is consistent with the expected market growth rates for value-added services.  But in Q1, we did not achieve our expected level of short-term signings or project-based revenue.  This impacted both our application services and our IP revenue for the quarter. We have a significant opportunity in services.  In fact, when I meet with customers they’re asking HP to increase our relationship with them whether it be helping them to consolidate data centers, modernize their applications, or transition to hybrid cloud environments. So what are doing to improvement our growth and higher value added services? We’ll continue strengthening and enhancing our sales and delivery capabilities.  The services transformation efforts announced last year was to ultimate and improve our prophesies and tools, which we expect to result in better competitor position in the market. We’ve made good progress on new service offerings like our one-day cloud development workshop where HP Cloud consultants work with customers to make the options of their computing. We’ll continue to improve our higher value-added service offerings and ability to serve and delivery with long-term and short-term signings. We have a real opportunity to drive more value to our customers and that’s what we’re focus are doing. Q1 demonstrated the power of HPs robust portfolio in our existing core businesses as well as new products and innovation. In addition to our successful WebOS Lounge, we achieved other highlights over the past quarter, giving us another strong quarter.  Our networking business continues to be an exciting opportunity, it’s a big market.  It has good margins and we expect to continue gaining shares.  In services and storage we’re demonstrating how innovation like grade-system metrics, Virtual Connect, and StoreOnce is driving growth. We also demonstrated that we can integrate best of our technology into HP with a [inaudible] acquisition off to a strong start.  The recent security acquisition in software, both ArcSight and Fortify, are also off to a strong start. Enterprises are going through a transformation with the customization of IT and the shift to cloud computing. With our integrative management and security offerings, HP provides a completely different approach to enterprise security and compliance, and our software security portfolio has a strong performance in Q1. In January, we announced several new cloud solutions including our ECS-compute.  This is an enterprise cloud service offering bringing a new paradigm of computing to businesses.  We’ll leverage our strength of HPs skill enterprise security and liability and our unique ability to manage hybrid IT and volumes. Last week, we announced our intent to acquire Vertica.  With this acquisition, we will strengthen our capabilities for information optimization, adding real-time business for big data.  Just like we have with other acquisitions, we’ll use our skill and reach to acquire Vertica’s growth.  At the same time, there’ll be new value to HP customers in our ecosystem. IPG continues to innovate and execute strategy, delivering another strong quarter with the 7% revenue growth and share gains in both later and ink.  It was a balanced performance across regions driven by strength and commercial.  Commercial units were up 33% year over year, and graphic arts posted strong double-digit growth. As I stated in my opening remark, HP is well positioned to lead the IT industry.  If you use Q1 as a marker, it’s clear that we do a lot of things well at HP.  But it’s also clear that we have isolated areas that we need to improve, and I’m committed to making these improvements to increase growth and operational excellence. As you all know, I’ll be hosting a strategy seminar on March 14, in San Francisco.  Here’s what you should expect from the event.  I’ll go over HPs strategy and how it will continue to evolve.  I’ll talk about the opportunities we see in a more seamlessly connected world from the enterprise to the consumer, leveraging our strength in cloud and connectivity, and the portfolio of hardware, services, software, and solutions we need to make that happen. For those of you who will be in person, you also have the opportunity to interact with many of our senior leaders.  It’s not a meeting where we lay out long-term financial plan or guidance, it’s a discussion of where we see the market going, why HP’s uniquely positioned, how we expect to win.  And the March 14 summit will be my first chance as HP’s CEO to engage with many of you in person, and I very much look forward to seeing you there. I now hand the call over to Cathie.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Leo.  HP continued to demonstrate disciplined execution in Q1.  We added over $1 billion of revenue growth, expanded gross margins and operating margins, grew earnings per share by 27% year on year, and generated $3.1 billion in cash flow from operations. Before I get into the details of the quarter, I want to review our annual reclassification process.  Each year, as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make changes across and within the reported segments to reflect organizational shifts between the businesses. This year, we’ve made several changes that I will now highlight for you.  As I told you in the fall, networking has moved into the renamed, enterprise service, storage, and networking segment from corporate investment.  In addition, the communications and media solutions business transferred from HP Software to Services, and the Business Iintelligence business moved from HPs Software to Corporate Investment. A detail bridge of these changes, including historical data, is available on our Investor Relations website, as well as furnished on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC. I want to be very clear that this an annual process designed to align our financial reporting structure with business changes and that the changes do not impact HP’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings, or EPS. However, in the interest of complete disclosure, we felt it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call.  With that, let’s review the details of the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $32.3 billion up 4% from the prior year.  We continue to see good performance in our commercial hardware businesses led by strength in converged infrastructure and commercial printers and PC’s.  We posted solid double-digit revenue growth across these businesses with Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking growing 22% and Commercial Print Hardware, and PSG Commercial Revenue increasing 13 and 11% respectively. Looking at our results by geography.  Revenue in Americad and Asia-Pacific increased 6% and 7% respectively while revenue in EMEA was flat year on year.  Excluding China, Asia-Pacific achieved double-digit revenue growth.  On a constant currency basis we saw balanced growth with revenue up 5% in the Americas, 4% in EMEA, and 2% in the Asia-Pacific region. Gross margin in the first quarter was 24.4% up 1.5 points from the prior year demonstrating the company’s ability to sustain gross margin expansion as we outlined at our analyst day in September. The increase in gross margin was due to a favorable mix of HP networking and PSG and to a benign commodity pricing environment. Turning to the expense side.  Total operating expenses were $3.9 billion including the benefit from net gains primarily associated with the real estate sale announced previously. Excluding these net gains, operating expenses were $4.1 billion increasing year over year due to both investment in R&D and sales coverage and as a result of acquisitions.  We will continue to be prudent in our investments and actively monitor their progress.  These results demonstrate our ability to modulate our expenses in a way that enables us to balance investment in the businesses while delivering strong results to shareholders. Non-GAAP other income and expense yielded a net expense of $97 million as benefits from net currency gains and other income partially offset other expenses. We delivered non-GAAP operating income growth of 14% year on year to $4 billion or 12.4% of revenue including a 80 basis points positive net impact from real estate.  Excluding these gains, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 40 basis points as gross margin expansion more than offset the incremental investment in sales coverage and R&D. First quarter non-GAAP net income improved year over year to $3 billion and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $1.36. In the first quarter HP continued to execute our vision for the next generation data center including all aspects of the converged infrastructure from storage, servers, and networking to software and services. The Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking business grew 22% to $5.6 billion with balanced gross across every region.  Operating profit for the business was up 36% to $828 million for the quarter.  With operating margin of 14.7%, an increase of 150 basis points from the prior year, demonstrating the operating leverage in the business model. Our industry standard servers remained number one in share across all three regions with revenue growth of 17% and ESS delayed revenue increased 23% year over year. Revenue in Business Critical Systems was flat year over year.  The Superdome 2 systems are resonating well with customers with strong growth in the Americas, offsetting uneven performance in the other geographies. We continue to make good progress on a program to displace competitive UNIX products in Q1. Storage revenue increased 14% from the prior year led by strong growth in our Scaleout products and Data D Duplication technology.  Integration of 3PAR is ahead of plan and we saw continued interest from both existing and new customers.  We are on a path to leverage HPs broad channel and enterprise sales force to expand 3PAR’s right to market. HP networking grew 183% including the acquisition of 3Com.  With over 30% growth in our routing and switching business, the proof-of-concept programs is yielding results.  We added more than 40 new accounts including DreamWorks and SHI. Services delivered revenue of $8.6 billion down 2% from the prior year quarter and down 1% excluding the impact of divestiture of the ExcellerateHRO.  Services segment operating profit in the quarter was $1.4 billion or 16% of revenue, up 30 basis points from the prior year driven by continued transformation of our server delivery. IT outsourcing revenue was down 1% year over year, and flat in constant currency.  The business had good long-term contract signings.  This business continues to generate solid revenue streams driving healthy product pull-through and profitability. Application services was down 3% year over year as we didn’t get the short-term project work needed to produce the revenue growth we were expecting.  We are redoubling our focus and have added new leadership to the team.  In addition, we are strengthening both our solutions offerings and our sales coverage to improve performance in this business. Technology services revenue declined 1% and business process outsourcing revenue was down 10% or down 2% excluding the impact of the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.  As Leo outlined, our services business had a mixed overall performance in Q1 and we are taking actions that we expect to have a positive impact in the coming quarter. HP software revenue of $697 million was up 5% compared with the prior year led by 9% services growth, license and support revenue increased 3% and 5% respectively. First quarter operating margin was $123 million or 17.6% of revenue.  We are pleased with the performance of our security portfolio including the acquisitions of Fortified and ArcSight. Turning to personal systems.  PSC delivered revenue of $10.4 billion down 1% from the prior year and flat in constant currency as softness in the consumer markets and our challenges in China offset our strength in commercial markets.  Desktop revenue grew 1% while total notebook revenue was down 5% year over year. The commercial refresh continues.  Commercial client revenue grew 11% led by another strong quarter and work station which generated 43% revenue growth.  We maintained our market leadership in commercial PC’s and continue to expand share in the U.S. Enterprise segment by focusing on winning new accounts from competitors and expanding our channel programs. Consumer client revenue was down 12%.  The consumer softness was predominantly in netbooks, consumer desktop in the U.S. and notebooks in China.  In China we saw good progress in our plan to restore growth, driving 25% sequential revenue growth in that market.  In addition, we exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new product in the channel. Segment operating profit total a record $672 million or 6.4% of revenue, up 140 basis points year-over-year as TSG benefited from favorable component pricing and a more favorable product mix. Moving on to Palm, which is included in corporate investments.  I hope you saw the WebOS event on February 9, where we announced the touchpad and two new Smartphones, the Pre 3 and the Veer.  We’ve been working with the developer community to build up the application ecosystem and are pleased with the progress so far.  WebOS provides a differentiated platform that over time will redefined the user experience across HP device solutions from consumer to enterprise, and from Smartphones to tablets to other devices. The imaging and printing business delivered strong performance in the first quarter with revenue growth of 7% to $6.6 billion led by commercial revenue growth of 13% and supplies growth of 7%. Segment operating profit totaled $1.1 billion or 17% of revenue.  Total printer unit shipments increased 13% with commercial and consumer printer units up 33 and 7% respectively as we gained market share across all printing categories with particular strength in higher usage segments. We continued to see solid momentum in our growth initiative and to lead the market with innovative new products.  Our graphic arts business grew double-digits and we are pleased with momentum in our web press business.  Our color laser and multi-function printer units grew 20% and 63% respectively while business inkjet unit shipments increased double-digits from the prior year and shipments of wireless printer units more than doubled. In addition, we shipped more than 3 million web-connected printers in the quarter.  We will continue to target these markets aggressively, leveraging our technology leadership to drive this shift from analog to digital printing. HP Financial Services continues to deliver strong consistent results.  In the first quarter, financing revenue grew 15% to $827 million.  Financing volume increased 10% and net portfolio assets increased 14%.  Operating profit of $79 million compares to $67 million in the prior year period. Now on to the balance sheet and cash flow.  Our balance sheet remains strong.  We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10 billion.  Our first quarter cash conversion cycle was 21 days compared with 16 days a year ago due to the linearity in the quarter.  In Q1, day sales outstanding increased four days, inventories were flat, and days payable decreased one day. Channel inventories in each business ended the quarter within acceptable ranges.  We generated operating cash flow of $3.1 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion.  During the quarter, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through both share repurchases and dividends.  At the end of the quarter we had roughly $8.6 billion remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. And now a few comments on our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year.  Given the consumer environment we saw in Q1 and the slower growth in our services business, we are revising our full-year outlook and we now expect revenue of 130 to $131.5 billion. For Q2, we expect revenue to be 31.4 to $31.6 billion.  Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep in mind.  We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and we expect OI&E expense of approximately $600 million for the fiscal year, a tax rate of 22%, and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding than we had from Q4 to Q1. We expect weighted average shares outstanding for Fiscal ‘11 to be 2.1 billion shares.  Thus, we expect second quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.21. For the full year, we are raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook.  We now expect non-GAAP EPS to be $5.20 to $5.28 representing growth of approximately 14 to 15% for the fiscal year. With that, we will now open the call for your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions).  And your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.  You may proceed.
Ben Reitzes: Yeah, I’d like to understand the services shortfall a lot more.  The restatement kind of makes it a little murky, but versus my prior estimates, it looks like 6 or $700 revenue lighter in service than expected.  And you mentioned application services but it looks like it’s more on the outsourcing side.  So if you can discuss in more detail what the shortfall is in services and what exactly are you doing about it to get that growth rate up, I’d appreciate it.  Thanks.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Ben.  So services that we mentioned did have a mixed overall performance this quarter.  It had solid long-term findings.  It obviously had good margin expansion and we drove pull through, product pull through in the double digits. The long-term signings have been primarily in the ITO space.  And frankly, over the last few quarters it’s been a nice mix of both new logos but also renewals.  In Q1 as an example, we find a record number of mega deals.  Those are deals that are greater than $100 million in TCV and more than half of them were new logos, so we’re making progress there.  These solid long-term signings are helping us to build what I would consider a foundation of solid annuity-based revenue.  But the softness came in our short-term signings.  And the short-term signings really are in the space of both ITO as well as application services because there are short-term deals in ITO.  We call that add-on work. Also in services, I think you need to take a look at technology services because as reported, technology services declined 1%.  We made a decision about a year ago to stop selling some low-margin third-party hardware and that is generating good business – it’s a good business decision for us, but it’s generating a headwind of about 3 points of growth in the technology services space.  So that means that technology services, instead of really declining 1% on what I would call a go-forward basis, is actually up 2 points. In constant currency, our services business was basically flat year over year when you adjust for the third-party revenue headwind and the divestiture of ExcellerateHRO.  That doesn’t mean that we don’t think that there is an opportunity to improve in the short-term space.
Leo Apotheker: So then let me maybe address the question of what are we going to do about it.  As Cathie has already outlined, we need to do a much better job in our higher value-added services, services that we deliver to our customers.  And what is apparent in Q1 is that we have some work to do.  We need to do a better job in selling short-term value-addrf projects into our installed base.  And actually offer add new customer orders. And we have taken some very specific actions.  We are doubling our senior management focus on this business.  And we have added new leadership to the team.  We have continued to invest in our capabilities to sell and deliver long-term and short-term deals.  We will continue to improve our internal processes so that we can drive our service delivery transformations. We’ll continue to emphasize new types of higher value services like some of the cloud services that you recently announced.  For example, we announced our development works in Q1 and those have already generated more than $250 million of pipeline.
Cathie Lesjak: And maybe one of those pieces of information that everybody would be interested in is basically that with the actions that Leo’s outlined, we do expect to have an improving position in services.  For the year, we now expect services to grow low-single digits.  And we expect the growth to ramp over the course of the year.
Steve Fieler: The next question, Operator.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of JP Morgan.  You may proceed.
Mark Moskowitz: Yes, thank you, good afternoon.  I wanted to follow up here first, should we think about the need to redouble senior management in services as an isolated event?  I think a lot of investors are going to be wondering if there’s a spillover elsewhere in the business.  And then my question is more for you, Cathie.  As far as the outlook, can we understand more about the puts and takes to the operating margin profile for the second quarter, please?
Leo Apotheker: Let me maybe answer the first part of your question, Mark.  What we intend to do is to continue to drive our portfolio services of short-term value-added services into the market.  That is part of the transformation that we are undertaking in the Enterprise Services business that HP had already taken before.  We need to continue to drive this.  And therefore, you’ll see us paying a lot of attention to this asset.
Cathie Lesjak: Mark, let me take your question in kind of two pieces, in gross margins and in OpEx. So from a gross margin’s perspective, we did benefit this quarter from a benign commodity-pricing environment.  We also benefited from an improving business mix as well largely due to network.  Less largely due to PSG as well, but we don’t expect the component prices to continue to be a benefit for us, or as big a benefit in Q2.  And so what we’re calling for basically from a gross margin sequential perspective is that it will be a little less uptick from Q1 to Q2 than what we have seen historically.  So that’s gross margins. In terms of OpEx, you absolutely have to adjust the OpEx trend for the net real estate gains that are in OpEx.  So our OpEx or Admin is actually understated by roughly $250 million of net real estate gains in Q1.  If you take that out of the equation, we expect OpEx will increase sequentially from Q1 to Q2 due to normal seasonality and the salary increases that we talked about in the last quarter.  Obviously, all of this, both the gross margins as well as the OpEx increase from Q1 to Q2 is completely factored into our guidance for Q2.
Steve Fieler: Next question please.
Operator: Next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner of Citigroup.  You may proceed.
Richard Gardner: Thank you.  Cathie, I was just hoping you could give us a sense of what the real estate gain was versus your expectations in the quarter.  You had guided non-GAAP EPS to $1.28 to $1.30.  Was the $250 million what you expected there?  And do you expect any of that to recur going into Q2?
Cathie Lesjak: Richard, unfortunately it’s a bit more complication than that.  So what we talked about last quarter was roughly a $0.04 gain from one-time items principally related to real estate.  The way the accounting actually worked is that it had to be split across two different lines in the P&L.  So there’s roughly a $250 million benefit in Admin obviously above operating profit.  And then there’s roughly an $80 million headwind, or additional charge in OI&E for a net gain of roughly $0.05.  As I mentioned, we thought originally that it would – it rounded to $0.05.  It was going to be roughly $0.04 when we talked the end of last quarter.
Steve Fieler: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.  You may proceed.
Katy Huberty: Thanks, good afternoon.  Cathie, of the 2 billion reduction in full year revenue, how much is PC related?  And then as a follow-up, what inning do you think we’re in in the commercial PC refresh and if we were to see a deceleration in the commercial PC market like we have in consumer, what would be the company’s strategy as it relates to adjusting the cost models so that weren’t to derail the earnings story, or the multiple investors are willing to pay?
Cathie Lesjak: Katy, in terms of our revenue guidance, both for Q2 and the full year, we do remain cautious about the environment for consumer spending specifically around PCs.  So we factored that cautiousness into our outlook as well as the fact that the HP services will grow in Q1 to Q2 below historical seasonality, and then start to improve there on.  But there would still be an overall full year impact as a result of the short-term signings softness that we saw.  And I think it’s important when you think about our guidance whether it’s the top line or the bottom line that we remind you that we plan conservatively, but we always execute aggressively.
Leo Apotheker: Let me maybe address the issue of which innings we are in when it comes to commercial PCs.  We actually see a rather dynamic market.  I would well say that we are in the mid innings to use the American expression.  And we see a good amount for our commercial PCs across all of the regions, all of the [inaudible].  In particular, it’s driven by what we do on the desktop on the work stations, but we also start to see some good recovery across the board for other products.  So mid innings and these markets too have some legs to go.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tony Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein.  You may proceed.
Tony Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you.  I was wondering if you could first comment about China.  It sounded like China was down pretty materially.  You’re the only company that I know of whose Asia growth rate was slower than its overall company growth rate.  Can you explain the dynamics and also specifically what was your year-over-year change in PC revenues in China in the quarter?  And then I have a follow-up please.
Leo Apotheker: Let me address the specific issues in China.  By the way, we have already talked about this issues in China in previous calls as well. We have a particular PC issue in China, which was caused by some events that occurred about a year ago.  Actually, we are progressing in China.  Our desktop and work station business is solid in this country.  And I believe that we are getting past the issues in China.  And we actually saw some good progress in our plan to restore growth, which was up 25% sequentially. We exited the quarter with a healthy mix of new products in the channel.  We are not yet where we want to be, but we are cautiously optimistic about the actions we have been taking in China. It’s a big market.  It’s a very important market.  And we are very much focused in getting it right.  We have had a series of product refreshers particularly in G series.  And that will help our effort for both our channel partners in China.
Tony Sacconaghi: If I could ask a follow-up, and Cathie, maybe you could fill in the blanks on the numbers.  Specifically, what was China’s overall year-over-year growth rate?  And what was China’s PC revenue year over year in Q4? And my separate question is, you missed your own revenue guidance for Q1.  You’re guiding sequentially for the lowest guidance in nine years other than in 2009, which was the downturn for Q2 in terms of sequential change.  So it sounds like you’re expecting things to actually get worse in Q2.  And then when I looked at the back half of the year, you’re actually guiding above normal seasonality for the mid-point of your range, so a pretty dramatic snapback.  It feels like giving the majority of your services revenues is outsourcing and driven by long-term contracts, a turn in services of that magnitude doesn’t appear to explain all of it, so maybe you can help me with that.
Cathie Lesjak: So Tony, in terms of the guidance, there is no question that we are being prudent.  And we’re remaining cautious about the environment for consumer PCs.  I mentioned that earlier. In terms of the second half of the year, the reason why you see better-than-normal seasonality half-over-half is that we do expect to continue to recover in PSG especially in China.  We also expect improvement in the short-term signings based on the actions that we’re taking in the services space. And finally, in the second half of the year, we’ll also benefit from the launch of our new webOS family of products.  And so I think that kind of shows what happens in the second half. In terms of your services comment, one thing that I think is important to understand is that when you sign long-term ITO deals, there’s a period of time where there’s what’s called transition in transformation.  And that period of time is usually the first 12 to 18 months of a contract.  And during that time, you do not recognize all of the revenue.  In fact, a large chunk of the revenue is in fact deferred until the project gets into operation.  And then it is amortized over the remaining licensing deals.  So again, long-term signings are great in terms of building the base.  But when you’re in that period of time where you’re building the base, there isn’t significant growth.
Leo Apotheker: Let me maybe add one comment to what Cathie has said. We have been looking very hard at our focus.  And I can just confirm that we are very confident in our ability to deliver the updated 2011 outlook.  It’s beyond the point that Cathie has already made.  We see strength in our other businesses.  And we have structured numbers going out, and we believe that these are the right numbers.
Steve Fieler: Operator, we’ll go to the next question.  Just as a reminder, we’ll ask each of you to keep to one question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.  You may proceed.
Shannon Cross: Thank you very much.  Leo, could you provide your thoughts on the potential for acquisitions during 2011?  And your thoughts on sort of acquisitions vis-via HP strategy.  And then, if you can just be specific as to whether or not there are acquisitions factored into the revenue growth that was given.  Thank you.
Leo Apotheker: Let me maybe give you a holistic picture on our imminent strategy.  And in fact, I’m going to have to disappoint you because our approach to M&A hasn’t really changed. Across HP’s portfolio, we will continue to pursue growth.  And we’re continue to pursue growth either through organic innovations, or we’ll continue to partner, or we’re continue to evaluate M&A opportunities to make strategic, operational and financial standing.  Only those who actually fit this equation will enter into our imminent equation.  So no real change when it comes to our imminent strategy, but we have some opportunities.  And we’re looking at them.
Cathie Lesjak: And Shannon, there are – the only acquisitions that are included in our outlook are the ones that have already closed.  There are no new acquisitions included in the outlook.
Shannon Cross: And is that a change from prior, or has that been always how you’ve guided on revenue?
Cathie Lesjak: That’s always how we’ve guided on revenue.
Shannon Cross: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.  You may proceed.
Keith Bachman: Cathie, I wanted to ask you a question if I could.  70 days ago, you guys provided guidance.  Now it’s down $2 billion over the course of when you provided guidance at the end of the quarter I should say.  Is it all in those two areas that you mentioned of services and PCs where that $2 billion delta is coming up from?  And then if you could just provide a little bit of color as part of that on what your visibility is on the services side because my understanding is, when you enter the quarter, you have a high degree of 90% plus of visibility at least for the one quarter out periods.  So I’m surprised to hear some of the outlook difference comes from the services side.  Thank you.
Leo Apotheker: Let’s be very clear about this.  What happened in the revenues in Q1 is exactly what we have just described.  In fact, we executed well in many of our other businesses like ESSN and IPG.  So it actually all came from these two isolated events we just talked about, which is services and the consumer PC business. In services, let’s make absolutely sure that we understand that there are at least two different drivers here.  One is the outsourcing business, which is a long-term business.  And Cathie has described already all of the mechanics of that business.  And then there is the variable, which is the short-term value-added business, which can actually fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. In Q1, we had a number of significant issues that we had to address.  We have addressed them.  Our portfolio is much stronger going forward.  And with the focus that we’re going to put on value-added services, I feel confident that quarter after quarter, we’ll be able to pick up the pace and actually meet the guidance again.
Cathie Lesjak: And let me just add one other thing.  In the ITO space, even within ITO, there’s are long-term contracts and long-term signings, and there are short-term ones as well.  And that’s really the project work that goes on within the ITO accounts.  And the short-term signings both from an application services, value-added services, and this add-on business in ITO accounts, that was softer than what we had anticipated at the end of last quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James.  You may proceed.
Brian Alexander: Thank you.  Back at the analyst meeting last September, you indicated you expected 3Com to contributed about three points of growth in 2011, which is just under $600 million.  Based on the numbers you reported, it seems like you should do much better than that.  So I was just wondering if you could update us on your progress and expectations for both of these acquisitions, and specifically where you’re finding success. And related to that, if I back into the networking margins, it looks like you’re in the mid 20%.  That would be operating margins.  And I was wondering if you could comment on the sustainability of those margins in the context of perhaps getting more aggressive on pricing.  Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: I think the comment that I’d make around the acquisitions is that we are 3Com, 3Par, ArcSight, Fortify, the recent acquisitions are all ahead of plan and doing well.  So I think that’s the answer I’d give you to the first one. In terms of the sustainability of the networking margins, we’re not calling for a significant change in those networking margins.  Business has been very strong.  We have increased the number of principle concepts that we’re doing under our proof of concept programs.  Growth is accelerating.  The networking business is strong.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Maynard Um of UBS.  You may proceed.
Maynard Um: Hi, can you just talk a little bit, I know in certain of your segments, you actually saw a good strength in your server and other businesses, but can you talk about the competitive environment obviously of new entrants like CISCO and Oracle in the space?  What are you seeing?  Are they having any impact to either pipelines or pricing?  Any further clarity there would be great. Thank you.
Leo Apotheker: Let me try to give you a little bit of a perspective broken down by each of these various product lines. On the service side, we’ve now had five quarters of formula growth.  We have another 17% year over year in Q1 on the ISS, industries standard service side.  We had a number one in all three regions in X86 servers.  We gained market share year over year.  So that’s performing really well. We have a very strong competitor position with our new product G6’s and G7’s.  And we believe that we can maintain a very strong competitive position going forward. This is also by the way driven by some of IP that we put on top of these things, such as latest metrics that actually help us differentiate our product significantly. When it comes to [inaudible] and to the storage business, we are doing a great job.  Cathie already indicated that that integration is going really well.  We are focused on the next gen data center.  Storage is a key part of that.  And our future technology is a great compliment to our strategy and helps us differentiate from our competition there as well. And just to give you an additional color on the networking business, the 3Com integration has been a huge success.  We are ahead of plan on our three quarters.  And it’s a very quickly growing business for us, and we’ll continue to see very good traction.
Cathie Lesjak: And actually, let me just throw out the numbers.  I guess I am the finance person. In terms of the Enterprise switching and routing business for us on an apple-to-apple basis, that was up more than 30% for HP this quarter.  So it’s a good proof point that networking is in fact contributing to the growth, and to the gross margin profile of the company.
Steve Fieler: Next question please.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Kaushik Roy of Wedbush.  You may proceed.
Kaushik Roy: Thank you.  In the past, you have mentioned that your R&D in sales and marketing will grow faster than revenues.  Does that still hold for Fiscal 2011?
Cathie Lesjak: It does, and our guidance doesn’t call for any pull back in OpEx.  So I think that we’re continuing to move forward with the sales expansion that we’re doing.  The sales expansion in Q1 showed up mostly in Enterprise services storage networking and software.  Those were the biggest areas where we expanded our sales footprint.  And we are continuing to expand R&D through the course of the year as well.
Leo Apotheker: Let me maybe add to that.  We’ll be keeping a very watchful eye on these things.  And we’re watching on the return we get from these OpEx investments.  And we’ll keep on driving a very moderated approach to these expenses depending on our performance.
Steve Fieler: Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers Stifel Nicolaus.  You may proceed.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks guys, and apologize.  I want to go back to actually Keith’s question earlier.  So just to be clear, Cathie, you talked about low single digit growth now in the services business.  I think at the analyst day, you talked about 2% to 4%.  You know if I do the backwards math, that would be about $700, $750 million in revenue shortfall.  That leaves you about a billion left kind of spread across the segments.  I guess my question is, are you still confirming your 7% to 9% growth expectation in Enterprise service storage and networking as well as the 3% to 4% growth target for the imagining an printing segment for fiscal 2011?  Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: Well Aaron, on earnings calls, we don’t typically update our guidance relative to segments, to the segments.  I’ve laid out for you, or we’ve laid out for you, the guidance for Q2 and the full fiscal year from a revenue perspective.  And I don’ t have anything more to add to that.
Leo Apotheker: Let me just wrap this call up by sharing with you some final thoughts. HP delivered strong margins, earnings, and cash flow performance in the quarter.  And our operation discipline is intact.  We continue to show strength in our core markets.  We’re winning in the data center.  We’re capturing the share of [inaudible] pages moving to analog to digital.  And we’re well positioned as word of cloud and connectivity converge. As we discussed, we have some work to do in a couple of areas.  And I’m confident in our ability to execute our plan.  I look forward to sharing more of our strategy with you at our March 14th summit.  Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call for today.  Thank you.

Mark Hurd: Thanks Jim, we in the room are always motivated with Jim's opening, so got to pass that to you, good afternoon and thanks for joining us. HP delivered a strong first quarter. We had balanced growth and profitability across all regions and gained share in key market segments. Our performance continues to be driven by three important factors, significant cost savings to both fund our growth and expand our earnings. Two, our deployment of additional sales resources to capture incremental opportunities in the enterprise and mid-markets, and three diverse global customer base and a broad portfolio that's aligned with the growth areas of the market. Let me be clear, our cost savings are significant and ongoing. Now let me walk you through some highlights for the quarter. Revenue was up 13% to $28.5 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.86 and that's up 32% versus the prior year period. HP generated $3.2 billion of cash from operations, which includes the payment of considerable annual employee bonus commensurate with our strong 2007 performance and we returned $3.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, we announced our intent to acquire Extreme Software, a leader in variable data publishing solutions. Next, I will give you a few of my thoughts on the state of the business and then Cathie will review the numbers. PSG continued to generate strong results by expense discipline and our investment in blade solutions, management software and data center services. PSG grew revenue 10% and expanded operating margin 2.5 points versus the prior year period. I am pleased with our improved performance in this business and content that we can execute against the significant opportunities that remain. The Imaging and Printing Group delivered revenue of 4% and operating margins of 15.7% in the quarter. IPG results show strong execution in our core ink and laser business and solid growth in both the Graphic Cards and the Enterprise. PSG produced another excellent quarter, growing revenue by 24% and expanding operating profit 52%. Our commercial business delivered strong revenue and margin performance, augmenting our strength in consumer, notebooks and emerging geographies. According to the fourth quarter industry data, emerging geographies accounted for nearly half of the PC units shipped in the market and over 60% of the growth. Our results reflect this trend and we are expanding our presence in these developing economies. Now I'll turn it over for a little more depth on the numbers.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon everyone. Before I get into the numbers, I just want to briefly touch upon our financial reporting item. Each year as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we review our reported segments and make changes between these segments to reflect any organizational shifts between the businesses. As indicated in our Q4 call, beginning in FY '08 the Business Intelligence and Information Management businesses have moved into HP Software from ESS and Services. As a result of this change, the revenue and operating profit and loss associated with these businesses have been moved from ESS and Services into HP Software. I'll discuss the impact to HP software P&L more fully in a few minutes when I talk about the segment results. Additionally, there are changes in PSG and IPG, but with no net change at the segment level. Our detailed bridge of these changes, including historical data, is available on our investor relations website, as well as furnished on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. I want to be very clear that the changes do not impact HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS. This should just be viewed as an annual fine tuning of our financial reporting structure to better align it with how we manage the business. Now moving on to the results of the quarter, HP began fiscal 2008 with solid performance and balanced operating profit growth. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $28.5 billion up 13% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating profit grew 31% to $2.8 billion or 9.9% of revenue. Looking at revenue by geography, Asia-Pacific grew 22%, EMEA was up 15% and Americas increased 8%. We generated 69% of total revenue outside of the US, with emerging markets driving significant growth. First quarter gross margins were 24.5% compared to a year ago gross margin was up 80 basis points, driven by a generally favorable commodity environment, disciplined pricing and improvements in warranty and attach. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.1 billion or 14.6% of revenues, down from 15.1% a year ago. Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 6%, as we added sales and go-to-market resources and absorbed acquisitions. We will continue to align our cost structure for greater efficiency and growth. Non-GAAP OI&E yielded income of $72 million or roughly $0.02 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21% in Q1. First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.86 up 32% from the $0.65 that we reported one year ago. GAAP EPS was $0.80, which included $158 million or $0.06 per share in after-tax adjustments, primarily related to the amortization of purchased intangibles that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Now drilling in on the performance by business segments, during the first quarter, Imaging and Printing had revenue of $7.3 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Excluding cameras, revenue was up 5%. Supplies revenue grew 6% and Commercial hardware revenue grew 7%, while Consumer hardware revenue declined 5% year-over-year. Segment operating profit was $1.2 billion or 15.7% of revenue, reflecting gross margin expansion and favorable product mix. We continue to see solid momentum in our growth initiatives. Our Graphic Arts business grew in double-digits and color laser and multi-function printer units grew 14% and 23% respectively. Commercial hardware units increased 13% and consumer hardware units declined 2%. We continue to focus on targeting unit growth in areas of high supplies consumption. But do believe that we had more unit opportunities than we realized in Q1. Going forward, we expect to at least maintain shares in the mature inkjet markets and see additional opportunities for growth in targeted areas, such as Graphic Arts and Enterprise Printing. Within IPG we are also focused on reducing the cost structure and have a number of ongoing initiatives to improve supply chain efficiency and lower product cost. At the same time, we will continue to invest for growth and profitability through our commitment to research and development, targeted share gains, growth in Graphic Arts and expansion of our Enterprise Printing sales force. Personal Systems had another outstanding quarter with market share gains and strong margin performance revenue grew 24% year-over-year, or $2 billion with unit shipments up 27%. We had a strong holiday season with consumer client revenue up 29%, consumer notebook sold particularly well, demonstrating our strength, our strong product lineup, targeted marketing and the strength of our retail channels. Commercial client revenue grew 22%, reflecting solid demand in enterprise and mid-market segments. Overall, notebook shipments grew 49%, with strong performance in both Consumer and Commercial. Desktop and workstation units were each up 15%. Segment operating profit for the quarter was $628 million, or 5.8% of revenue. Compared with the prior year period, PSG operating profit increased 52%, or $214 million reflecting solid execution, increased attached and the benefit of a favorable commodity environment. You should expect us to continue to balance revenue growth and profitability by managing our costs, investing in market opportunities and leveraging our strength in notebooks, retail and emerging markets. Moving onto Technology Solutions Group, Enterprise Storage and Servers revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $4.8 billion. Within ESS, Industry Standards Server revenue grew 11% and ESS blades grew 81%. Revenue in storage grew 10%, with the midrange EVA business growing 14% and the [Nearline] business posting 4% growth after many quarters of declining revenue. Business critical systems revenue grew 1% year-over-year, Integrity server revenue grew 37% and now represents 75% of BCS mix. ESS operating margins for the quarter were 3.8 points to 14% of revenue, filled by favorable component pricing, improved execution and expense discipline. While we are pleased with the progress we've made, we can still do a better job penetrating our addressable market. You'll see us take actions to drive go-to-market initiatives and add sales resources to expand account coverage and strengthen our customer relationship. We had a solid quarter in HP services, with revenue up $4.4 billion, up 11% over the prior year period. Outsourcing and consulting and integration revenue increased 15% and 13% respectively, while technology services revenue was up 9%. Operating profit for the quarter was $489 million or 11.2% of revenue. We remained focused on balancing margin expansion with revenue growth. Our services results reflect improved focus on services attach, combined with operational improvements from our ongoing efficiency initiative. We've made progress reducing our cost to service delivery, but we still have considerable work to do. As I discussed earlier, beginning in Q1 we are reporting Business Intelligence and Information Management businesses as part of HP Software. On this basis HP Software revenue was $666 million, up 11% from the prior year. BTO, formally reported as OpenView increased revenue 19% to $548 million and other software, which includes OpenCall, Business Intelligence and Information Management had revenue of $118 million. Q1 operating profit for the segment was $51 million or 7.7% of revenue. For comparative purposes HP software would have reported revenue of $611 million and operating margin of 12.7% of revenue, if we had excluded the impact of business reclassifications, but included the impact of acquisitions. We have included a slide in the presentation that provides historical bridges for the business reclassification. The software business includes the combination nascent and scaled businesses. We are pleased with the progress the BTO organization is making in integrating Opsware and expect to grow this business, as we help customers manage their IT infrastructure. At the same time, we're expanding our Information Management and Business Intelligence businesses by investing in our solution portfolio and go to market presence. Similar to last year, we expect to expand profit margins as the year progresses and are comfortable with the 20% to 22% operating margins for FY '09 that we outlined at our analyst meeting in December. Finally, HP Financial Services had revenue of $642 million, up 17 % year-over-year and generated operating margin of 6.7%. We are encouraged with the growth in our core financing volume and portfolio assets over the last several quarters, as well as the strong performance in end of lease renewals and equipment sales. Moving now to the balance sheet, HP-owned inventory ended Q1 at 33 days of supply, this is down six days compared with a year ago reflecting our focus on improving execution and working capital management. With regards to channel inventory, we ended the quarter with PSG and ESS down roughly half a week year-over-year and IPG flat year-over-year. Days sales outstanding increased to 39 days in Q1 from 37 days one year ago, days payable was 47 days, down from 53 days last year. As we've discussed in prior quarters, we will continue to leverage our balance sheet to drive shareholder value. Next, property, plant and equipment was up $759 million year-over-year and down 20 basis points, as a percentage of revenue. Gross CapEx was $611 million, down 15% year-over-year. On a net basis, CapEx was $523 million, down 10% from the prior year period. Capital expenditures were primarily related to assets used in our leasing business and our investments in IT. Moving on to cash balance and cash flow. Strong operational performance combined with ongoing focus on working capital metrics resulted in Q1 cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion and free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Included in these results was the significant FY '07 annual bonus, which was paid out in the first quarter. In addition, we spent $3.3 billion on share repurchases during the quarter. Relative to prior quarters, the linearity of repurchases in Q1 was backend weighted. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $7.4 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization. Finally, we paid our normal quarterly dividend totaling $206 million. We closed the year with a strong balance sheet including total growth cash of $10.1 billion and net cash of $2.9 billion. Now a few comments on our outlook for both the second quarter and the full fiscal year. We expect Q2 fiscal 2008 revenues to be approximately $27.7 billion to $27.9 billion. Similar to last quarter and in light of the increasingly tough compares in PSG, we do not believe it is prudent to set investor expectations that our personal systems business can continue to grow at this pace, nor do we think it appropriate to build the cost structure on that basis. Given our significant international exposure, our results may be favorably or unfavorably impacted by currency. Assuming exchange rates stay roughly where they are and given our assumptions about hedging and pricing we expect full year revenue will be approximately $113.5 billion to $114 billion. Regarding earnings there are few variables to keep in mind. First we expect the component pricing environment to be less favorable in Q2 than it was in Q1. Second we estimate non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.01 per share in Q2 and approximately $0.07 for the full year 2008. Finally we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters, however likely at a lower rate than in Q1. Share count will be impacted by the share price trends, option exercise patterns, common stock equivalents and repurchase activity. Currently, we expect the somewhat steeper decline in Q2 and a more modest decline in weighted average shares outstanding in the second half of the year. With that in mind we expect Q2 '08 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.83 to $0.84. For the full year we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.50 to $3.54, representing growth of 19% to 21% on revenue growth of about 9%. So, all in all we delivered solid results in Q1 and increased our outlook for the year, reflecting the strength of our business model and our progress today. Before we go to Q&A I'll now turn it back over to Mark for a few additional comments.
Mark Hurd: Thanks Cathie. Well I realized that macro economic uncertainties exist, its important to note that we control many of the levers that drive our performance. We are therefore confident in our ability to neatly expand our earnings per share. We expect to remove significantly more cost this year than we did last year. We will take this savings and realign our cost structure to fund investments that both improved the efficiency of HP and create growth opportunities. Combined with our strong balance sheet, broad geographic reach and considerable recurring revenues, these factors allow us to constantly raise our EPS guidance. With that Cathie and I will now take your questions.
Jim Burns: Okay. Let's take the first question, operator.
Operator: Our first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with UBS. Go ahead.
Ben Reitzes - UBS: Yeah. Good afternoon, and good quarter. I wanted to just talk a little bit about the macro economic environment. I mean, going into the quarter, there was a lot of speculation about things having slowed in January, et cetera, and your guidance is obviously indicating that. And I am just wondering if you can confirm any linearity in the quarter? And also just talk, perhaps, a little bit more about how you control your own destiny? Maybe acknowledge share gains, or something that gives you confidence, or a little more that gives you confidence on the raising guidance, given the economic backdrop?
Mark Hurd:  I will start, Ben. Thanks for the question, and thanks for your comments. I think we saw a pretty good linearity at the HP level during the quarter, and there was no story in terms of one month being better than the others, so it was pretty smooth. I'll try to give you a little bit more color. Obviously, we have a good position from a geographic deployment perspective. So, when you look across our segments and our businesses, we really had solid growth across all businesses and regions. Again, 69% of our revenue was outside the United States, so again I think that's probably an asset. And again, in the U.S., Ben, I am giving you a little more color than your question, but I'll try to give you a little bit more insight. We've got multiple stories to go on, remembering it's only 31% of our revenue. I say only, but relative to what you see in some tech peers, we have an enterprise business, but frankly we're putting more go-to-market resources in, and there is an effect to a degree of that investment in growth. And frankly, we are putting more effort into the US than we have in the past. So, I'm not sure we're the best person to compare specifically year-over-year comps, because of the effort we are putting in to improve our position. So, I would tell you in the US, at the end of the quarter, we saw a little bit more caution in the consumer segment than what we've seen in the past. But again, I tell you that in the context of the big picture on a global basis, we saw pretty steady growth across all of our businesses and segments. And Ben, clearly there are stories within the story. On the EPS raise of guidance for us, part of it, frankly, the fact is the good news is we have lot of work to go do. The bad news is we have a lot work to go do, and we just got to get after getting it done. I think as we outlined in the Security Analyst meeting, we've done a lot of work on corporate overhead. We have a lot of work to do on some of our business unit owned processes, where a lot of our cost is, and as you've heard us say before, we're dead serious about getting this right, and we think getting this right puts us in a very strong position to go after the market and compete. And I can't comment on share gains, because I just don't know all of data yet, I only know frankly ours.
Ben Reitzes - UBS: Okay. Thanks a lot, Mark.
Cathie Lesjak: The only thing I would add to that, Ben, is just that, we have built capacity in our plans for fiscal '08, so that we can adjust if the demand isn't there that we are expecting. And we really have a good line to follow-up on some of Mark's comments, a good line of sight on our cost cuts. That combined with the investments that we have made to, frankly, improve our position in accounts, in terms of the share of wallet, and our recurring revenue, it gives us a lot of confidence in our EPS guidance.
Ben Reitzes - UBS: Thank you very much guys.
Jim Burns: Thanks, Ben. Let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line Richard Gardner with Citigroup, go ahead.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup: Okay. Thank you very much. Mark and Cathie, the thing that struck me from a product perspective this quarter was that supplies revenue growth actually accelerated, despite the fact you had a tougher year-over-year compare, and it looked like you were actually a little bit better than seasonal norms for the quarter. And I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color around what's driving the strength in supplies revenue growth, and whether it was toner or ink, et cetera?
Mark Hurd: I know no meaningful difference between toner and ink trends Richard in the quarter. Again, we have the benefit of a large install base. I mean, during the quarter we shipped our 500 millionth printer. And so, when you look at this, the pure scale of the business and the size of the install base it's a big one and as you know we've invested from a unit perspective into that base for a while. Now, let me give you some further color, when you look at camera and you look at the appliances and we were very cautious, as we mentioned in our previous call, about appliance placements. I am giving you a full year characterization here, Richard, roughly two to three points, I would say, growth headwind. And I want to say one more time growth headwind for IPG in rationalizing those two categories through the portfolio. So, again, I would ask you, Richard, to take IPG in the context. There are pretty radical transformation we're doing inside IPG. We're working on a lot of cost that we're trying to take out of the business. We're investing in growth markets that are giving us subsequent growth that, Cathie's point, that she mentioned Graphics and the Enterprise, performed very nicely from a growth perspective for us in the quarter. So, we're taking money and investing in those categories and it is showing up. At the same time, as we have a core business, we're sort of picking our spots, as to where we feel makes sense to work on. Now, as Cathie also mentioned, and I'll follow-up on that, that we had some inkjet placements in the quarter that we could have [made then] from a unit perspective. So, we had some tailwind, some headwind because of the appliances, but we could have done better than we did, and just to be very blunt, I am not real happy about it. So, there is more work for us to yet go do.
Richard Gardner - Citigroup: Great, thanks Rich. So let's take a next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line David Bailey with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, thank you, just sort of follow-up on that. Your overall printer unit growth has come down four quarters in a row, and given the weakness that we see in inkjet demand across the industry, should we think this is a trend that should continue? Or are there some reasons that you should start to see some stabilization or rebounding growth, as we go through the year?
Mark Hurd: I will make couple of comments and Cathie can follow-up. I sort of tried to give you that, even actually in Richard's question; I mean we reported 1% unit growth. There is couple of points in unit growth tied up in the appliance piece. Remember, that the laser growth in the quarter was 13%, so very significant double-digit laser growth. So, when you think a couple of points on the inkjet side, our total units would have come back through the appliance side, plus we left a couple of points on the table that we thought we could have. So, you really got two different tails here David. You’ve got laser business that's 13% growth, that's going pretty quick. You’ve got the inkjet business that has some of the characteristics you described. I would, at the risk of giving you one more twist, tell you that in the long run we are very focused on pages. So when we talk about inkjet units we sort of lose the context that what happens in SITEX growth and Indigo growth in the high-end commercial printing, frankly, has as much to do with our future. And to Richard's earlier point, we may wind up with a slight disconnect in trying to model unit growth in inkjet to supplies growth, because what happens is, and I won't do this again, but an Indigo printer when it goes out, is worth thousands and thousands of inkjet consumer printers going out. And as those businesses grow, you can start to get a disconnect from what the supplies growth looks like, and what the actual inkjet unit growth looks like. And you are going to hear us talking a lot more about trying to get you some transparency to what that page growth looks like, and the implications it has, long-term, on our supplies business.
David Bailey - Goldman Sachs: Great, thanks David. Let's take the next question please?
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tony Sakanagi with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead.
Tony Sakanagi - Sanford Bernstein: Yes, good afternoon and thank you. Mark and Cathie, you are providing guidance for revenues to be down just over 2% sequentially in the second quarter, and for the last five Q2s, your revenues have actually gone up sequentially in Q2. Given the context for your comments, which seemed very positive, is this good old fashion conservatism? Given the environment, is this something you see coming in the PC marketplace that will cause your PC growth rate to accelerate, which you alluded to, or is there something else that we should think about relative to recent seasonality?
Cathie Lesjak: So Tony, as I mentioned in my script, and we've been saying this now for a number of quarters, we don't think it's a good idea to actually put out a cost structure in place for our PC business and expect it to grow at the same rate it's been growing at. So each of the last few quarters, we have in fact taken our guidance down for the PC side of the house. We also think it's smart from a cost perspective to do that, but other than this, our guidance is frankly very well aligned with the typical seasonality that we see in each of our businesses. Now, the only other thing I would add to this is, as our businesses are growing at different rates, the mix in our seasonality is changing a bit. So, when you look at it at total company level, you do need to adjust for that as well. And we actually see the seasonality from Q1 to Q2 probably closer to flat to maybe up just a snitch.
Tony Sakanagi - Sanford Bernstein: So, Cathie, are you suggesting then, if PCs are third of your business and you're about three points off your seasonal guidance, that implicit in your outlook is about a 10 point deceleration in the PC revenue growth rate? 
Cathie Lesjak: I don't think it's quite that large, but it's certainly directionally correct. The other thing I would add is that if you look at the seasonal pattern Q1 to Q2, you've also got to adjust for currency, right? And on a currency adjusted basis it's more like 0%.
Mark Hurd: And Tony, I just can't help myself with the word deceleration, because we're now comparing it against big, big growth rates in last year. So, when you combine the growth rate in 2007 with what's going on in 2008, I saw somebody writing some sort of note about PSG just a few minutes ago that it decelerated to 24% growth for the year, being this Q1 number that we just reported. So boy, if that's a definition of deceleration, it’s an interesting comments, so.
Tony Sakanagi - Sanford Bernstein: You'll take it any day. Okay.
Mark Hurd: Yeah. And Tony I think, to your point, and we've talked about this before at Security Analysts meeting, its really important for us to not get a business model build on those kind of numbers. And again what we try to do is build capacity, to Cathie's earlier point, into our model. That, if that opportunity is available then, and it make sense for us, we go get it. But the fundamental business model is built on a more conservative platform and we're not trying to go out and necessarily gain share and that's the objective. We are trying to build the great business and if we build the great business, we believe the gain of share and those growth rates are really the result. And so, I don't know if that helps. But again, and I know you've heard this before, but that really is our core focus.
Tony Sakanagi - Sanford Bernstein: Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Cathie.
Jim Burns: Okay. Let's take the next question please, operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with JP. Morgan. Go ahead.
Bill Shope - JP. Morgan: Okay, great, thanks. I was wondering if you can give us some more color on ASP trends specifically in PCs, they were remarkably tamed for you guys, as well as the industry, all of last year? And I am wondering are you expecting that's a whole this year? Have you seen any material changes in pricing patterns, particularly over the holiday season? And if not, how much room do you think you have here to possibly get more aggressive on pricing to obviously gain share, but also to counter some potential macro pressures on units?
Mark Hurd: So, Bill to your point, it was tame in Q4. It was fairly tame again, I would say in Q1. I wouldn't say that we're seeing pricing pressure beyond the norm. I again go back to the comments, that when somebody says did you see a competitive environment, I just don't remember when it wasn't competitive. So, if somebody said the other way, did I see if there is some big change, we did not in the quarter. So, when we go back to your point, to go for more share gains, that's not where we start Bill. We don't start the discussion with let's drive prices as the number one driver in the market. So, it's probably not where we start. Again, we'll look to pick our spots based on market and segments that make sense, but probably not where we go, but to answer your question, probably more of what you heard in Q4 than some sort of change.
Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Thank you, Bill.
Jim Burns: Thanks, Bill. Let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. Go ahead.
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Good, thanks very much. I just wanted to know Mark, you gave us an update on the data center consolidation, there was an article in the Wall Street Journal the other day that quoted you and others talked about how tough it was, just give me a sense of how that's coming together, where you think you are and what the implications are for HP and also with regards to your customers, with this sort of what you've done for your self.
Mark Hurd: All right. Andy, thanks for the question. Yeah, I saw that, and listen our team has done just a superb job. We still have more work to do, and you know as we talked about much of the savings that comes along with it sort of trails, certainly as opposed to lead. But we are a long way through, and it really starts with us with a process change, then an application consolidation and application modernization process, and then that allows us to consolidate infrastructure and therefore close data centers. So it really falls in that flow. We run the company. We started running the company, and we were running the company in early 2005 on roughly 6,000 applications. And Cathie and I looked at this about week ago. We're running the company right now on a little more than 3,000 applications, so we're about halfway through the application consolidation. We're a little further ahead in the infrastructure consolidation and data centers that trail us. So, that's roughly where we are. To your point, we've done a lot of hard work and I think the article, which I think was a representation of us telling customers that this is very important work to go do, and what we are trying to do is show all of the things that we encountered, as we went through the process, so it becomes a learning vehicle for them. So, as a result of trying to teach learnings and to show those, we actually focus on more of the problems that will do the benefit. If I step back for a second and sit from where we started, I think our team has really done well Andy and I think Cathie and I would both -- we are all proud of them.
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns: You talked about getting most of it done during fiscal '08. Are you still comfortable with that?
Mark Hurd: Yeah, we're making a lot of progress. We had a very strong quarter, in terms of IT getting its work done. It's very important to us too, because it's not only the fact that we save money, but we also actually get a simpler infrastructure. So, just to give you an idea of the implication of this, when you consolidate applications, I will give one example, we use to have 75 separate consumer support applications at Hewlett Packard, so we had a separate consumer support application in each country for our consumer PC and consumer printer business. We now consolidated those to one application, one application that now supports our entire consumer support across the company, which means IT can now do one modification to our code base, drop it down one time, whereas before we had to do 75 different modifications to be able to get that done. That not only lowers our cost, but increases our speed. It makes us more nimble, and this gives us a better platform to run the company. So, yes, I think we're on track. We think we feel good about it, we still have work to do and we'll let you know as soon as we're comfortable with the goal line.
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Thanks very much.
Mark Hurd: Thank you.
Cathie Lesjak: And we still fully expect to have a run rate savings for the full year FY'09 of a $1 billion related to IT. And the beauty, frankly, in this model is also that, with that reduced spend you are still getting a much more significant percentage of spend, focused on innovation, than you do on maintenance, because with the simpler application and infrastructure your maintenance costs go down pretty dramatically. And frankly, I can tell you all of our businesses are very excited about getting more innovations.
Mark Hurd: I can't help myself, Andy, rather than to say and the point that goes to customers, that's needed about this is, you're actually playing into the environment that's saying, listen, in a tough environment, here is an opportunity to get to save money at the same time as you get a better platform to go build upon in the future. So, the internal work we're doing is in many ways the basis of our enterprise go-to-market discussion with customers.
Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns: Thank you.
Jim Burns: Okay, thanks Andy, lets take the next question please, Melanie.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Go ahead.
Shannon Cross - Cross Research: Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask you a bit more on the printer side of the business, just Mark, when you think about the trade-offs between margins and market share and units placements in that. Can you give us your idea on where you are going after this year, because obviously with unit volumes slowing, you think you'd have a mix shift to supplies and I think you also mentioned some pretty aggressive cost moves within IPG? So at the end of the day, how aggressive do you think you will be on pricing? How much you can go for to return to the bottom-line for margin expansion etcetera? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: Well, we'll try to be precise in our aggression, if that makes sense, as opposed to just running around, trying to do things that are aggressive in a broader sense. But again, I would like to tell you that IPG is a bit more complicated in the context of thinking them with at least four big things we're trying to do at the same time. One is we're trying to realign our cost structure. And the great thing about IPG is it's a great business that's made a lot of money. The bad thing is it's a great business; it's made a lot of money. And like with many businesses that have done that for a long time, we have certain ways of doing things that VJ and Cathie and I know we can do a lot better than we're doing today. And it forms the basis for a big cost opportunity for us and we are working it. Secondly, we want to grow the Graphics business. Cathie, I thought, was very clear on our intent and our performance in that business. Third, we want to grow our enterprise business, and both of those have performed nicely for us over the past several quarters, again in Q1. Fourth, there is a core consumer business. And we look at that differently by geography, as we described. We look at the laser business a little different than we do the inkjet business. And so, when you look at that entire aggregation, we will pick our spots. And I would tell you here that we are not just trying to drive margin, we're looking at the optimization of long-term margin, which has a balance of units of placement, but making sure there are sensible unit placements that have long-term supplies connect at the same time as we try to get short-term operating profits. So, it is very possible, Shannon, as you know, that we have a profit number and we wish to put more units in the market, and as I mentioned earlier, there were some units we could have put in the market, as we looked back on it afterwards, that we wish we had. And it is what it is. So we'll go back and make sure we try to get this right as we move forward here.
Shannon Cross - Cross Research: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Thank you, Shannon.
Jim Burns: Okay. Thanks, Shannon. Let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Go ahead.
Brian Alexander - Raymond James: Thank you. Mark, you were specific earlier in the call, saying you have reduced more cost this year than last year. Hence the question, are you accelerating any of the actions that you previously announced in light of the macro environment, or has that been the plan coming into the fiscal year? And any change in thinking on reinvestment versus flow through of those savings in light of the environment? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: No. We're really on the same trajectory Brian, I mean I commented earlier, when somebody tells me because of the macro environment are you doing something else, it implies there were some inefficiency we weren't going after anyway. And everything in the company is up for a debate. And so Cathie and I go through this excruciating detail to make sure we've got our cost structure headed in right direction. So, I would just tell you we're very focused on getting it right. And we have opportunities to do it. From a reinvestment back in the scale of our sales organization, we are on trajectory to do it and we're continuing to try to balance the cost take out relative to the investment.
Jim Burns: Okay. Thanks. Brian. And let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley: Yes, thanks. How purposeful was the reduction in inventory in late January ahead of the expectations of potentially slower PC growth? And where there any product segments that you feel inventory was constraint at the end of the quarter?
Cathie Lesjek: So, Katie it wasn't purposeful, other than to say that we've been working on our inventory management since Q1 last year, there has been a real intense focuses in the company on that, and this is just the result of many quarters of hard work. So, I wouldn't read anything more into it other than much better inventory management.
Operator:  Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Cowen And Company. Go ahead.
Louis Miscioscia - Cowen and Company: Okay. Thank you. You had in your press release that you added 2000 more sales people. Could you give us the total number of sales people you have? And I know you have been talking about for quite a while of growing this, do you think you have finally hit the level that you're reasonably happy with. And maybe finally and [sorry] about most of our question, if you could talk about if a lot of this went into the emerging markets? 
Mark Hurd: So we don't release headcount information at that level of detail, but we're obviously more than 2000 sales people, since we added to them, that many. But I would tell you that we are very under covered, and we're very under represented in the market, and it’s an issue for us. We think we have a just superb lineup of products and capabilities. It’s frustrating to us, because we obviously know we come to work everyday, and then under distribute them in the market. And we've got a very strong line up of partners out there. We have 144,000 resellers and partners that help us, but at the end of day, when you go through a detailed market, mapping by market segment, by geography, by product segment, even by industry, where it make sense certainly in the context of the mid-market and the enterprise, we are dramatically under covered. And when I say that, we're not off by 10% or 20%, we're off by more than that. And so, we're trying hard to be fit up. And it’s not direct salespeople, so we give you that number as one fact point, but it really is a combination of partners, sort of badged and full time employed HP people, working in unison to try to get a broader distribution footprint across the entire market. Much of it is in emerging markets, but it's not all in emerging market and as you heard 31% of our revenue in the US and the US is one of the markets that we're not as well distributed as we'd like to be. So it's a broad based issue for us, just as our cost issue is a broad based issue for us. We try hard to work them in alignment. And this is the issue for us, to try to do two things at the same time, and that's where what we are working on. So we have improved the situation, based on the headcount that we described and also relationships investments we've made in the channel. That said, there is more work for us to go.
Mark Hurd: Okay. Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Thank you.
Jim Burns: Okay. Let's take the next question please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Craig with Banc of America. Go ahead.
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Hi, good afternoon. Hey Cathie, can you talk about the component cost environment a little bit? You mentioned that you don't see it as being as favorable going forward. So can it be a little bit more specific? It just seems like every quarter we keep hearing about that, and component pricing doesn't look that bad too us. Actually it looks like it’s gotten a little bit better over the past couple of months. So any flavor there would be appreciated? Thanks.
Cathie Lesjak: In Q1, it was clearly more favorable than we had expected, and you saw that in the margin expansion at the HP Co level, as well as the operating margin expansion at the PSG and Enterprise Server and Storage level. In terms of an outlook, we think that the supply generally looks good. We are starting to see a memory pricing environment that seems to be stabilizing a bit or getting more solid. There could be an uptick there, but we're certainly not seeing the same sort of declines that we've seen in the last couple of quarters. And so, we're basically pricing in, or thinking about the fact that memory will be a bit tougher than it was in last couple of quarters, and factoring that into our guidance.
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Okay. So it's predominantly memory then? The rest you still see as being somewhat favorable then?
Cathie Lesjak: No. I think LCD panels, as well, have started to tick off a bit. And memory is the biggest delta, if you think about it from kind of quarter-to-quarter in Q4 and Q1, but you definitely have seen some firming in prices in LCD panels as well.
Scott Craig - Banc of America: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of [Jason Nolan] with Robert Baird. Go ahead.
Jason Nolan - Robert Baird: Thank you. Question on follow-up earlier to the data center question, are you still seeing demand for tours of your new data centers in Texas, and specifically are Enterprises more likely to undertake a large data center consolidation in this environment?
Mark Hurd: So, first of all, what I think I can actually say is, we have (inaudible) demand for people that want to get into our IT organization and understand what they have done. We try very hard to not do just a one-off event with IT folks. We try to consolidate and make them more formal, and get people more exposure to what we've done in IT, because we have an IT organization that still has work to do for Hewlett Packard. So, yes, we have very strong demand for people to see it and for people to get into our data centers. But frankly, not just get into the data center, but understand strategically what we have done and then how the execution is done. And most of our work is done to create play books that actually talk about the way we approach things, and to be very blunt, I think Andy talked about earlier, the mistakes that we made, where we made them in terms of our approach. In terms of companies, I think there are different companies in different forms of maturation, in terms of the states that they are in, and that has an implication on what they do. But there is no question right now. There is a lot of attention on IT and a lot of attention in terms of the relationship of IT to business benefit. So, we think it's a major opportunity in the market and there is a lot of strategic dialogue, I'll put it that way, about how people think about IT and the approaches they take to rationalizing.
Jason Nolan - Robert Baird: Thanks.
Jim Burns: Okay. Let's take one more question please operator.
Operator: Yes sir. Our next question comes from the line of David Wong with Wachovia, go ahead.
David Wong - Wachovia: Thank you very much. Can you give us the unit growth on your Industry Standard Servers and also the absolute levels of channel inventory, I think you gave us year-over-year, but not the absolute levels of channel inventory?
Mark Hurd: I think unit growth, I just want to make sure, I know the number. Do we give this out? It was very high double-digits, I'll just leave it at that. So high teens, sorry high teens, that's better. But high teens was unit growth, and I'll leave it at that one. We typically don't give the absolute channel inventory numbers. As we give them out, we give them in terms of weeks, and we give them in terms of compares. So, that's where we leave it. ESS inventory, which is what we report, was healthy and very well positioned coming out of Q1 and that was again purposeful on our part to just position ourselves well going into the rest of the year. Okay. Thanks for your questions. I'd like to summarize today's call by saying that HP had a strong quarter. It was characterized by balance growth across all regions, share gains in key businesses, margin expansion, expense discipline, strong cash flow from operations and significant share repurchases. Going forward, I am confident in our ability to deliver strong results, based on the three elements I mentioned to you earlier. Significant cost savings that both fund our growth and expand our earnings, our deployment of additional sales resources to capture incremental opportunities in the Enterprise and mid markets, and third, the diverse global customer base and a broad product portfolio that is inline with the growth areas of the market. Given the solid fundamentals within our business, we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the 10th consecutive quarter. I am pleased with our progress today. We have a lot of work to do. I am confident that we can continue to produce another year of strong financial returns. Thanks again for joining our call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. That does conclude the presentation. You may disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2007 Q4  (2007-11-20 16:00:00) =====

Finally, I would ask that you please refrain from askingmulti-part questions or clarifications during the Q&A. I will now turn thecall over to Mark.
Mark V. Hurd: That request of Jim’s has never worked in any call but Ihope it works today, and with that, good afternoon and thanks for joining us.HP delivered a strong fourth quarter to close out its solid fiscal year. We hadbalanced growth across all regions and executed well in key market segments. For the year, we added over $12 billion of new revenue, grewnon-GAAP operating profit dollars 30%, and returned over $12 billion toshareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Let me walk you through some of the financial highlights ofthe quarter. HP revenue grew 15% to $28.3 billion. Non-GAAP operating marginsexpanded to 9.9% of revenue, which up 90 basis points from last year. Non-GAAPEPS was $0.86, up 26% versus the prior year period and we utilized our strongcash flow to repurchase $2 billion of shares. We generated these results while continuing to invest in ourlong-term strategic initiatives, which we expect will strengthen HP'scompetitiveness and efficiency. We did close 10 acquisitions during the yearand recently announced three more. With MacDermid ColorSpan, we expanded our portfolio ofdigital presses and wide format prints for our growing position in the graphicarts industry. With Atos Origin Middle East, we strengthened our consulting andintegration capabilities in this fast-growing market and by acquiring EYPMission Critical facilities, we’ll further our ability to design and to supportlarge scale data centers. Next I’ll try to spend a few minutes giving you somebusiness highlights and then Cathie will walk you through the actual numbers. We saw meaningful improvement in the TSG group, TechnologySolutions Group, which grew revenue 12% and operating profit 31% versus theprior year quarter. This performance generated $1.4 billion of operating profitrepresenting approximately half the company’s profit for the quarter. HPsoftware, blade servers and technology services all finished the year withespecially strong results. Our solution portfolio is stronger than ever and we areencouraged by the initial results of the enterprise sales force deployment.Building on this success, we will be making additional sales coverageinvestments in 2008 to expand our share of wallet. 2007 marked an important year for HP software. We doubledthe size of the business and strengthened our portfolio with key acquisitions.I am particularly pleased with the success of Mercury and the integration hasgone well. In the fourth quarter, we began to achieve the kind ofoperating margins expected from a scaled software business, one that is now thesixth largest software company in the world. In addition, we recently closedthe acquisition of Opsware, the leading in run-book automation and server andnetwork configuration. Moving forward, we’ll continue to grow the business,reintegrated Opsware, and strategically align our business intelligence andinformation management capabilities under the HP software segment. The personal systems group delivered an impressive fourthquarter to close out an excellent 2007. For the year, revenue grew over $7billion and operating profit increased by $787 million, more than any othersegment at HP. We continue to benefit as demand shifts towards mobility, toconsumer and emerging geographies such as Southeast Asia and Latin America. InChina, we are now selling in over 400 cities with more expansion planned inthis key market. In the fourth quarter, we also closed the acquisition ofNeoware, which will solidify our leadership in the thin client market. The imaging and printing group produced a solid fourthquarter with good momentum in key growth areas, including graphic arts andcommercial printing. For the year, IPG revenue grew 6% and operating marginsexpanded to 15.2%. We saw meaningful growth in our enterprise printing businessthis quarter and will be expanding our sales coverage in this segment. At the same time that we’re investing in our growth markets,we are rationalizing parts of our imaging and printing portfolio. As anexample, earlier this month we announced that we are seeking an alternativecamera business model which will free up capital for more attractivecategories, such as marketing collateral and retail photo solutions. We havesignificant opportunities to further scale the business and we will focus ourenergies in these areas. As a company, we are executing the plans we have laid outand delivering on our commitments to our customers, partners and investors. Weare effectively balancing growth, investments, and cost reduction initiatives.While our fourth quarter results show marked improvement, we still have work todo and investments to make. Next, I’m going to turn it over to Cathie so that she cangive you some further detail on the numbers and I look forward to seeing you inNew York City at the analyst day where we can give you more details of some ofthe things we’ve talked about.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. HP deliveredanother solid quarter of balanced revenue and operating profit growth. Revenuefor the fourth quarter totaled $28.3 billion, up 15% year over year or up 11% inconstant currency. Non-GAAP operating profit grew 27% year over year to $2.8billion, or 9.9% of revenue. Looking at revenue by geography, each of our regions grew indouble digits, with Asia-Pacific up 20%, EMEA up 19%, and Americas up 10%. Wecontinue to benefit from our broad geographic reach, with 67% of our revenuecoming from outside of the U.S. Fourth quarter gross margin was 24.7%. Compared to a yearago, gross margin was up 40 basis points driven by a generally favorablecommodity environment and disciplined pricing. Strong performance in HPsoftware offset the negative gross margin mix impact of PSG’s strongperformance at the company level. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.2billion, or 14.8% of revenue, an improvement of 50 basis points compared with ayear ago. In absolute dollars, operating expenses grew $430 million, drivenpredominantly by 10 acquisitions completed in FY07 and the affects of currency,as well as investments in sales resources. Going forward, we’ll continue to invest in new areas thathave the potential to drive future growth while remaining focused on optimizingour cost structure. Non-GAAP OI&E yielded income of $67 million, or roughly$0.02 per share. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% in Q4. Fourth quarter non-GAAPEPS was $0.86, up 26% from the $0.68 that we reported one year ago. GAAP EPS was $0.81, which included $132 million, or $0.05per share in after-tax adjustments, primarily related to the amortization ofpurchased intangibles that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. For the full year, we reported revenue of $104.3 billion,non-GAAP operating margin of 9.2%, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.93. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $2.68, which includes $690 million,or $0.25 per share in after-tax adjustments, primarily related to theamortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring, net pension curtailment,and in-process R&D that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Drilling in on the performance by business segment, duringthe fourth quarter imaging and printing revenue grew 4% year over year to $7.6billion, with supplies revenue growth of 6% and commercial hardware revenuegrowth of 5%. Consumer hardware revenue declined 5% year over year, primarilydue to the declines in appliance printers and cameras. Total printer hardware units were up 5% year over year. Thisgrowth is slower than recent periods, reflecting our decision to be moredisciplined in our pricing of appliance printers and a tough prior yearcompare. Excluding appliance printers, total printer hardware units were up 9%year over year. In the consumer business, printer units were up 3% from theprior year, led by solid all-in-one unit growth. In the commercial business,printer hardware units were up 15% year over year, led by color laser printershipments up 17% and printer-based MSP shipments up 26%. In the fourth quarter, IPG delivered solid operating profitof $1.1 billion, or 14.5% of revenue, including a charge of $32 millionreflecting changes in the camera business model. This change in our camerastrategy will have unfavorable impact of approximately one percentage point onIPG revenue in FY08. Going forward, you will see us strategically taking outcosts and realigning resources to build on our core business and accelerate ourinvestments in growth initiatives. Personal systems had another outstanding quarter with everyregion reporting double-digit growth, market share gains, and strong marginperformance. For the first time, revenue in the quarter topped the $10 billionmark, increasing 30% year over year. Unit shipments were up 31% from the prioryear period. The market growth continued to be led by the shift tomobility, consumer demand, and emerging markets. These trends are playing toour strengths and in the fourth quarter, we grew notebook units 57% year overyear. Consumer client revenue was up 40% and total revenue fromemerging markets was up 56% from the prior year period with revenue from China,our third largest market for PCs, up more than 100%. We continue to see momentum in the commercial markets withour commercial client revenues up 24%. Our workstation business grew 31% yearover year as we leveraged a solid product offering combined with strong salesexecution and customer loyalty. Segment operating profit was $589 million, or 5.8% ofrevenue. Compared with the prior year period, PSG operating profit increased75% or $253 million, demonstrating solid sales execution, increased attach, andcost discipline. A favorable commodity environment also contributed to thesestrong operating margin results. Moving now to the technology solutions group, enterprisestorage and service continued to show strong growth in the fourth quarter withrevenue growing 10% year over year to $5.2 billion and operating profitincreasing to 13.5% of revenue. Within ESS, industry-standard servers revenue increased 14%year over year, driven by 78% growth in X86 Blade. Revenue in storage was up 7% year over year, with growth of17% in the mid-range EVA business, partially offset by declines in our tapebusiness. While there is still much room for improvement, we are pleased withthe progress the storage team is making. Business critical systems showed growth in every region thisquarter. In total, BCS revenue for the fourth quarter was up 5% year over year,reflecting improvements in sales coverage and execution. While ESS margins werefavorably impacted by component prices, our margin expansion is also driven byimproved sales execution, pricing discipline, and our ability to reduce costsand invest in growth markets. In the fourth quarter, HP services delivered revenue of $4.4billion, up 7% over the prior year period with balanced 7% growth in each ofour three business units. Operating profit for the quarter was $526 million, or 12% ofrevenue. For the full year, operating margins expanded 140 basis points to 11%of revenue, highlighting the sustained efforts of the team to reduce the costof service delivery. HP Software had an outstanding quarter with revenue of $698million and operating margin of 25.4%, or $177 million, reflecting strongoperational performance of the Open View and Mercury businesses, as well as thebenefits that come with scale. For the full year, HP Software delivered revenue of $2.3billion and operating profit of $347 million. HP financial services had revenue of $657 million, up 21%year over year and generated operating margin of 7.3%. We are encouraged withthe growth in our core financing volume and portfolio assets over the lastseveral quarters, as well as the strong performance in end-of-lease renewalsand equipment sales. Moving now to the balance sheet, HP owned inventory ended Q4at $8 billion, or 34 days of supply, down four days compared with a year ago.With regard to channel inventory, we exited Q4 in good shape. Personal systemsended the quarter with approximately four-and-a-half weeks in the channel, up ahalf-a-week compared with last year and well within our target range. Weeks of channel inventory for imaging and printing andenterprise storage and servers were roughly flat year over year. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $13.4 billion. DSOincreased to 43 days in Q4 from 40 days one year ago. Accounts payable endedthe quarter at $11.8 billion. Days payable was 50 days, down from 59 days lastyear. As we’ve discussed in prior quarters, we will continue toleverage our balance sheet to drive shareholder value. Next, property, plants and equipment was up $935 millionyear over year to $7.8 billion. Gross CapEx was $813 million, down 16% yearover year. On a net basis, CapEx was $748 million, down 14% from the prior yearperiod. Capital expenditures were primarily in IT, real estatefacilities, and assets used in our leasing business. Net PP&E as a percentageof revenue now stands at 7.5% of revenue, flat year over year. Moving on to our cash balance and cash flow, Q4 cash flowfrom operations was $3.6 billion and free cash flow was $2.9 billion. Sharerepurchases during Q4 totaled $2.2 billion -- $2 billion in the open market orapproximately 42 million shares. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $2.7billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization. We announcedtoday that the board has approved an additional share repurchase authorizationof $8 billion. Finally, we paid our quarterly dividend totaling $206million. For the full fiscal year, we returned over $12 billion toshareholders through share repurchases and dividends. At the same time, wespent $6.8 billion for acquisitions. We closed the year with a strong balancesheet, including total gross cash of $11.6 billion and net cash of $3.4billion. Now, a few comments on our outlook for both the firstquarter and the full fiscal year 2008. We expect Q1 fiscal 2008 revenue to be approximately $27.4billion to $27.5 billion. Similar to last quarter, we do not believe it isprudent to set investor expectations that our personal systems business cancontinue to grow at more than twice the market rate, nor do we think it appropriateto build a cost structure on that basis. For the full fiscal year, we expect revenue will beapproximately $111.5 billion. Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to keep inmind. First, we expect the component pricing environment to be moderately lessfavorable in Q1 than it was in Q4. Second, we estimate non-GAAP OI&E to beabout $0.02 per share in Q1 and approximately $0.10 for the full year 2008.Third, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21% for fiscal ’08. Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in thecoming quarters. Share count will be impacted by share price trends, optionexercise patterns, common stock equivalents, and repurchase activity. Currently, we expect a modest decline in weighted averageshares outstanding in Q1. With that in mind, we estimate Q108 non-GAAP EPS of $0.80.For FY08, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.37. All in all, we delivered solid results in FY07 and ourincreased outlook for fiscal 2008 reflects our progress to date. With that, we will now take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from theline of Laura Conigliaro of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Laura Conigliaro -Goldman Sachs: Great. Well, starting with printers, printer unit growth hasbeen coming down pretty noticeably over the past three quarters, as suppliesgrowth too. You’ve got another hard compare in the Jan quarter, suggestinganother mid-single digit unit growth rate and another weak supplies growthrate. How should we be viewing growth in these categories after that? And since you have been working at trying to separatesupplies growth from unit growth, at what point might we start to actually seesome benefit from that without the help of much incremental hardware unitgrowth?
Mark V. Hurd: I’ll start. First, I think good question. We’re prettycomfortable with mid to high single digit supplies growth and I think thatfavorably helps our business model. We’re also comfortable with mid-range,mid-single digit unit growth. To your point, we gained a heck of a lot of share coming offof a pretty rough 2003, 2004 and we’re also being picky about the categorieswe’re competing. Some of the areas, as Cathie noted, in the appliance printerarea, we’re not seeing the supplies connect rate that you might want and sotherefore, we’re putting our money into areas that we think give us betterconnects. So we feel pretty comfortable with where we are headed.Cathie also mentioned that if you actually took out the appliance growth rateon units and then looked at the core inkjet and laserjet, we had a prettyhealthy unity growth rate in the quarter, certainly comparable to what we’veseen in other quarters over the past two-and-a-half years. I think you should think about those rates. If we get intothose levels, which we feel good about, we’ll get favorable treatment in thebusiness model. We feel good about that and we’re continuing to be very toughin this IPG 2.0 transformation to be very focused on making sure that we lookat every piece of the business and look at the value it brings so that we go tothe real core places that we think we have opportunity to improve the business,which is what you saw in the camera business model decision that we described. We’re also working very hard, Laura, and I don’t mean to betoo verbose with this but I want to make sure I give you a clear answer tothis, we’ve worked very hard to ensure that we have channel alignment onsupplies inventory relative to the hardware opportunity during the quarter aswell. So it’s really all of those dynamics tied up together andnet net, you saw that if you took the camera charge out, IPG profit improvedduring the quarter, so we feel pretty good about our opportunities here but westill have a lot of work to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope withJ.P. Morgan.
Bill Shope: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you give us a bit more color onwhat you saw in component pricing and availability situation for the quarter,particularly as you saw it in PCs and as you saw it in servers and how weshould look at that relative to your guidance for next quarter?
Mark V. Hurd: I’ll start, Bill. Commodity pricing was a bit more favorablethan we predicted, particularly in memory. As it relates to Q1, it’s aseasonally tight market as we approach the holidays and supply usuallytightens. The pricing environment is expected to be I’d say generallyfavorable, albeit maybe a little bit less than Q4. We’re navigating sometightness in some categories and yet there are other categories that there’spretty ample supply. So that’s probably my best characterization of thecommodity environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Gardner, Citigroup.
Richard Gardner -Citigroup: Thanks very much. The thing that really stuck out to me inthe quarter was the strength that you had in business critical server and I washoping that you could provide some color on that.
Mark V. Hurd: Well, I mean again, we’re just doing better. I mean, I wishI could give you a whole -- we’ve been obviously looking at this quite a bit.When you look at BCS, which is what we call business critical systems, to yourpoint, we spent a lot of time getting ISVs ported, and we’re up to over 13,000was the last count I saw. And it’s taken us time to get those ISVs ported. It’staken us time to really get our sales force wrapped around it and it’s also --you also have to look at the blend of BCS relative to blades, because there issome alignment of what happens within our user base and the construct of both,and I think the really nice thing about the quarter is the fact that we gotgrowth in BCS and still had the kind of blade growth of 78% blade growth. Thosetwo numbers combined are actually a very, very impressive performance for us. So it’s when you get both combined that you really start tofeel good about the health of our market position out there.
Richard Gardner -Citigroup: Mark, is it just a combination of application ports andbetter sales execution and the fact that the old alpha and PA risk stuff isgetting to be a smaller part of the business, or are there any particularcustomer segments or applications where you are really starting to see somegood traction with Itanium?
Mark V. Hurd: There is no one deal or two deals, so I can put that torest, that drove that answer. It is everything you describe. We obviously hadsome PA risk and alpha comps to have to get through but I would tell you thatsales execution is -- I’ll just word it this way; a great opportunity for us atHewlett-Packard and I think we saw a better version of that in Q4 and wecertainly feel good about it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander ofRaymond James.
Brian Alexander -Raymond James: Mark, just on the revenue guidance for FY08 of 7%, you’veconsistently talked about [the business] as more of a 4% to 6% growth rate. Allthe segments except software for the last couple of years have been guided inthat 4% to 6% range. Obviously you’ve done better than that but I guess thequestion is with increasing economic uncertainty and the law of large numberscreating a bigger hurdle, what gives you the confidence to step up the growthrate for the company and specifically what segments do you expect to do betterthan you’ve gotten before?
Mark V. Hurd: Well, we’re not trying to step up expectations really toofar beyond the model that we described, so at the end of the day you have topeel back the currency impact and then really stare at those local currencygrowth rates. And I think right now what’s in the numbers that Cathie describedto you, as she mentioned is a couple of things. We’ve looked at currency in Q1and we’ve got a pretty good idea of where currency will fall, given how wehedge currencies and how we look at them in the quarter. We are more uncertain about currency in Q2, Q3, and Q4.We’ve seen obviously drastic changes in the Euro and other currencies thatleave us without a precise landing point on where those will be throughout therest of the year, so think of us as giving you a Q1 that we feel pretty goodabout from a currency perspective with a Q2 through Q4 with a little lesscertainty. That said, at the end of the day we like our position inmany of the markets that we are in. We are working very hard on our coststructure. We are realigning within the context of the cost structure that yousee and if you were to peel back even our SG&A and took out acquisitionsand took out currency, we’ve had very little increase in SG&A over the --and driving all of this growth with very little increase and yet even withinthat little increase, we’ve been able to put more feet on the street. So as Cathie mentioned, and I think it’s worth reiterating,we build business models that don’t have exorbitant growth rates in them. Webuild them on the model that you just reiterated back to me. We then putpressure on our expense structure and then we try to align as much go-to-marketcapacity and R&D capacity inside that tighter business model. And what thatallows us to do is if the growth is there, we’re able to take it or participatein it, let me put it that way, and then able to see it roll within our businessmodel. So we’re doing more of the same, Brian. That’s what I woulddescribe to you and that’s how we see fiscal year ’08. We’ll let the economywork its way through. Hopefully it’s better than some of the doomsayers predictand if it is, we hope to be able to benefit from that.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of UBS.
Benjamin Reitzes -UBS: Good afternoon, thanks. Just with regard to the economy,Mark, could you just talk a little bit more about that? In context, are youstill a third consumer, would you say? And can you talk about your exposure tofinancials and just in general, you’re still guiding for the next quarter 9% to10% growth, so it seems like HP is plugging along. Just putting your ownperformance in context with the market a little more and talking a little bitmore in consumer in certain segments, especially financials, would be helpful,if you can.
Mark V. Hurd: Well, I’ll do my best but I mean I just -- again, I don’twant to be confused with an economist in any way, shape or form. We’re just --we know a lot about our company and we know a lot about our funnels and thevisibility of that and frankly, that’s what I’ll comment on. You know, we saw again, if you looked at our performance, wesaw solid growth across all businesses and regions and in remembering ourdemographics, 67% of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. If you looked at,as I mentioned, the brick countries of Brazil, Russia, India and China, we grew37%. It’s now 9% of our revenue and we saw strong growth in all of thoseregions. We’re executing well in some of our key markets -- PCs, blades,software. I mean, you’ve heard that story today. So on a worldwide basis, to give you some context onfinancial services, we are probably not the best one to ask about that marketbecause we just actually -- we have limited exposure to the financial servicesmarket. I won’t give you a precise number but it’s not a big number. Now, within that not a big number, we saw really no materialweakness in financial services and again, we’re largely under-penetrated inthat market so it’s -- big markets for us inside financial services aresub-segments like stock exchanges, which even in this market are actually doingpretty well. I wish I could give you more but we’re not -- we’re actuallytrying to get more exposed to financial services by actually selling more intothat industry. We see it as a big opportunity for us but currently it’s notnearly as big as we’d like it. But again, we saw no material weakness in itduring the quarter.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi of SanfordBernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on that previousquestion. Mark, the United States was the only region whose growth rate actuallydecelerated in the quarter and your guidance is calling for revenue growth atconstant currency to go from 10% this quarter to 5% next quarter. I appreciatethe not wanting to get ahead of yourselves in terms of PCs, but to hit thatrevenue growth rate, PCs has to decelerate from about 30% revenue growth to asingle-digit number. So are you being conservative overall or is there anythingthat I’m inferring about what we saw in the deceleration in the U.S. and yourguidance that is causing you to be more conservative?
Catherine A. Lesjak: Toni, I think it’s really the deceleration in PSG that isdriving our guidance in Q1, and I don’t really see it as single-digityear-over-year growth deceleration but there is some deceleration. It still isfaster than the market and we still expect to increase market share in Q1. But again, we’ve been cautious about our PSG businessbasically each and every quarter, not wanting to get a cost structure ahead ofwhere our revenue is going to come in. So that’s really what’s driving a lot ofour revenue seasonality Q4 to Q1.
Toni Sacconaghi: And any comment on the deceleration in the U.S. thisquarter, relative to all other regions in the world?
Mark V. Hurd: No, not really. It’s kind of again a broad story, and Iusually don’t like to get into too much detail in all this, but I will for thesake of this call, since I know there’s interest. We did grow 7% so overall, itwas faster than the high end of our 4% to 6% range that we typically give thecompany. When we grow 7% overall, even though we’ve had other quarters betterthan that, we don’t feel too bad because it treats our business model veryfavorably. Now, inside that, we had some better performance in theenterprise than we’ve seen in the past and again, I’ve heard a lot of commentsabout enterprise but if you looked at it sequentially, we actually saw someimprovements in enterprise in the U.S. PSG continued along roughly where it hasbeen in the U.S. and then we did do some of our work in the printing segment inthe U.S. that I described earlier to an earlier question, so that was kind ofthe story in the U.S. for us, overall at 7% was not a bad quarter for us.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harry Blount of LehmanBrothers.
Harry Blount: I’m actually going to come back to the full year FY08guidance, sorry to do this but it looks to me like if we assume you guys dobenefit from the dollar, say the dollar stays flat just where it’s at and takea look at where the average price of the dollar was in fiscal ’07, it lookslike you might be getting three to four points currency benefit there, and ifyou make another point or two of acquisitions, it almost looks like theguidance is assuming very low single digit organic year-over-year growth, andI’d love for you to comment on that a little bit.
Catherine A. Lesjak: As Mark mentioned, we feel pretty comfortable with thecurrency for Q1 and we factored that into our Q1 guidance but it’s just too uncertainwhat Q2 to Q4 is going to look like, and so we took a very conservative stanceon currency. If currency turns out to be more favorable than what we’vegot, then we will have built a cost structure that will allow for some niceexpansion on the bottom line with the increase in growth.
Mark V. Hurd: Harry, while Cathie gives you a great analytical answer, Iwant to make sure I’m clear that I hope you just don’t go bake in all thecurrent currency into your model because we’re just unsure of where this thingis going to land. We’ve done that within the context of Q1, as I mentionedearlier, because we think we’ve got pretty good visibility over the course ofthe next 75 days, but that’s kind of where our visibility runs out. Now, to your point, if currency stays where it is or gets alittle better, we may do better but again, our business model is what we’vebeen describing all along. We try to make sure that we are very disciplined inour ability to align costs to growth and it’s very easy to get into a currencymodel that justifies a whole lot of spending. And I can tell you that I am notup for that. What I am up for is a disciplined approach to the year andwithin the cost structure that we can afford, at a revenue level that we canhave visibility to that we realign our cost structure to put us in the bestposition to capture that revenue if it shows up. We’ll see how the year unfolds but that’s how we built ourmodel and that’s where we are.
Harry Blount: Got it. I was just -- it looks like in the context of theoverall marketplace, it looks like you guys are being very conservative on anyassumptions for organic growth.
Mark V. Hurd: Well, thank you, Harry.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Neff of BearStearns.
Andrew Neff: Sure. I just wanted to go back to question earlier thatasked about the consumer outlook. I guess if Mark, if you could just talk aboutthe consumer side of the business, is it still around a third of your business?What were you seeing in different regions as to what consumer behavior was? Anysigns -- you talked about the commercial activity, that you weren’t seeing anysigns of weakness there. Just give us a sense about what the consumer istelling you at this point.
Mark V. Hurd: I’ll do my best. The numbers you described are roughlyright. I mean, within a third, a third, a third, that being a third consumer, athird being what’s a broader definition of small and medium business, and thena third being the enterprise. Within that, I gave you some color. The color Iwas giving you was particularly on the U.S. enterprise earlier about seeingsome improvement there. Again, I wouldn’t run away with excitement on thatimprovement. When you look at it actual numbers, we improved sequentially overthe course of the year in our position in the enterprise in the U.S. Within the consumer market, to try to give you more color,we saw strong growth in certain product categories so -- and this is again alittle bit more depth than I usually give but I know it’s a topic of keeninterest. We saw very strong consumer desire for notebooks, so demand wasstrong. Demand was strong in some printer categories more than others, so therewas sort of a mix within the printer category, as there was a mix in the PCcategory. I think when you knit the whole consumer segment togetherglobally and across all product lines, we saw steady demand across the consumerand that’s a global-across-all-product-lines sort of statement. I know a lot ofdata, but unfortunately there’s a lot of points to cover and that’s roughlywhat I would describe our position as.
Andrew Neff: Do you sense any hesitance on the part of the channel incarrying inventories going into -- are they concerned about the consumer?
Mark V. Hurd: I think it again goes back to, without taking in theindividual retailer’s position, so let’s take that aside, on a broad statementbasis it still comes back to the categories. I think when you look at the categories,there are some printer segments where the channel is very excited. There aresome PC segments where the channel is very excited and I tried to give youcolor, so I think the channel behavior pretty much mirrors the consumer demandstory that I just described. And we’re seeing no -- if your question is giventhat consumer demand, are you seeing aberative behavior on the part of the retailersbecause of say the credit crunch, and I’m putting words in your mouth andthat’s not what you asked, but my answer to that question would be no, we’renot seeing that.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross ofCross Research.
Shannon Cross: Good afternoon. Looking at your cash flow, inventory wasextremely solid quarter over quarter but AR continued to trend up. How shouldwe think about cash flow and working capital management as we go into fiscal2008, especially with the $8 billion share repurchase and what should we thinkabout -- maybe we’re jumping the gun here from what you’re going to be tellingus at the analyst day in a couple of weeks, but any color you can give would begreat.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Sure. We’re going to continue to leverage our balance sheetto drive shareholder value. We’ve got a really strong balance sheet and we wantto take the best use of it, so we are making economic trade-offs to takeadvantage of cash discounts from suppliers, adjusting payment terms with ourcustomers that will allow us to drive more profitable growth, and we’ll continueto look at these trade-ups. We look at them very analytically to make sure thatthey do in fact add value, and that’s really what has driven the extension ofDSO and frankly the contraction of accounts payable. The other item on accounts payable is that we did change thelinearity of purchases in this quarter and that was heavily driven by somestrategic buys that we made early in the quarter that were really there todrive and assure us supply, especially in LCDs. So we made some very early andwise purchases in the quarter, which changes the linearity and of course thenthe mass for how DPOs actually calculated.
Mark V. Hurd: I also would like to make sure that the inventory work wedid over the quarter was a lot of work on the part of the company. We’ve hadsome issues in Q1 and we wanted to make sure we really did the right job hereand I would tell you, this is not a demand signal either. This was just ustrying to get the optimal inventory conclusion at the end of the year. So to Cathie’s point, we are very mindful of the alignmentbetween DSO, DPO being payables, of course, and then the inventory and howthose asset metrics play again back into the total performance of the business. I mean, inventory -- just that one metric could be a very confusingmetric because you can describe that less inventory is good but to be veryblunt, you can in some cases have more inventory and increase your profitmargins. So when you look at the way you use logistics and the way you leveragelogistics across the globe, so we actually have a bit more complex process thatwe go through than just simply let’s lower inventory and let’s get payables tothe highest number we possibly can. We have to align the balance sheet metricand we have to align it with the income statement and then we have to look atthe best return on our invested capital that we get for the alignment of allthose metrics. So it’s a case where -- you know, I like metrics but you canget over-metricized in this area if you’re not careful. You have to look at theintegration of these metrics, and so what we do and Cathie and I spent a lot oftime on this, and I would tell you that Cathie’s done a great job aligning theclarity of these metrics to make sure we clearly understand what drives more shareholdervalue.
Shannon Cross: Okay, and so as we look at fiscal ’08 to fiscal 2008 -- orsorry, fiscal ’07 to fiscal ’08, is there anything that’s dramatically changingfrom any of the metrics from a working capital standpoint? Or should we assumebusiness as usual as we factor in and try to figure out our cash flow numbersfor ’08?
Catherine A. Lesjak: You should assume business as usual. There will be no -- atthis point, we don’t anticipate any big changes to our working capital metricsbut the reality is we look at this on a fairly real-time basis to make sure wemake the right decisions to drive the best value for the shareholder. But ingeneral, we’re basically calling for them to be about this level.
Mark V. Hurd: I think the big wildcard really is if we have more successin the enterprise, and the enterprise has some different DSO metrics and thosecan affect you. It’s sort of like if you are successful, there are some thingsthat come with the price of success that we have to deal with. So if we arevery successful this year, it could throw us off a bit on those metrics butagain, that’s not what we’ve got blended into our models. We think we knowwhere we are headed in the enterprise and I would agree with Cathie -- this is businessas usual for us and we are going to continue to be very focused on thesemetrics.
Catherine A. Lesjak: And before we get off of the topic of receivables, I thinkyou should never walk away feeling that we have any concern about our abilityto collect receivables. We don’t see any degradation in credit quality, so ourreceivables move out with a conscious decision and a reflection of theenterprise growth that we are getting and we are very comfortable that we’llcollect the receivables and generate the cash.
Shannon Cross: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty ofMorgan Stanley.
Katie Huberty -Morgan Stanley: Mark, do you have any insight as to whether the recentacceleration in emerging market PC unit growth is coming from real secularimprovements and adoption rates that should continue into next year versus moreshort-term cyclical or currency factors that would be driving that incrementaldemand?
Mark V. Hurd: They’re not currency factors, Katie. I think it’s a verygood question, the one that you raise. I do think as we’ve mentioned inprevious calls, this explosion of content that’s going on around the planet isa big driver, so when you think of the content, there’s words out there,analysis out there that the sheer size of global content, whether it’s producedby ESPN or News Corp or coming off the web at Yahoo!, the content is doublingevery 18 months. And when you get people across the globe that want access tothat content and you take places in some of these markets you’re describingwhere the only access that the person has to that content is through a notebookand a wireless card, because land lines are not nearly as pervasive as whatyou’ll see in markets like the U.S. And that’s why I always caution people, theU.S. is 5% of the world’s consumers. Ninety-five percent of them are not hereand when you look at some of the emerging markets, the necessity of some ofthis technology is more of a staple than I think what some of us typicallythink. We see good growth in those markets and our distribution inmarkets like China and in markets like India and markets like Eastern Europeare increasing. So we feel very good about the trends we are seeing in terms ofthe number of people that want access to that content and our opportunity tocompete for that. I feel good about it. I would not call any of this unitgrowth you are seeing there as currency driven, at least from what we areseeing. We think it is strong, natural demand based on the content and theaccess to it.
Jim Burns: We’ll take two more questions, Operator.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley ofFTN Midwest.
William Fearnley -FTN Midwest Securities: Good afternoon. I wanted to shift gears, if I could, tostorage, Mark. Could you provide more color on the segment, the demand and thepricing environment for HP storage in light of some of the cautious commentaryfrom some of your competitors? And should we expect any M&A moves by HP,especially in storage hardware or storage software segments here in theupcoming year? Thanks.
Mark V. Hurd: While I know this is an [imminent] call, I probably wouldn’tgo into much M&A detail on this call, other than to say we continue to havea filter of something that makes strategic sense, it makes financial sense, andwe can actually run it and operate it. Storage again, given what’s happeningwith the world’s content, it’s got to be created, it’s got to be moved, it’sgot to be processed, it’s got to be stored and it’s got to be visualized andgot to be printed, and storage is one of those key attributes. So storage is a place that we have interest in growing ourposition. That said, organically our position improved. I mean, EVA growth, ourmid-range EVA systems grew 17%, which is one of the better numbers that we’veseen and so we are happy with EVA growth. I continue to think you are going to see growth, Bill, morein that low-end mid-range area, particularly as those storage capabilitiesbegin to have more -- I don’t know what the right word for it is --reliability. They are now more accepted in the enterprise, not just through themid-market. So we feel good about our position there but we grew 7% here in thequarter and while we feel good about that, we could do better. We still have a tape business that is not growing the way wewould like and the high end is still behaving more like the mainframe market,as opposed to like the mid-range market and the lower end of the storage market. So even within storage, Bill, there’s a number of differentdimensions you have to get under. We feel very good about our MSA, which is ourlow end, and our mid-range EVA line and our opportunity to scale in that marketand we’ll continue to invest into that.
Jim Burns: Let’s take one last question, please.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Keith Bachman ofBank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: Under the wire -- Mark, a question on the profitabilityside, what was traditionally enterprise systems or ESG. The systems in thesoftware side had noticeable improvements in the operating margin. I thinksoftware had some noticeable help from the Merc fall-off on the accountingside, but how should we be thinking about sustained levels of profitability inthese two divisions in particular? Thanks.
Mark V. Hurd: I’ll start and let Cathie chime in. I think on software, wegave a range a year ago of getting the software business to look like what ascaled software business ought to look like, and we gave ranges in ’08 ofroughly 18% to 22%. We’ve done nothing to change that view. We believe that thesoftware business has done a nice job integrating Mercury, as well as severalother acquisitions during the year, Keith. It wasn’t just Mercury. They’ve also done a nice job organically of building up ourorganic capabilities at the same time as we’ve been doing some integration, sowe feel real good about the operationalization of all that and I think you’llsee that platform that I described with the Mercury integration generating thekind of profit levels that we described. Now, as Cathie mentioned in her prepared statements that shementioned, we’ve got a couple of things that we’re going to move in and thatincludes our business intelligence offering and our information managementofferings, and those segments have typically been in ESS, and we are movingthem in because we think they are strategically better aligned in thego-to-market model of software than they are in ESS. And they are embryonic innature, which -- or I can use the word strategic or embryonic, most of themmean that they don’t generate great operating income at the current time but wethink the will in the future. So we are going to move them into software sowhat you’ll see in ’08 is us reporting the traditional way we think of softwareas we reported this quarter, which we think is healthy and projected to behealthy, relative to the models we described, plus these new segments that comein. So if you didn’t fall asleep listening to all that, I amgoing to let Cathie give you some more color.
Catherine A. Lesjak: We will provide additional guidance in Q1 on exactly whatthe impact was of moving these embryonic businesses from ESS and the support piecefrom HP Services, but it’s important to note that the software margin will bedampened by, at least at the beginning of the year, by the move of these assetsinto software for next year.
Keith Bachman: And how about on the system side, Cathie?
Catherine A. Lesjak: So we saw good improvement on system margins, both fromcommodity prices but it was actually way more than that. We also had goodwarranty improvement, good attach, good channel -- I’m sorry, not channel,supply chain efficiencies as well, and so we are feeling very, very good aboutthe ESS performance and our ability to continue to improve in that area. Andfrankly, take expenses out where appropriate with respect to our businesscritical systems business. As its gross margin has come down, we’ve also beenable to realign our cost structure in that area.
Mark V. Hurd: Keith, ESS did a very nice job from a productivityperspective. To Cathie’s point, they generated the kind of growth that wereported today and did a very nice job on their expense structure as they didit, so again it’s an example of us -- ESS is not a place, Keith, that we wentout with big revenue projections going forward. Now they’ve delivered on thatbecause we’ve been able to keep our expenses very contained and even withinESS, as I mentioned, we’ve actually been able to align more of that to pureR&D and to the go-to-market model. And so as a result, when we see theopportunity in blades or BCS, we are now able to go do more work and bring thatrevenue into the company. So I think that’s a group that -- I’ll give it ashort-term thing because they’ll probably listen to the call and I don’t wantto laud anybody too much, but in this quarter did what we really -- we’d expectthem to do.
Keith Bachman: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Mark V. Hurd: Okay, let me close up from there and I really do appreciateyour questions. I’ll summarize today’s call by saying that we had a strongquarter, characterized by double-digit growth across all of our regions, sharegains in key businesses, margin expansion, expense discipline, and significantshare repurchases. We did this while continuing to make progress on improvingour cost structure and investing in our strategic initiatives that we believe willstrengthen Hewlett-Packard’s long-term competitive positioning. Given the solid fundamentals within our business, we areincreasing non-GAAP EPS guidance for the ninth consecutive quarter and I ampleased with our progress to date and I am confident that we can continue toexecute with discipline and produce another year of strong financial returns. Finally, we do look forward to seeing you in New York Cityat our annual securities analyst meeting on December 11th, and I thank youagain for joining the call.
Operator: Thank you very much, sir and thank you, ladies andgentlemen, for your participation in today’s presentation. You may nowdisconnect. Have a good day.

===== 2007 Q3  (2007-08-17 18:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the 2007 third-quarter Hewlett-Packard earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of today’s presentation. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Jim Burns, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jim Burns: Good afternoon and welcome to our third-quarter earnings conference call with Chairman and CEO Mark Hurd, and CFO Cathie Lesjak. This call is being webcast live, and a replay of the webcast will be available shortly after the call for approximately one year. Some information provided during this call may include forward-looking statements that are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. Please refer to the risks described in HP’s SEC reports, including our Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2007. The financial information discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on the information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP’s third fiscal quarter Form 10-Q. Earnings, operating margins and similar items at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and have been adjusted to exclude certain lines, including amortization of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges. The comparable GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables and in the third-quarter earnings slide presentation accompanying today’s earnings release, both of which are available on the HP Investor Relations web page under company Information at www.hp.com. Finally, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications during the Q&A. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Hurd: I’m actually okay with the multi-part questions; it’s just Jim that doesn’t like those. Anyway, let me start by first thanking you for joining us. HP delivered a real strong quarter in Q3. We had our strongest revenue growth since 2000. We had share gains in our key businesses. We had expense discipline and we had operating margin expansion and we did do significant share buybacks. We also continued to invest in the long-term health of our businesses. We increased operating margins and demonstrated strong operating leverage across the company with a year-over-year operating profit increased of 89% in the Personal Systems Group, 45% in the Technology Solutions Group, and 11% in Imaging and Print Group. Let me walk you through the financial highlights of the quarter. Includes revenue of $25.4 billion, that’s up 16% year-over-year or $3.5 billion. This brings our year-to-date growth in dollars to $8.9 billion. Year-over-year operating margin expansion at all of our non-financing businesses, Personal Systems margins of 5.8%. IPG margins of 14.5%, Enterprise Storage and Server margins of 10.2%, HP Services margins of 10.3%, and HP Software margins of 14.6%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9%, up from 7.6% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, and that’s up 37% versus the prior year period. And we did do $2.5 billion of share repurchases. We posted these strong third quarter results while continuing to deploy our capital in the longer-term strategic initiatives that we expect will strengthen HP’s competitive position here in the market. We remain focused on our cost initiatives in order to create a more competitive company for the long-term. We concluded the completed the construction of our 6 new data centers and are executing against our plans to consolidate our infrastructure and application to these new sites. In addition, we announced several new acquisitions this quarter that will add market-leading solutions to areas of our business that will drive future growth and profitability. This quarter, we signed definitive agreements to purchase Opsware and Neoware and closed our acquisition of STI Dynamics on August 1st. Each brings leadership to our already powerful management software and business PC portfolios. They are expected to enhance our ability to help companies in voice automation and virtualization and we’ll have structural advantages in the areas of cost, reliability and data security. We also expect that the Opsware acquisition will significantly enhance our capability end-to-end data center automation. STI adds application security testing capabilities, quality management, and Neoware will provide added competencies in client virtualization. Now, let me turn to the business segments in the third quarter results. IPG had a solid quarter; revenue grew 8% year-over-year, $6 billion with supplies revenue up 9%, or growth of 9%; commercial hardware revenue up 6%, and consumer hardware revenue up 10%. Demand for our products remain strong with printer hardware shipments exceeding 13 million units in the quarter representing 10% unit growth year-over-year. Commercial printer hardware units grew 17% and consumer printer hardware units were up 8%, both off tough prior year compares. Technology that we bring to the markets, along with industry-leading technology, commercial hardware shipments continue to be led by our strong lineup of printer MFPs, which grew 76% versus the prior-year period, while our consumer business saw increasing acceptance of all its all-in-one products. Segment operating margin grew to 14.5%, that’s up 30 basis points versus the prior year period in line with our guidance last quarter. We expanded our operating margins while continuing to invest in unit placement and product innovation highlighting the strength of our core printing business and solid expense discipline. We expect these investments to extend our printing leadership to help us drive the market transition from analog to digital printing. Moving to PSG, we shared an outstanding quarter with excellent revenue growth, market share gains in every region and strong margin performance. Revenue increased 29% year-over-year to $8.9 billion with unit shipments up 33% and double digit revenue in unit growth in every region. These results bring PSG’s year-to-date revenue growth to nearly $5 billion. We have a strong momentum driven by our notebook business which grew revenues 54%, and units 71% versus the prior year period. According to our estimates for the second calendar quarter, we increased HP’s notebook market share lead by over 5 points versus the prior year. Consumer client revenues jumped 46% over the prior year period as customers continue to value our innovation, service and the ability to purchase at more than 80,000 retail storefronts worldwide. We also saw continued solid performance in our commercial client business, with revenues up 19%, including improved results in the public sector, where we have been traditionally underpenetrated. Revenue in desktops grew 12% year-over-year with double-digit growth in both consumer and commercial and share gains in every region. Workstation revenues were up 30% versus the prior-year period. Segment operating profit was $519 million or 5.8% of revenue, up from 4% in the prior-year period. On a year-over-year basis, PSG grew operating profit $244 million, demonstrating solid sales execution, increased attach and cost discipline. While we’re pleased with these operating margin results, we did experience a benefit this quarter from lower component prices, which we do not expect to be sustainable in future periods. Moving on to TSG, enterprise servers and storage grew 10% year-over-year to $4.5 billion. Operating profit was $464 million or 10.2% of revenue, a sharp increase from 7.2% in the prior-year period. In ESS, revenue did grow 10% to $4.5 billion. Operating profit was $464 million or 10.2% of revenue, a sharp increase from 7.2% in the prior-year period. Industry Standard Server revenues grew 16% year-over-year, with share gains across all regions. x86 blades were up… accelerated to 81% over the prior year as customers continued to embrace the power and cooling management and virtualization advantages of our c-Class blades. Revenue in Storage was up 6% year-over-year, with a solid performance in our external disk products, which grew 7%, partially offset by a decline in tape. Our flagship midrange EVA revenues increased 14% versus the prior year. And in May, we introduced the new lineup of our high-end XP storage systems. While we have a lot more work to do, I am encouraged by the improvement in the top-line performance of the storage business. Business Critical Systems revenue decreased 3% year-over-year. Integrity server revenue grew 71% and represented 67% of Business Critical revenue, up from 38% in the prior-year period. Integrity momentum was offset by ongoing declines in PA-RISK and Alpha. While ESS margins were favorably impacted by petroleum prices, our margin expansion also highlights warranty improvements, pricing discipline, and our ability to align our cost structure investments to deliver the next-generation data center to our customers. We had a solid quarter in HP Services, with revenue growth of 8% over the prior year period of $4.2 billion. On a year-over-year basis, Outsourcing Services and Consulting and Integration each delivered 11% topline growth while Technology Services grew 5%. HP Services operating profit of $430 million, or 10.3% of revenue, was up 0.9 points year over year. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin expansion in HP Services and I am pleased with the improved consistency in this business. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on executing our plans to streamline our cost structure and improve our delivery tools and processes to become more competitive in the market. HP Software revenue grew 74% over the prior-year period to $554 million, which reflects the impact of the acquisition of Mercury Interactive in the first quarter of the year. On a year-over-year basis, HP OpenView was up 14% and that excludes Mercury. HP Software reported an operating profit of $81 million or 14.6% of revenue, up 10.5 points versus the prior-year period. HP Software performed as planned and I'm pleased with our efforts to date and the contribution of the integrated management team. HP Financial Services revenue was $582 million or up 12% year-over-year. Volume and net portfolio assets increased 7% and 8% over the prior year period, respectively. Operating margin was 6.7%, flat with the prior year. We are encouraged with the growth in our core financing volume and portfolio assets over the last several quarters and results in end-of-lease renewals and equipment sales. I will conclude my comments on segments with that, reiterating we had a strong third quarter across the entire portfolio. And as a company, we're executing on the plans we have laid out, delivering on our commitments to customers and investors, and effectively balancing our growth, investments, and cost reduction opportunities. And while our third quarter results showed marked improvement, I want to make sure you are clear, we still have significant investments and opportunities ahead of us. The initial results of our Enterprise sales force deployment are encouraging. However, we're still not adequately covering this segment and we will be adding additional feet on the street to expand our share of wallet. At the same time that we're investing to grow our business, we will need to take the necessary actions, which include incremental workforce reductions to lower our cost structure. I'm pleased with our progress but as a company, we still have plenty of work ahead. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Cathie.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. HP had another strong quarter in Q3, with solid revenue and operating profit expansion in each of its businesses. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $25.4 billion, up 16% year-over-year or up 12% in constant currency. And non-GAAP operating profit grew 38% year-over-year to $2.3 billion or 9% of revenue. Looking at revenue by geography; each of our regions grew in double digits, with Asia-Pacific up 22%; EMEA, up 16%; and Americas, up 14%. Adjusting for currency, revenue was up 18% in Asia-Pacific, 9% in EMEA, and 13% in the Americas. We continue to benefit from our broad geographic reach with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S. In fact, revenue from the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, grew 35% in Q3 and now accounts for 8% of total revenue. Third-quarter gross margin was 24.5% of revenue, unchanged from Q2. Compared to a year ago, gross margin percentage was down by 30 basis points, driven by strong growth in the Personal Systems Group and by shifts in product mix within Imaging and Printing. These factors were only partially offset by favorable pricing of commodity components and by a higher percentage of the Company's revenue coming from software. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were 15.5% of revenue, an improvement of 170 basis points compared with a year ago and flat sequentially. In absolute dollars, operating expenses grew only 4.5% year-over-year to $3.9 billion, less than one-third the rate of revenue growth. Adjusting for currency, expenses grew by only 2.3% year-over-year even as we absorbed the operating expenses associated with eight acquisitions. Going forward, we will continue to invest in new areas that have the potential to drive future growth, while at the same time remaining focused on optimizing our cost structure. Non-GAAP OI&E yielded a pretax income of $170 million or roughly $0.05 per share. The increase reflects gains on real estate transactions during the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 22.4% in Q3, reflecting roughly $0.02 per share in incremental tax expenses associated with nonrecurring items. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to return to 20% in Q4 and then, as we've previously discussed, to go up to 21% in FY08. Third quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.71, up 37% from the $0.52 that we reported one year ago. GAAP EPS was $0.66, which includes $134 million or $0.05 per share in after-tax adjustments primarily related to the amortization of purchased intangibles that were excluded from our non-GAAP results. Moving now to the balance sheet; HP-owned inventory ended Q3 at $8 billion, up $728 million sequentially and up $542 million year-over-year. Inventory now stands at 38 days of supply, down 3 days from that with the year ago but up 4 days sequentially. We believe that our current inventory levels are appropriate as we head into our seasonally strongest quarter. With regard to channel inventories, we exited Q3 in good shape. Personal Systems ended the quarter with five weeks in the channel or flat compared with last year. Imaging and Printing ended the quarter at approximately six weeks of channel inventory or up about half a week from last year. And Enterprise Storage and Servers ended the quarter at roughly 4.5 weeks or down about half a week year-over-year. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $11.8 billion, up $2.2 billion year-over-year and $268 million sequentially. DSO increased to 42 days in Q3 from 41 days in Q2 and 40 days one year ago. Our strong finish to the quarter was a significant contributor to the increase in DSO. Next, Property, Plant, and Equipment was up $1.1 billion year-over-year and $140 million sequentially at $7.5 billion. Gross CapEx was $751 million, up 21% year-over-year and flat sequentially. On a net basis, CapEx was $548 million, up 41% year-over-year and down 8% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in CapEx was primarily the result of increases in assets used in our leased business. Net PP&E, as a percentage of revenue, now stands at 7.4% of revenue, up from 7.1% one year ago and down from 7.6% last quarter. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 55 days, up from 54 last quarter and down from 58 days one year ago. Moving to our cash balance and cash flow; cash flow from operations ended the quarter at $1.9 billion and free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Capital expenditures were primarily in IT and real estate facilities and assets used in our leasing business. Q3 share repurchases totaled $2.5 billion in open market or approximately 55 million shares. In addition, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program announced in Q2, receiving approximately 2 million additional shares. At the end of the quarter, we had roughly $4.8 billion remaining in the current share repurchase authorization. Finally, we paid our normal quarterly dividend totaling $209 million. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $12.5 billion, down from $16 billion last year and up sequentially from $12.3 billion. Net cash was $3.9 billion, down from $9.2 billion last year and $4 billion last quarter. Finally, a few comments on our outlook; we are increasing our revenue and EPS guidance for the fourth quarter. We now expect Q4 revenue to be approximately $27 billion to $27.2 billion, growing roughly 10% to 11% year-over-year. While the sequential increase of 6% to 7% implied by our guidance is less than the historical 10% to 12%, we do not believe it is prudent to set investor expectations that our Personal Systems business can continue to grow at almost three times the market rate, nor do we think it appropriate to build a cost structure on that basis. Regarding earnings, there are many variables to keep in mind. First, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth and to make workforce rebalancing investments at levels similar to those in Q3. Second, we expect component pricing environment to be less favorable in Q4 than it was in Q3. In fact, we have already seen memory prices beginning to incline. Third, we estimate non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.02 per share in Q4, down from $0.05 in Q3 which included about $0.03 in one-time real estate gains. Fourth, as mentioned earlier, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% for Q4. Finally, we expected to continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters. Share count will be impacted by share price trend, option exercise patterns, common stock equivalents and repurchase activity. Currently, we expect weighted average shares outstanding to decline slightly in Q4. With all this in mind, we now expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80 to $0.81, representing 18% to 19% growth year over year. With that, we will take your questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Richard Gardner of Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: Thank you for taking the question. Mark, the obvious question on everybody’s mind is whether you have seen any changes in demand out there related to the recent turmoil in the financial markets. So, I guess if you could give us your assessment of what demand looks like by geography and customer segment to the degree that you are willing. And then also, does your guidance for the fourth quarter reflect any change in the demand environment that you have seen here of late, given how far below normal seasonality you're guiding?
Mark Hurd: I am not an economist, just so we get that on the record. We saw steady growth across all regions and all segments. So it was pretty broadbased from that perspective. I don't have any data that would indicate to me any material change in demand in any segments of any market. So I will just leave it at that. Obviously, we will continue to monitor things. But that is what we have seen. So I will leave it there.
Richard Gardner: Okay, thanks for it.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes with UBS.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks, if you could just talk a little bit about, I guess… this is sort of in line with the demand question, but as we go into back-to-school and what not, in terms of IPG and PSG, what do your channel inventory levels look like? It looked like IPG is at the higher end of your ranges. And talk a little bit more about how comfortable you are going into back-to-school, particularly when the consumer is the particularly big area that picks up for you in the next quarter?
Cathie Lesjak: We are very comfortable with our channel inventory position. Our PSG channel inventory typically goes up from Q3 just to be ready for this kind of uptick in back-to-school. And we are ready for it. Our IPG inventory is at the higher end of our range but most of the increase was there in the supplies. So, that is really the product you don’t mind having out in the channel because you don’t want any opportunity to sock out. So, we are very comfortable with channel inventory.
Mark Hurd: [Inaudible] not just adding to it, it is in exceptional shape, so, we feel good about ESS, we feel good about… I want to add more to Cathie’s point. We simply feel good about where we are.
Ben Reitzes: And PSG, I guess as well?
Mark Hurd: PSG, we think is in superb position.
Cathie Lesjak: Absolutely.
Mark Hurd: I think, again, given the demand signs we have seen and the data we have got, we feel really good about where we ended the quarter from a channel inventory perspective, and for that matter, from an owned inventory perspective. So I think overall, we feel really good about things.
Ben Reitzes: Thank you very much, Mark.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Bill Shope of JP Morgan.
Bill Shope: Mark, can you help us understand a bit more of some of the drivers of the ESS margin upside and in particular to help us understand how much of it is sustainable? And also, should we expect normal seasonal increases in the margins on that segment going into fourth quarter?
Mark Hurd: Let me be clear too. We had some good component help but this whole story is not a component story. There is a bunch of things going on here, starting with just the fact of us getting disciplined on our pricing. The fact that we could be disciplined on pricing at the same time as we have this kind of growth is good news, and so, pricing discipline is probably number one. Secondly, we have been very good with product quality. And that has helped us on the warranty line. Warranty is a big driver, as you know, or potentially can be a driver of product costs. In this case, it really helped. And then you add the component prices to it. Some of the component pricing issues it is kind of interesting because we are the largest customer of most of these folks, so we're not sure how much component pricing we get when you're already at the best pricing or at least we think we are. But those are the drivers and so it will depend on the market and depend on different factors at different times and how this goes. But I wouldn't want you to leave you all with the thought that there's one big component pricing, it is a mix of things that occur. We will try our best in the areas that we can sustain to sustain.
Bill Shope: Great, thank you.
Operator: Your next question is from the line of Harry Blount of Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.
Harry Blount: Hi, staying on the margin question, you are tracking a fair amount, I think, ahead of what some of your plans were that you laid out at Analyst Day. Beyond the component side of the equation, you appear to also to have done pretty well on the services side and on the margin side and also upsided on revenue on the IPG side. So perhaps you could comment a little bit on your thoughts around margins for those two segments as well as the success of the IPG salesforce.
Cathie Lesjak: We are very pleased with the operating margin expansion that we saw this quarter. As you mentioned, it is broadbased; in many of the segments, it is coming from improved gross margin position but it is also coming from great OpEx discipline. So we are getting a lot of this growth on a very stable OpEx structure that is allowing us to really… basically from our perspective, do a great job on operating profit. And we expect a lot of that to continue. To Mark's point earlier, the commodity prices were a nice tailwind in Q3. We are not expecting that much of a tailwind in Q4 but we still expect operating margins (Technical Difficulty).
Mark Hurd: And to your point about IPG's Enterprise sales force, we are already getting started. We have got them in place now. They have been in place for a period of time. But, you know, it takes roughly a year, 9, 12 months to get these guys really productive. So, we have ramped it up. There would be some pressure on them now to participate in helping the Company improve. So we are very optimistic about the segment and we expect good performance from them. But now is about the time, as you go into '08, that we start to see hopefully some contribution there.
Harry Blount: Great. I guess on the margin trend overall, though, the fact that you guys are tracking a fair amount ahead of where you guys set Analyst Day expectations, I was wondering if you guys had any thoughts on maybe sustaining a higher level going forward?
Mark Hurd: Well, it is a great reason to come to the next Analyst Day, Harry, because that is probably where we will revisit all of this. And obviously, we have internal plans, and I understand exactly the analytical point you're making. As I've said to you before and said to the group before, we have a lot more work to do at HP. We're anything but a finished product at this point. And we have got work to do and in some cases, it depends on the speed by which we make some of those plans that we have made come true. We sure have a lot more work to do, Harry. And so, we will [Technical Difficulty] Analyst Day, in that window, we will have to recalibrate our trajectory. And I'm sure Cathie and I will start describing that to you somewhere in that timeframe.
Harry Blount: Thanks.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Laura Conigliaro of Goldman.
Laura Conigliaro: Thank you. You talked about component tightness and components. And certainly, tightness looks like it is becoming more of an issue. Can you give us more color on which components are in fact the tightest? And as the largest customer, have you been able to line up what you need so far, especially given the fact that your inventories are tighter and do you expect that you might end up with any kind of problem given a seasonally strong October and, I guess, January quarter as well? The media is reporting this as a situation where component tightness might be bad enough that even a company as large as you might end up not being able to ship what you need to ship. How do you view that?
Mark Hurd: I view that, at least in our case, as probably not reporting that would be accurate. So, we feel good about our supply and, obviously, we got to try to secure supply. It could get to an issue; there is bound to be upside beyond that, but again, we feel pretty good about our position from a supply perspective. We lock in a lot of that supply before the quarter starts. To your questions on commodities, I mean, panels are tighter than they have been. Memory was a very advantaged position and obviously, the industry tries to realign itself from a capacity perspective. We feel good about processor supply. Hard disk drives are in supply. So we feel pretty good about our situation. I can't think of anything more specifically to give you in that area other than we feel like we can meet the guidance that we have described at least based on the current data that we have gotten.
Laura Conigliaro: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Maybe just to shift the focus; I appreciate the explanation that the DSO increase was driven by a strong finish to the quarter, but I think it is up year-over-year for the last six quarters, so, just wondering if there's any other explanation for the DSO increase such as change in mix or maybe an increase in aging of AR or the quarter simply just becoming more back-end-loaded than it used to be.
Cathie Lesjak: The first impact was what I mentioned, which was the strong finish to the quarter. But there is also the impact on… basically, there is a number of impacts to DSO. One is the linearity in the quarter, which we talked about. We also talked about… we also should say that acquisitions are a factor. And then the third one is, frankly, some of the terms that we are offering both to our direct and indirect customers. In certain situations where we think it is beneficial to HP, we have in fact offered extended terms or changed the cash discount that we offer in order to drive, for example, more channel business in high-margin space. We made some changes in the EMEA channel. All of those things are really putting pressure on DSO. Obviously, the strong finish to the quarter is one that may not repeat; the other ones will still be there.
Brian Alexander: So just to follow up, how should we be thinking about the range [inaudible].
Cathie Lesjak: I would think about the range in the 40- to 42-day space.
Brian Alexander: Okay, thank you very much.
Mark Hurd: When you look at the alignment of DSO to growth, I think when you look at the aggregation of the working capital metrics from payables to receivables to cash flow from operations integrated with the revenue growth on our inventory, I mean, that whole ecosystem of metrics looks pretty darn healthy to us. When you are growing at the rate that we are, you use working capital to drive that growth. So we feel pretty good about the aggregation of those metrics. So, we will leave it at that, I guess.
Brian Alexander: Thanks Mark.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley of FTN Research.
Bill Fearnley: Good afternoon. A quick question here on the IPG environment; could give your thoughts on IPG performance and what you're seeing here for the pricing and promotional environment? And are you happy with the unit growth and the balance between unit growth and the operating margins that you have here? So it is a question about the competitive environment and then how should we be thinking about unit growth and profitably here for the next couple quarters for IPG? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: Thanks Bill. They actually did better than we really had modeled. We had said at the last conference call kind of mid- to high-single digit unit growth because we are going through these really tough compares. And we felt that was a good thing. We saw the unit growth, though, in the high usage segments and we took it. I have heard, I don't know how to describe the kind of noise, that we are leading the pricing effort though we don't feel like we are. We feel like we are pricing rationally. And the only thing I can tell you is that with the work we are doing on the cost side, it may be that what seems irrational to somebody else seems rational to us. That is the only way I can explain it to you because it does not look like irrational pricing to us. And we are going after high usage segments that we think have strong aftermarket, as I am sure I know you know. So, we feel good about it. And then the operating margin thing, listen, we have put the Company in a position to perform better so that when opportunities like this unit growth, particularly in inkjet, show up that we can take advantage of them. So that is what we did and we feel really good about it. Remember, at the same time, IPG is making investments in an Enterprise sales force as well, so I think when you look at the IPG isolate story, it is a healthy one.
Cathie Lesjak: I think the only thing I would add to that is that we actually saw some ASP inclines in the consumer hardware space this quarter. We had revenue up 10% while units only grew 8%. And what we are seeing is that some of the consumers are moving up and moving away from single function into some of the All-in-One technology that we have, that is helping to increase average selling prices. So, in terms of aggressive pricing and competitiveness, for us, there’s really no change in our perception of that.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on whether supplies yield is consistent with your model and what you believe should be happening, given your unit sales. And let me tell you why I ask that. In the last 10 quarters, your hardware unit growth has been double digits, and despite that, supplies grew about 5% or 6% in constant currency this quarter. They decelerated for the second straight quarter despite easier compares, and your supplies inventory sounds like it crept up. So, maybe you didn’t sell through as much as you had thought. Can you explain, especially given this focus on higher yield units, whether you are getting the supplies yield that your model tells you? And how do we think about what 10% unit growth on a sustained basis should translate into sustainable supplies revenue growth?
Mark Hurd: Well, as always, you never disappoint me with these questions. I think you’re exactly right with what you are saying. The model is precisely built the way you describe. We look at it by segment, by unit, by region, and then we look at the attach and yield. And the model is… I will use this term analyst [ph] roughly right. That would be the way I would describe it. That is a heavy metric, as you know, so you have to compare what is typically three-quarters-back unit growth relative to the supplies mix. I won’t go into too much more detail on the algorithm, but I would say roughly right. Now, it depends on segment, it depends on channel, etc., but I would say net-net, out of everything you said, the model looks roughly right. And that’s where I will leave it.
Cathie Lesjak: Toni, the only other thing I would add is there is zero impact from the foreign exchange on supplies. So, that is not one of the dynamics that you need to model, but you definitely need to take into consideration the installed base, right. I mean some of these units are basically going into a base that already has HP printers. And we’re trying to maintain our franchise in some situations, in which case you’re not going to see tremendous supplies growth off of those units.
Mark Hurd: I think that, since Cathie gave you a little more detail, I will comment with the fact that you have to look at the speed and velocity of the installed base moving and then how the market share works relative to the velocity of the installed base. So, it isn’t a perfect model just to look at it the way you described. The FX, to Cathie’s point, you have got to take out of that. The model you’re working on is roughly right. And we would say it looks roughly right to us. I think that is the best way we can describe it.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Mark Hurd: We will take the next question please.
Operator: The next question will come from the line of Louis Miscioscia of Cowen.
Louis Miscioscia: Okay, thank you. Obviously, you guys have been rebuilding your data centers and I guess creating what you would define as a next-generation data center. Last week, Ann Livermore was at a conference and presented on this topic, and she identified six areas. One of them was IT systems or servers, power and cooling, virtualization… I think we’ve got a pretty good understanding of that, but three other ones were management, automation and security. Obviously you did the Opsware for that. Maybe you could just comment on how far along you think you are in delivering this solution, what customers are telling you about next-generation data center, and where you think you might be competitively?
Mark Hurd: I have only a few minutes left on this call, and I am sure Anne did this a heck of a lot more justice in the presentation that she was giving. But let me try to be as concise as I can be. Opsware helps a lot in the automation space. Management feels very good with the integration of OpenView and Mercury. Security, we’ve got various initiatives, but we still have more organic work to do to go build out our offerings. And I am not doing this justice at all with the description I’m giving you, but think of us as really maturing, we think, our management suite of capability. There’s always more areas we can do. Maturing in automation. What Opsware really gave us was not only server management and storage management pillars, but also gave us the workflow book that really moves across the pillars. So, you typically see network automation, storage automation, server automation, and then there is really this workflow that connects those capabilities. And Opsware is the world leader at doing that and has done a great job. It really gives us a pretty strong portfolio. I’m not going to tell you here we are done or it is a perfect game, so to speak, but the strength of where we are now versus where we were is significant. So, we feel good about where we are.
Louis Miscioscia: And just competitively real quick?
Mark Hurd: Well, competitively, we feel great. I mean, the problem is in this market, and we believe this whole category of management, morphs into one integrated kind of enterprise category, which is I am sure what Anne was describing to you. The problem is today that while we are the leader in the market, the leading market share is still rather low market share, because there is just a plethora of these tools that have populated the enterprise. So, this is really a market that needs leadership and consolidation. And, as we said before, we are volunteering to lead it and to bring it through. I don’t want you to think of us as just being acquisitive in this space, because we are now spending as part of these acquisitions, a pretty substantive amount of organic R&D that we believe now can bring out of our capabilities now more organic capabilities than we have in the past with not only the money we’re spending, but the skills that have come as a result of the Mercury acquisition, and what we hope will come and think will come as a result of the Opsware acquisition. So, we feel very good about it.
Louis Miscioscia: Okay, thank you. Very helpful.
Mark Hurd: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from the line of Richard Farmer of Merrill Lynch.
Richard Farmer: Thanks. Mark, I think one of the factors, if I heard it right, that you mentioned in the PC margins was increased attach. I’m just wondering if in general you could give us an update on the progress and the upsell in attach programs that you have in PCs and in the Industry Standard Servers… basically, how much margin effect do you think you have already achieved there, how much is in front of us? Essentially, what innings are we in the upsell and attach?
Mark Hurd: Well, we are better at it, Richard; we’re just not great at it. And we are doing better than we have. I think we’re doing better in the mix, not just in hardware attach, but also software attach. There’s a whole other issue around services attach. And when you look at the series of opportunities across those, we just have room to improve overall. We’re better at the hardware attach than the software attach and far better than we are at the services attach. So, I hate to give you an inning, because it is a very early inning kind of process for us to get the kind of ecosystem attach rates that I think are appropriate. And I don’t think that is, by the way, not a channel-centric kind of message either. We can do better even with our partners than we’re doing today. So, that is where I would leave that. We still have a lot of opportunity there and a lot of work to do.
Mark Hurd: Thank you Richard, we’ll take the next question.
Operator: Your next question will come from Rob Semple with Credit Suisse.
Rob Semple: Thanks guys. If I could just go back to demand for a second, from a vertical perspective, you talked about government, but were there any other verticals, either positive or negative, that stuck out in the quarter?
Mark Hurd: I just don’t think of any vertical that I have seen pop out of the analytics. I looked at them, but nothing. The answer must be no. I don’t know, Cathie, if you saw anything?
Cathie Lesjak: No.
Mark Hurd: No, sorry. I just don’t have anything to report on that front.
Rob Semple: No problem. And then, I guess, if I could just move from it to a geographic perspective. I know Europe was very strong on a constant currency basis. Did you see any pickup in any specific regions? Maybe you can comment a little bit on Germany, and we’ve heard about strength there from several of your competitors.
Mark Hurd: I would just reiterate what I said earlier. We had really good solid performance across all of our regions and our segments. And so, I would tell you that one of the positives was that we had good performance across all of our regions, and I would just leave it at that. It was a pretty broad-based performance. And again, that helps us because we are very global in nature, and there’s nothing there in any geography that I would point out as anything substantive. It was really solid across the board.
Jim Burns: We have time for one more question, operator, so let’s take one more.
Operator: Yes sir, your last questions will come from the line of Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.
Keith Bachman: Hi guys, thanks. Cathie or Mark, I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the buyback versus cash flow. For the last couple of quarters, your buyback has exceeded your free cash flow, and your net cash is hanging around $4 billion. How should we think about this relative to… is the $4 billion number a net cash you want to keep? How should we be thinking about the amount of buyback that you would be willing to undertake over the next couple quarters? Is it gated by the free cash flow? Are you willing to take on some debt? How should we be thinking about the metrics here?
Cathie Lesjak: So, our share repurchase program, the first priority is to offset dilution from employee benefit plans. And that is the minimum amount of share repurchase that we do in a quarter. And then we will look at market conditions, as well as opportunities within the company for cash to determine how much we would buy opportunistically. It’s really not constrained overly by cash flow. We believe that we have got plenty of cash. And I think we have been pretty public about the fact that we are willing to go down in cash and to do the right things for the company. We could talk a little bit, if you want to get a little bit more specific about the debt situation with the company. We have a financing business, and by far, the bulk of our debt goes to the financing business. So, what I would call the industrial company has very minor debt and plenty of opportunity to increase its debt positions.
Keith Bachman: Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Okay, alright, thanks for your questions. First of all, again, let me apologize for the telephonic issue that came up earlier. I hope it didn’t distract from the call, but let me try to summarize it by saying we had a strong quarter characterized by our strongest revenue growth since 2000, share gains in our key businesses, solid expense discipline, operating margin expansion, and significant share repurchases. And we did it while we made progress in improving our cost structure and investing in our strategic initiatives that we believe will strengthen Hewlett-Packard’s long-term competitive position. Given the solid fundamentals within our business, I am also pleased that we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the eighth consecutive quarter. I am pleased with our progress year-to-date and I am confident that we can continue to execute with discipline and post a strong close to the year. Thanks again.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect. Have a wonderful day.

===== 2007 Q2  (2007-05-17 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Hewlett-Packard 2007 second quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions). At this time, I will turn the presentation over to Jim Burns, Vice President of HP Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Jim Burns: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to welcome all of you to our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is our Chairman and CEO, Mark Hurd; and CFO, Cathie Lesjak. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call is being webcast live. The webcast and the second quarter earnings slide presentation, including non-GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on the HP Investor Relations web page under company information at www.hp.com. A replay also will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it's my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the second fiscal quarter. However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. I encourage you to read the risks described in HP's SEC reports, including but not limited to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2007 and its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. As in prior quarters, the financial information presented and discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflect estimates based on information available at this time. As such, these amounts could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-Q for the first quarter ended April 30, 2007. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items discussed at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including in-process R&D, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and net pension curtailment gains or losses. A presentation of GAAP financial information for the second quarter and fiscal year to date and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the tables accompanying today's earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations web page under Company Information at www.hp.com. Finally, and with a view to allowing time for questions from multiple firms, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Hurd: Thanks. All that just so we can tell you the results. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. HP delivered a strong second quarter. We had solid revenue growth, share gains in key businesses, expense discipline, margin expansion, record cash from operations and significant share buybacks. While we continued to invest in the long-term health of our various businesses, we drove further operating margin improvements across the company, with a year-over-year operating profit increase of 68% in the Personal Systems Group, 36% in the Technology Solutions Group and 12% in the Imaging and Printing Group. Financial highlights of the quarter include revenue growth of 13% year over year, or $3 billion to $25.5 billion. This represents our highest growth rate since 2000 and brings our year-to-date growth to $5.4 billion. Year-over-year operating margin expansion in all of our non-financing businesses, with Personal Systems margins of 4.8%, Imaging and Printing margins of 16.3%, Enterprise Storage and Server margins of 8.8%, HP Services margins of 11.1%, and HP Software margins of 8%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9%, up from 8% in the prior-year period; non-GAAP EPS of $0.70, up 30% when you exclude a $0.15 favorable tax item in the prior-year quarter; $4.2 billion of cash from operations; $4.2 billion of share repurchases. While posting these strong second quarter results, we continued to deploy our capital into longer-term strategic initiatives that will strengthen Hewlett-Packard's competitive positioning in the market. We are investing heavily in our real estate and data center consolidation programs to significantly improve our cost structure in future periods. We made a number of acquisitions that extend our existing technology solutions to new markets and to new customers. Turning now to the business segments and the second quarter results, Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 6% year over year to $7.2 billion, with supplies revenue growth up 10%, revenue and commercial hardware up 3% and consumer hardware revenue down 2%. Total printer hardware units grew 11% year over year, driven by commercial printer hardware unit growth of 21% and consumer printer hardware unit growth of 7%. Commercial hardware shipments continue to be led by our strong lineup of printer-based MFPs and color laser printers, which grew 40% and 19%, respectively. HP Indigo Press printed page volume continued to show solid growth, up 43% over the prior-year period. Supplies revenue grew 10%, which helped us drive IPG operating margins to 16.3%. This is the highest in ten quarters. While we are pleased with this bottom line performance and may achieve this level of margin from time to time, on balance we expect operating margins to be in the 14% to 15% range that we have guided as appropriate for this business. We'll continue to execute our strategy of leveraging the strength of our core printing business to aggressively invest in our growth initiatives, which we expect will extend our printing leadership into new markets. For example, in the second quarter we began shipping our Edgeline-based departmental MFPs and expanded our portfolio of business inkjet products, demonstrating our ability to scale our printing technology across multiple segments and categories. Moving now to Personal Systems, which had an outstanding quarter with excellent revenue growth, market share gains and strong margin performance, revenue growth 24% year over year to $8.7 billion with unit shipments up 30% and double-digit revenue and unit growth in every region. Consumer demand for our products remains strong, with consumer client revenue up 41% over the prior-year period, driven by notebooks as we continue to take advantage of the market shift towards mobility and the strength of our retail channels. Overall, notebook revenue grew 45% over the prior-year period, with double-digit growth in consumer and in commercial notebooks. Revenue in desktops grew 9% year over year, while revenue in workstations grew 19%. Our top line momentum continues to drive market share gains, and according to the preliminary first calendar quarter data, HP grew units 2.5 times the market rate, extended its leadership position and gained share across each region. While achieving these top line and shipment results, segment operating profit was a record $417 million or 4.8% of revenue, up from 3.6% in the prior-year period. On a year-over-year basis, PSG grew operating profit $169 million, the largest increase of any of our segments. We will continue to balance revenue growth and profitability by managing our costs, investing in market opportunities and leveraging our strength in notebooks, consumer and in emerging markets. Moving now to the Technology Solutions Group, enterprise, storage and servers grew revenue 8% year over year to $4.6 billion. Operating profit was $407 million or 8.8% of revenue, up from 7.5% in the prior-year period. We had a strong quarter in industry standard servers, with revenues up 17% year over year and share gains in every region. Within industry standard servers, we continue to show strength across server blades, with second-quarter revenue up 58% over the prior year. We expect these blade results will drive significant share gains for the quarter and extend our leadership in this important product category. In the future, we will also include Integrity and storage blades in our blade results. Revenue in storage grew 1% year over year. Weakness in tape on the high end was offset by ongoing strong performance of our flagship mid-range EVA external array business, which grew 10% versus the prior year, recording the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Based on preliminary data, we believe EVA will gain market share with these solid results. Business critical systems revenue decreased 6% year over year. We continue to see strong Integrity momentum, with revenue growth of 60% over the prior-year period. In the second quarter, Integrity represented 61% of business critical systems revenue, and that is up from 36% in the prior-year period. Integrity momentum was offset by ongoing declines in PA risk and Alpha. Across ESS, we continue to take leadership positions in the fastest-growing segments of the IT industry. We're building our operating model and aligning our resources to take advantage of these market shifts, which we believe define the future of IT and the next-generation data center. We had a solid quarter in HP Services, with revenue growth of 7% over the prior-year period to $4.1 billion. On a year-over-year basis, outsourcing services and consulting and integration grew 12% and 8% respectively. Revenue in technology services grew 3% year over year. HP Services delivered operating profit of $459 million or 11.1% of revenue, up 2.2 points year over year or an increase of $114 million. We achieved these results while continuing to make investments that we expect will improve our unit cost of delivery, increasing the standardization and automation of our service offerings and improving our competitive position. We are making good progress, but we have more investments to make and more work to do. HP Software revenue grew 58% over the prior-year period to $523 million, led by strong growth from the businesses acquired in our purchase of Mercury Interactive. On a year-over-year basis, HP OpenView grew 6%, excluding Mercury, and HP OpenCall declined 13%. HP Software reported an operating profit of $42 million or 8% of revenue, up from a profit of $3 million or 0.9% of revenue in the prior-year period. Second quarter results include integration charges from the Mercury acquisition, which offset solid operational performance. We have worked our way about through half the acquisition-related charges we expect to incur in fiscal year '07. HP Software performed ahead of plan, and I'm pleased with our efforts to date and the contribution of our integrated management team. HP Financial Services revenues was $550 million or up 6% year over year. Volume and net portfolio assets increased 8% and 6% over the prior-year period respectively. Operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.5% in Q2 of last year. The year-over-year margin decline reflects a decrease in net recoveries from bad debts relative to the prior-year period. We're encouraged with the growth in financing volume over the last several quarters and are focused on continuing volume momentum while balancing portfolio risk. I will conclude my segment comments by reiterating that we had a strong second quarter across the portfolio. As a company, we are executing on the plans we have laid out, delivering on our commitments to customers and investors and effectively balancing our growth, investments and cost reduction opportunities. With that said, I don't want to confuse you. We are still transforming; we are not close to being done. We have many cost reduction opportunities. Let me give you an example about one. We look at costs as everything between revenue and operating profit. As a result, we have a lot of costs. Our overhead costs, which is a piece of that cost, which includes IT, real estate and corporate support functions, will decline more from the beginning of fiscal year '07 through fiscal year '09 than they have from fiscal year '05 to fiscal year '06; decline more in dollars. As we continue to scale our businesses even more on a cost per unit basis, we have more work to do, but we're not confused about what we need to do. We will get this cost out and we will continue to focus on growth at the same time. With that, I will turn it over to Cathie.
Cathie Lesjak: Thanks, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. As Mark just indicated, Q2 was a strong quarter for Hewlett-Packard, and I'm pleased with the company's performance. Today I will walk you through our Q2 financial results, beginning with our view of the total company income statement. Revenue of $25.5 billion for the quarter was up 13% year over year or up 10% when adjusted for the effects of currency, which is within the guidance issued last week. On a contribution basis, Personal Systems contributed to the strong revenue growth. We also saw broad strength in our key focus areas, such as supplies within Imaging and Printing, HP Software, industry-standard servers within Enterprise Storage and Servers, and consulting and integration and outsourcing within HP Services. On a regional basis, revenue was up 11% in the Americas, up 14% in EMEA and up 16% in Asia Pacific. When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 11% in the Americas, 7% in EMEA and 13% in Asia Pacific. Second quarter gross margin was 24.5% of revenue or down 30 basis points from a year ago, reflecting the revenue strength in Personal Systems and the mix shift to our Integrity and ProLiant platforms in Enterprise Storage and Servers. This was partially offset by the revenue strength in HP Software. Sequentially, gross margin improved 80 basis points over the previous quarter, reflecting normal seasonal patterns in Imaging and Printing, favorable component pricing in Personal Systems, and lower service delivery costs in HP Services. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled $3.9 billion for the quarter or 15.5% of revenue, down 130 basis points from a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially. In dollars, operating expenses were up 4% year over year. However, adjusting for currency and acquisitions, expenses were down approximately 2% year over year. We continue to optimize our cost structure as we are reinvesting the savings from our cost reduction programs into our growth initiatives such as hiring of sales resources and demand generation. Sequentially, expenses were up 4% in dollars reflecting normal seasonality, which includes the implementation of our annual salary adjustment effective February 1. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2.3 billion or 9% of revenue, up $508 million year over year and up $143 million sequentially. Non-GAAP OI&E was $100 million or roughly $0.03 per share after tax, which is in line with what we have guided for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter, again at our guidance. Consistent with our updated guidance, second quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.70, up from $0.69 in the prior period or an increase of 30%, excluding the $0.15 one-time tax settlement gain in Q2 of '06. GAAP EPS was $0.65, which included $145 million or $0.05 per share in after-tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results. This includes amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring expenses primarily associated with the 2007 enhanced early retirement program, and a pension curtailment gain primarily associated with freezing our U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Now some comments on our cash balance and cash flow. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow achieved record levels in Q2. Cash flow from operations ended the quarter at $4.2 billion and free cash flow was $3.6 billion. Capital expenditures related to our investments in IT and real estate facilities, as well as growth in operating leases within our financing business. During the quarter, we also had a net cash outlay of $372 million for acquisitions. Q2 share repurchases totaled $4.2 billion. We repurchased $2.2 billion of shares in the open market and completed the prepaid variable share purchase program with the receipt of the final 6 million shares. In addition, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program for $1.8 billion. In total, approximately 100 million shares were acquired during the quarter. In Q2, we also paid $213 million for our normal dividend. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $12.3 billion, down from $14.1 billion last year and up sequentially from $10.4 billion. Net cash was $4 billion, down from $9 billion last year and $4.6 billion sequentially. Regarding capital expenditures, we continue to expect gross and net CapEx to trend above fiscal 2006 levels due to the increase in mix of operating leases in our financing business, the build out of our data centers and the deployment of capital to consolidate and upgrade our real estate facilities. Moving now to the balance sheet, HP-owned inventory came in at $7.3 billion, down $1.1 billion sequentially and up $510 million year over year. Inventory days of supply stand at 34 days, down five days sequentially and down two days from last year. We are comfortable with our owned inventory position. With regard to channel inventory, we exited the quarter in good shape. Personal Systems ended the quarter with approximately four weeks, which is flat versus the prior year and down one week sequentially as we fulfilled the retail demand of the Vista launch. Enterprise Storage and Servers ended the quarter at roughly four-and-a-half weeks, up about half a week year over year and flat sequentially. Imaging and Printing ended the quarter at roughly five-and-a-half weeks, up about half a week year over year and flat sequentially. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $11.6 billion, up $1.8 billion year over year and $1.2 billion sequentially. DSO now stands at 41 days due to our revenue linearity, up from 39 days in the prior-year period and up from 37 days sequentially. Next, property, plant and equipment was up $988 million year over year and $294 million sequentially at $7.3 billion. Gross CapEx was $758 million, up 45% year over year and up 6% sequentially. On a net basis, CapEx was $597 million, up 49% year over year and up 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in CapEx continues to reflect the incremental investments in IT, real estate facilities, as well as increases in financing assets. Net PP&E as a percentage of revenue now stands at 7.6% of revenue, up from 7.2% year over year and 7.5% sequentially. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 54 days, up from 53 both year over year and sequentially. I would like to now follow up on the announcement we made in our last quarterly earnings call with regards to our decision to both freeze the U.S. defined benefit pension plans and to offer an enhanced early retirement program to eligible U.S. employees. We have now implemented these programs and are pleased with the success. Approximately 3,000 U.S. employees participated in the program, of which roughly 20% were included from prior restructuring programs. These employees will leave HP by May 31. The results of these actions are reflected in our GAAP results, which include approximately $500 million of a curtailment gain, primarily as a result of freezing our U.S.-defined benefit programs, and approximately $400 million in restructuring charge. Keep in mind that the cash used to fund the enhanced early retirement program will be funded primarily from pension plan assets, and as such we do not expect any short-term impact on our cash flow from operations. Finally, a few comments on our outlook before we take your questions. We expect third quarter revenue to be approximately $23.7 billion to $23.9 billion, growing roughly 8% to 9% year over year, as we have previously guided. On a constant currency basis, revenue typically declines sequentially as Q3 is seasonally our weakest quarter. While the sequential decline implied by our guidance is greater than the historical 3% to 5%, we do not believe it is prudent to set investor expectations that our Personal Systems business can continue to grow 2.5 times the market rate, nor do we think it is appropriate to build a cost structure on that basis. For the fiscal year, we now anticipate revenue within the range of $100.5 billion to $100.9 billion, up from our prior guidance of $98 billion to $99 billion. Regarding earnings, there are many variables you need to keep in mind. With regard to the pension plan changes and our early retirement program, we have included approximately $0.01 to $0.02 benefit to non-GAAP earnings for the second half of FY07, consistent with the guidance we gave last quarter reflecting the timing of replacement and to a lesser extent, any labor cost arbitrage. Next, as part of our ongoing business operations, we expect to have workforce rebalancing in Q3 as we continue to optimize our cost structure. As previously communicated, these activities are considered part of normal operations and will be included in our business segment results. Our Q3 and Q4 guidance reflects approximately $0.02 per quarter in earnings per share associated with workforce rebalancing as we continue to adjust our cost structure. We expect Q3 non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.04 for the quarter and $0.07 for the remainder of the fiscal year, in line with our previous guidance. In addition, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% for Q3 2007 and full fiscal year 2007. Per our previous guidance at the December securities analyst meeting, we expect the tax rate in FY08 to increase to 21%. Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters. Of the $8 billion share repurchase authorization approved by the board on March 15, 2007, we have approximately $7 billion remaining. Share count will be impacted by the share price trends, option exercise patterns, common stock equivalents and of course, our repurchase activity. At this stage, we expect a modest decline to the remainder of fiscal 2007 from current levels. With this in mind, and recognizing our ongoing investments in demand generation, salesforce hiring, et cetera, we now expect 3Q07 non-GAAP earnings of approximately $0.64 to $0.65, representing 23% to 25% growth year over year, and full year FY '07 non-GAAP EPS of $2.75 to $2.77, up from our prior guidance of $2.50 to $2.55. With that, we will take your questions before Mark wraps up on the call with some closing comments.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch.
Richard Farmer: Mark and Cathie, I'd like to ask a question about your gross margin, trying to separate out the mix effects from the rate. In other words, if you separated out the effect of the mix shift in your revenues, especially towards PCs, and if we just looked at the aggregate apples-to-apples gross margin rate without that mix shift, can you comment on the trend in your gross margin in the quarter on that basis?
Cathie Lesjak: The gross margin year-over-year change is really all about mix. So there's not only the PC mix that puts a damper on gross margin, but also the trend that we have been seeing for some time now towards our ProLiant and our Integrity lines. There is a small offset to that, although it is only partial, and that is in the improved revenue position of HP Software. So it is really impossible to separate out mix effects to get an apples to apples, since the effect is almost entirely mix.
Richard Farmer: So should we presume then that apples to apples, segment by segment, there weren't any significant rate improvements or downward trends in gross margins?
Mark Hurd: Richard, you have got to be careful in HP Services because most of their costs creates a margin. So when you see an operating margin, most of that gets affected by gross margin, right? So that is the one place you would want to be cautious. In the product segments, which is I think what you are trying to get at, when you looked at below the reported segment level, generally speaking, it is just all mix that drives it. Like anything, Richard, there are stories within the story. At the HP level, it is a mix story, that is the driver.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs.
Laura Conigliaro: On the printer side, overall printer unit growth was the lowest it has been in the last four quarters at 11%, with a particularly steep drop on the consumer side. Why should we expect this to lead to slower supply growth in a couple of quarters?
Mark Hurd: We will see how it goes, Laura, because within supplies growth, it is dependent on not just the printer growth, but the mix of the printer growth, what segment it comes from, what geography it comes from, et cetera. I could give you a lot of complexity around it. I remember the days when 11% unit growth in a quarter in IPG was one of our hopes and dreams. So the fact that it wasn't 17% or some of the numbers you have seen in the past, 11% is very healthy, and we're sure it is going to be a share-taking kind of position, or we think it will be, based on the numbers we are looking at. So we will see what happens on the supplies connect and how it lays out, but again, I would say 11% is a pretty strong number for IPG.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers.
Harry Blount: A question also related to the printing segment. You clearly were above, as you indicated on your comments, target margins. Can you help us a little bit in understanding whether that upside was principally related to better than expected supplies growth versus your plan? Or was that related more to an underinvestment in some of the other targeted areas that you're looking at for future growth? And a little expansion on that would be great.
Mark Hurd: It is like anything, I can't say yes to any of your questions, because it is a combination of the above. We have certainly got an objective. As you know, we see a lot of revenue opportunity for us in some adjacent segments. As has been discussed previously, publicly, we think there are segment that we can do a better job from driving growth. We're investing into those segments as we go, and some of that is the timing of investments. Some of it isn't just whether it is supplies, but it is actually the mix that occurs within it, because we get some different numbers, depending whether it's toner, whether it's ink as we go, and some of it also comes into the mix, the hardware. It was just one of those situations where all the dials spun so that the operating margin came a little bit higher. My comments in my script were mainly around the fact that we're still going to pursue the investments that we think eventually drive significant growth for us, that we think can help the overall health of the business. So that dial we will get right. We will see, to Laura's earlier question, what happens with the unit growth and the mix as we go forward.
Cathie Lesjak: I think it is also important to realize that Q2 is typically our strongest quarter for our printing business. So we would expect that Q2 would come normally a little bit above our range for the year.
Mark Hurd: I'll give my last qualifying comment on top of that, that Q3 is usually our seasonally weakest quarter so I think that the combination of the two is probably a little bit there as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS.
Ben Reitzes: Really good cash flow in the quarter, higher than we expected. Can you talk about how you are tracking versus the goal you said in your analyst day of having free cash flow of about $7.9 billion or close to $3 a share in the year, and then how that flips back to your buyback decisions and/or acquisition decisions?
Mark Hurd: Listen, we feel good about certainly cash flow from operations. We set a goal early in the year and we talked about that. We have no change in our view of cash flow from operations on an annual basis. We will continue to look at the potential investments that we can make as it relates to buyback. We have tried to signal we are very positive on our shares, and so we were active in the market in Q2 as it related to share buybacks. We continue to evaluate everything from a capital strategy perspective against buying back shares versus making an acquisition that can lead to, we think, longer-term health of the business. So we think we have got a very sharp capital strategy that takes into consideration that we're making the best use of our cash. We expect to produce more cash, as we have described. We expect to use it against the capital strategy that we have laid out.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff: Nice quarter. Two things, I guess one thing, maybe if you don't answer that, there will be a second thing. Do you want to give any thought at this point to how '08 can shape up at this point? You've talked about the end of '07. In terms of any metrics, you've talked about growth metrics before, margin metrics, you talked about some of the expense savings. Can you give any thoughts on that? And if not, can you also give us a thought on what you would tend to do on the printer margins? Do you want to get back to 13% to 15%, and how do you expect to go about doing that?
Mark Hurd: I can't let your question go by about have I given any thought to '08, so just want to make sure. Look, have I given any thought to '08? I think about it, like, a lot. I think about '09 a lot, and I think about 2010 a lot. So do I think about all that a lot? Yes, I do. Am I giving guidance for '08, which I think is really what you're trying to get to? No. So those are two separate answers, but I wanted to make sure I bifurcated the questions. So yes, we think about everything we do in the context of not just short-term delivery, but actually long-term health and long-term delivery of performance for the company. In terms of where we are headed from an IPG perspective, we have given out more of a 14% to 15% range, and I think that is an appropriate place for the business to be. I think, to Cathie's point, you're going to see some seasonal differences in performance in the business, and some of it is going to relate to investment. Some of it is going to relate to our opportunity to take unit share as it relates to high-usage segments. Some of it is going to relate to where we are in emerging markets. Some of it is going to relate to our investments in adjacencies. I think, though, when you Rubik's Cube all that together, we think the operating margin targets that we gave are where we are going to land.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I had a question about software. I was trying to triangulate growth rates with what Mercury was doing as a stand-alone company. Your software grew about $190 million year over year and it sounds like the legacy software, OpenCall, OpenView, was about flat. Mercury was doing about $215 million to $225 million a quarter last year in the first half as its run rate. So the implication would be that the Mercury business actually shrunk. Can you try and reconcile the data points? Am I missing something? Was something reallocated in terms of how you account? How do we attribute what seemed to be pretty positive comments about your software business with those data points?
Mark Hurd: You are on some good points here and I was all geared up for a currency question, too so I'm disappointed because I've done extra homework. But that said, in software, you've got some points. First of all, Mercury was excellent, so Mercury was double-digit growth. Operating performance was what we expected. I won't go into more detail than that, or better. So Mercury was solid. OpenView growth was 6%, as we described I think in the script. In OpenCall, which was down 13%, we actually have some hardware that was in OpenCall that we now don't report in the software business. It is not material enough to get into as it relates to the segments, but on a number of the scale you are talking about, it can throw off the metrics a bit. To get to I think the core of your question, Mercury was strong. OpenView was 6% growth in the quarter and OpenCall was what it was.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan.
Bill Shope: Mark, as you know, there has been some discussion around Dell potentially entering the retail channel this year. Have you given any thought or can you give us some idea of how you think that could potentially have an impact on your retail shelf space as that occurs or potentially change the competitive landscape in general over time?
Mark Hurd: We think about all kinds of different things. We actually have a bunch of competitors that vie for that shelf space today. So obviously, they're going to make decisions that make the most sense for their company. We like our position. We like our relationship with those retailers and those channels. We think, given the situation we are in today, which is also, by the way, a very global set of relationships, a pretty important asset for us and so we'll work hard to do the best we can to be the best partner to those retailers that we can be.
Operator: Your next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.
Katie Huberty: Mark, you've bucked the trend of slower U.S. revenue growth that many of your competitors reported last month and then if we look at your DSOs, clearly pointing to a back-end-loaded quarter can we extrapolate that you experienced a pickup in U.S.-based spending in the month of April?
Mark Hurd: No, I would not extrapolate there. I understand how you got there by the numbers. I would say that U.S. enterprise behaved roughly as we expected. I wouldn't get exuberant about it, nor would I go the other way on it. It was roughly what we expected. The quarter behaved roughly as we expected as well in U.S. enterprise. So we did grow, as you described, in the U.S. and we feel good about it, but it behaved roughly as we expected.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Could you talk a little bit about the commodity pricing environment, and were there any strategic inventory buys during the quarter?
Mark Hurd: Well, we're always trying to make strategic buys. We're trying real hard to make less non-strategic buys, to be frank. But anyway, I would tell you, memory declined a bunch over the past several months. So we think the current prices of memory are unsustainable but they have gone down. There has been some pressure upwards on panels. I would say processor hard drives, stable, roughly where they have been. So that is the way I would described the commodity environment right now. I hope that helps.
Shannon Cross: Any thoughts about increasing your memory inventory, since the prices are so low right now and potentially hitting this current quarter?
Mark Hurd: Well, if there was, I probably wouldn't tell you Shannon, on this call. So it is just one of those things. We're always considering where we think commodity prices are, and to some degree trying to make a judgment on what the optimal time is to take what position. So we will continue to do that as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Alexander - Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: I just want to go back to the revenue guidance. For the second half of the year, it looks like you're guiding for decelerating revenue growth. You just did 10% in local currency. I think your guidance is more for 6%, which is still pretty reasonable growth for a company of your size. I just wanted to be clear. Is all of that deceleration really coming from more normalized growth in the PC business or are there other segments where you're expecting slower growth? And if you could just put that in terms of how you view the overall market environment for the back half of the year. Thanks.
Mark Hurd: I think you got it right on. It's just us going back to a more normalized view of that. Again, we're going into our weakest quarter seasonally. It is typically our weakest quarter in Q3. So there's a little bit of that as well that of course hits us. So there is no strategic deceleration, using the term you used, across our segments other than in PSG. When you've got that kind of growth, we don't think it's prudent to build a model based on 2.5 times market growth from a unit perspective as we go forward. So that is not what we are doing.
Operator: Your next question comes from Robert Semple - Credit Suisse.
Robert Semple: Mark, just some comments on the impact of Vista in the quarter. I know last quarter you expected a kind of limited uptake in terms of units. Obviously, they were stronger than expected. You also said systems configurations were expected to improve. What was the end result?
Mark Hurd: Roughly what we expected. I think we built some inventory at the end of Q1 because of what we thought would happen from Vista, and it did. You can see what happened back to our inventory levels after that. At the same time, we did not expect there to be a Vista moment per se that was going to create this big elbow from a demand perspective. We thought that it would be really helpful the way you described it, in terms of the overall ASP environment moving forward. I think it is still too early to tell whether that will be the case long run, but we have begun to see some help from Vista, and I think it was helpful to us in the quarter. But this is really a more of a longer-running opportunity we see as we go forward as opposed to something that was just unique for the quarter.
Robert Semple: Any surprises on corporate uptake of this or was it pretty limited?
Mark Hurd: No, the good news about this quarter in that respect was it behaved roughly as we expected. I think you can find any story you want to on Vista. I know companies that are planning to trade out their entire fleet of PCs in a short timeframe to upgrade to Vista. I also know others that are going to be very slow. So I think you can find right now any story you would like to find out there to rationalize your opinion or to support your opinion. I think we're just going to have to see how it goes, and that's why I think we were prudent in our modeling for Vista. I think it has kind of borne out that way. But clearly, it has been a benefit to us. So don't take me wrong, it has clearly been a benefit to us. We'll just have to see how it works going forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest.
Bill Fearnley: Two questions here in the enterprise space. You folks have talked about getting more aggressive in the data warehousing segment. Would you acquire another company in order to get significantly larger in that business? In addition, could you talk about what you're expecting here for enterprise demand trends for the back half of the year? You said it was what you would have expected in the quarter just reported, but how are you viewing U.S. enterprise, in particular for the back half and the data warehousing question as well? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: So we were trying to get to one question per guy, but I will take both. On the data warehousing one, I will try not to get too technical about it, but buying companies that provide either hardware, standard hardware, standard database stuff would not be of keen interest to us. I'll never say never to anything, but it is just not where we would be headed. We would be looking for more things in that arena, Knightsbridge, like we already acquired, or things that actually add value above the core technology stack. So that would be more where our focus is as opposed to areas that I think you were trying to imply. But we're not working on that. Again, never say never to anything, but that is not our focus. In the U.S. enterprise, I really don't have much to add to what I said earlier. The U.S. enterprise behaved roughly as we expected in Q2 and it looked steady to us from what we saw in Q1. So that would be roughly how I would describe U.S. enterprise.
Operator: Your next question comes from Lou Miscioscia - Cowen & Co.
Lou Miscioscia: Mark, you had commented this quarter and last quarter that you're still transforming the company but not close to being done. And then you had provided a couple thoughts on overhead. Could you possibly maybe reiterate those, provide maybe some more color and if possible, maybe some numbers wrapped around that? Because it sounded like you are suggesting that you've got significant runway through '09 to take costs out.
Mark Hurd: We had a lot of work to do, right? I will put my hand up as maybe one that has contributed to this, but I think that there's been a lot of people who thought that in 2005 we had a lot of rationalization to do of our cost structure. We announced a reduction in our workforce that was significant. I think there was a belief structure that this was some like one-time thing. Then, gee, everything is perfect, or they have run out of ideas… It is just far from what we're working on. We're working on a long-term model, but our scale and our cost structure has to give us an extreme competitive advantage. It may not over a few, but it should over many. So for us, our overhead costs, which again, I want to rationalize is just one piece of total costs. When we look at the cost envelope, I actually had one investor one time that said, let me look at your OpEx and how much can you remove from your OpEx to optimize your cost structure? My first reaction was, why would you do that? Most of our cost sits above the gross margin line, not in the OpEx line. So we look at every single line. And even a percentage of our overhead costs sits above the gross margin line because of the business structure that we are in, for example, HP Services. So in the overhead cost category, and I will go back to that, we will actually take out more costs from the beginning of fiscal year '07 through the end of the fiscal year '09 than we did through fiscal year '05 and fiscal year '06. And it is because some of the investments that Cathie described in her script take time to take hold. Not all of those are people. Much of that is a change in our D&A, our depreciation and amortization schedules. You have to line those up over a long-running period of time. We are making the investments, and I think we have done the right job to look at this strategically as opposed to tactically. I'm not sure we have done a great job of describing that to the investor base, and we're trying to get better at it. That is why I wanted to make the example that I used today. We just still have a lot of work to do, but we are confident we will get it done.
Operator: Your next question comes from David Wong - A.G. Edwards.
David Wong: Could you tell us a bit about your market share gains in PSG and x86 servers? Do you think these are coming from pricing or are there particular features that your customers want that are making them come to you?
Cathie Lesjak: I think the best way to articulate that is that we think we've got a really good product lineup. We certainly are not buying the share. We are focused on profitable growth, and we have clearly shown that at the PSG segment level, where our operating margins have expanded at the same time that we have grown that top line 24%. So it is really not pricing alone.
David Wong: Are you able to pinpoint any particular features, though, that you have that others don't seem to?
Mark Hurd: Again, it's different in different markets. You mentioned industry-standard servers and you separated that from PC products and notebook products and desktop products. There's a little different story in each one of those. But again, there's no question that our margins are healthy at the same time as we are gaining share and that happens in a lot. I think our unit costs are declining, so we are getting some advantage from unit costs that we have an opportunity to either take to the bottom line or invest in the marketplace. But if you look at our lineup of products, our designs are much improved and our ability to bring features, we think, to the market that customers want, inclusive of blades, which is helping our industry-standard server growth, these are all things that have come out of our R&D labs. R&D is at the center, we are a technology company. And the fact that we invest in R&D, we expect to be able to bring technology to market that people want to buy. We have a lot of pressure, to be very frank with you, on our R&D organization to show up with the best products in the industry. We believe there are some examples out there today in both product lines that you referenced of true innovations that customers value.
Operator: Your final question comes from Shaw Wu - American Technology Research.
Shaw Wu: I'm just wondering if you had any comments and thoughts on Michael Dell's comments that he plans to enter the distribution channel more aggressively over the next couple quarters? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: I don't have any comments on it. I think obviously that they need to do what is best for their business and what is best for their customers and decide. We need to do what is best for ours and best for our customers and that is what we're focused on, is doing the best we can for HP and HP's customers. That is what we will continue to focus on. Listen, thanks for the questions. I appreciate that. I am glad we got a lot of them in. Let me just try to summarize the call by saying I think Hewlett-Packard had a strong quarter, characterized by solid revenue growth, share gains in key businesses. We had good expense discipline, we had margin expansion, we had strong cash from operations and significant share repurchases. We did this while at the same time continuing the integration of Mercury, strengthening our business with the acquisition of Bristol, PolyServe, Tabblo and Bitfone, initiating our enhanced early retirement program and making further progress in investments on strategic initiatives that will strengthen Hewlett-Packard's long-term competitive positioning. Given the solid fundamentals within our business, I am pleased that we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the seventh consecutive quarter. We are off to a good start to the year and I'm confident that we can continue to execute with discipline and deliver a year of strong financial returns. Thank you very much.

===== 2007 Q1  (2007-02-21 15:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the first quarter 2007 Hewlett-Packard earnings conference call. My name is Melanie and I will be your coordinator for today. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Humphries, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is our Chairman and CEO, Mark Hurd; our CFO, Cathy Lesjak; and Jim Burns, who has recently been appointed Vice President of HP Investor Relations. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call is being webcast live. The webcast and the first quarter earnings slide presentation, including non-GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on the HP investor relations webpage under company information at hp.com. A replay will also be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the first quarter. However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. I encourage you to read the risks described in HP’s SEC reports, including but not limited to its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. As in prior quarters, the financial information presented and discussed in connection with this call, including tax related items, reflects estimates based on information available at this time. As such, these amounts could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HP’s Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2007. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items discussed at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including in-process R&D, amortization of good will and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and pension curtailment gains. A presentation of GAAP financial information for the first quarter and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the financial statements accompanying today’s earnings release, which is also available on the HP investor relations webpage at hp.com. Finally, I would like to remind you that at the beginning of each fiscal year, HP conducts a review of its financial reporting structure and determines whether changes should be made to align its financial reporting more closely to its business structure. As a result of HP’s fiscal 2007 review, HP has implemented certain fiscal 2007 organizational realignments. This year, we have two changes to report. These changes reflect only revenue shifts among the business units within the enterprise storage and server and HP services segments. There was no impact to segment level revenue and none of these changes impact HP’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings, or net earnings per share. To ensure you have full visibility and comparability, HP has reflected these realignments in prior periods on an as-if basis. Supplemental financial tables illustrating these changes for the past two fiscal years have been included in our earnings presentation and filed with the SEC. Finally, before passing you to Mark, and with a view to allocating time for questions from multiple firms, I would like to ask you to refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark V. Hurd: Thanks, Brian. First, let me start by thanking Brian for his great work as our head of Investor Relations. He has done a fabulous job during my tenure at Hewlett-Packard and we are going to miss him. I additionally want to make the comment that we have asked Jim Burns to take on this assignment which is I hope you will see a strong commitment on our part to placing senior leadership in the IR function. Our relationship with investors is very important to us and therefore the commitment we have made of a senior member of HP to that function to build on the momentum we have built under Brian’s leadership. With that, let me start and say I am pleased with the first quarter results that we had. We delivered solid revenue growth across all of our businesses and geographies. We gained share in our key businesses. We showed expense discipline and we expanded margins. In addition, we returned significant cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. While we continued to invest in the long-term health of our various businesses, we drove further operating margin improvements in our reportable segments, with a year-over-year operating profit increase of 41% in the personal systems group, 40% in the technology solutions group, and 10% in the imaging and printing group. As I have said before, cost discipline and revenue growth go hand-in-hand, and our share gains, solid top line growth and margin expansion reflect our ability to drive operating leverage and invest in growth by freeing up costs. Financial highlights of the quarter include revenue growth of 11% year over year, or $2.4 billion of growth, to $25.1 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of 23.7%, up from 23.2% in the prior year period. Continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in key businesses, with personal systems margins of 4.7%; imaging and printing margins of 15.3%; enterprise storage and server margins of 9.3%; HP services margins of 10.5%; and HP software margins of 8.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.6% -- that is up from 7.5% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP EPS of 65%. That represents growth of 35% year over year, and $2.7 billion of share repurchases in the quarter. I am particularly pleased that we have been able to post another quarter of solid results while continuing to make progress on longer term strategic initiatives that will strengthen HP’s competitive position in the market, including substantially completing our restructuring programs and continuing to work on other cost reduction opportunities, such as data center consolidation, service delivery cost optimization, and real estate management, and continuing to reinvest in growth initiatives, including sales force hiring and increased account coverage. With regard to management hiring, we added three new members to our executive council in recent months: Cathy Lesjak, who you are going to hear from in a little while, moved from Treasurer to Chief Financial Officer; John Flaxman moved from Controller to Chief Administrative Officer; and Michael Holston will join HP as our General Counsel on Thursday. We closed the acquisition of Mercury on November 6th. We remain focused on successfully integrating Mercury into our software portfolio and we are pleased with the early strength of Mercury’s revenue and margin performance. We also continued to build out our software and services capabilities with the acquisition of Knightsbridge Solutions and Bitphone Corporation, and in recent weeks we announced our intent to acquire Bristol Technologies. Knightsbridge, which is part of our consulting and integration business, strengthens our expertise in information management and business intelligence solutions. Bitphone develops software solutions for wireless mobile device management and enables us to accelerate our customers’ ability to manage their mobility infrastructure in a reliable, secure and cost-effective way. Bristol Technologies brings business transaction monitoring technologies to HP, further enhancing our leadership position in infrastructure management software. Now, let me turn to the business segments and the first quarter results. Imaging and Printing had a strong quarter. Revenue grew 7% year over year to $7 billion, with a surprise revenue growth of 11%. Revenue in commercial hardware up 2% and consumer hardware revenue flat. Over the past few years, we have focused on accelerating supplies growth by driving hardware shipments in areas of high supplies consumption. We had another strong quarter of unit shipments, with total printer hardware units up 18% year over year, driven by commercial printer hardware unit growth of 21% and consumer printer hardware unit growth of 16%. Momentum in key growth initiatives continues with all-in-one unit shipments up 27% year over year. Appliance photo printers were up 49%, color laser printer shipments up 35%, and printer-based MSP shipments up 8%. HP Indigo Press printed page volume grew 40% over the prior year period. We are confident that the strength of our unit shipment growth will extend our share leadership position in both the inkjet and laser markets. The consistent execution of our hardware placement strategy accelerated our supplies growth, which helped us drive margins to the high-end of our operating margin range, allowing us to invest in short-term pricing and promotional activities as well as growth initiatives. Going forward, you should expect to continue to see us build upon our strengths in our core printer business and extend our brand, technology leadership, and price performance advantage into adjacent markets and capture further page growth. Segment operating profit was $1.1 billion, or 15.3% of revenue, up from 14.9% in the prior year period. Moving now to personal systems, which had an excellent quarter, with strong revenue growth and market share gains and record operating margin. Revenue grew 17% year over year to $8.7 billion, with unit shipments up 19% and double-digit revenue and unit growth in every region. We had a strong holiday season, with consumer client revenue up 28% over the prior year period, driven by excellent unit shipment growth in consumer notebooks as we take advantage of a strong product lineup, improved branding, and advertising, as well as the strength of our retail channels. Overall notebook revenue growth was 40% over the prior year period, with double-digit growth in consumer and commercial notebooks. Revenue in desktops was down 1% year over year, while revenue in workstations grew 23%. We saw improved performance in our commercial client business, where revenue grew 8% over the prior year period, with strong growth in notebooks offsetting flat desktop revenue. As we continue to reduce our cost structure, we are better able to price and win commercial accounts profitably and regain account control with a view up to selling the entire Hewlett-Packard portfolio. Our top line momentum continues to drive market share gains and according to preliminary fourth quarter data, HP grew units three times the market rate and extended our leadership in notebooks, desktops, and total PCs in every region. I am particularly pleased that we posted these share gains while achieving record operating margins. During the first quarter, segment operating profit was $414 million, or 4.7% of revenue, up from 3.9% in the prior year period. You should expect us to continue to balance revenue growth and profitability by managing our costs, investing in market opportunities, and leveraging our strength in notebooks, consumer, and in emerging markets. Bear in mind that operating margins typically decline sequentially as we exit our seasonally strong back-to-school and holiday season. Let me move now to the technology solutions group. Enterprise storage and servers grew 5% year over year to $4.5 billion. Operating profit was $416 million, or 9.3% of revenue, up from 7.7% in the prior year period. We had a solid quarter in industry standard servers, with revenue up 10% year over year and share gains in every region. With industry standard servers, we continue to show strong momentum in server blades, with first quarter revenue up 45% over the prior year period, reflecting strong customer acceptance of our C-class blade offerings. Given our strong blade growth, we expect this will drive significant share gains in the quarter. Revenue in storage grew 3% year over year, and while I am pleased with the margin improvement we have seen in storage, we need to drive stronger top line results in the business. To this end, we will continue to invest in sales coverage and storage sales specialists, as well as aligning to enterprise vars and investing some of our margin strength back into demand generation. Weakness in tape and the high-end was offset by ongoing strong acceptance of our flagship mid-range EVA external array business, where revenue grew 18% year over year. Business critical systems revenue decreased 6% year over year. We did continue to see strong Integrity momentum, with revenue growth of 75% over the prior year period. In the first quarter, Integrity represented approximately 55% of business critical systems revenue, up from 30% in the prior year period. Integrity momentum was offset by ongoing declines in PA-RISC and Alpha. On an operating system HP-UX revenue was relatively flat year over year, offset by continued declines in Tru64, Unix, and NonStop systems. We can do better in this business and we are focused on driving improved revenue growth through better sales execution, account coverage and installed base leverage. We had a solid quarter in HP Services, with revenue growth of 5% over the prior year period, $3.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, outsourcing services and consulting and integration grew 11% and 10% respectively. Revenue in technology services grew 1% year over year. HP Services generated $414 million, or 10.5% of revenue, up 2.7 points year over year, despite pressure from start-up expenses related to new customer engagements. We continue to make progress on reducing our unit cost of service delivery and strengthening our portfolio of standardized and automated offerings. There is a lot of work ahead of us as we optimize delivery in support costs of our services model, but we have seen progress and we are focused on the opportunities ahead to enable us to drive improved revenue growth in the business. HP Software revenue grew 81% over the prior year period to $550 million, reflecting solid organic growth as well as the impact of our acquisition of Mercury Interactive. Revenue grew 7% year over year, excluding the effects of Mercury. On a year-over-year basis, HP OpenView grew 14% excluding Mercury, and OpenCall declined 6%. HP Software reported an operating profit of $47 million, or 8.5% of revenue, up from a profit of $9 million or 3% in the prior year period. First quarter segment results include integration charges and certain purchase accounting adjustments from the Mercury acquisition, which offset improved operational performance. Mercury finished its fiscal year with strong revenue growth and margin performance. We are focused on executing the integration and remain on track to post 18% to 22% operating margins in HP Software in FY08. You should see progress towards these targets as we get through the non-cash charges of the coming quarters. HP Financial Services revenue was $547 million, up 10% year over year. Volume in net portfolio assets increased 4% over the prior year period. Operating margin was 5.9%, which is down from 7.7% in Q1 of last year and 6.4% in Q4. The year-over-year margin decline reflects some asset write-downs and increased mix of operating lease from the prior year period. While we are encouraged with the growth in financing volume over the last several quarters, we know we have more work to do and we are focused on continuing volume momentum. I will conclude my segment comments by reiterating that we had a solid quarter across the entire portfolio. Over the past few years, we have made solid progress in our cost discipline and market competitiveness. As pleased as I am with this progress, we know there are opportunities for further improvement ahead. We are faced with a dynamic industry and we need to continue to execute with discipline to further strengthen HP’s competitive position in the market. I think the good news is that we are not confused about what we need to do. Before casting to Cathy, I wanted to address our decision to freeze our U.S. defined benefit plan for all employees currently accruing benefits. This is effective January 1, 2008. As a result of this decision, we will have a one-time pension curtailment gain of approximately $500 million. We will use these savings to offer impacted U.S. employees the option to participate in an enhanced early retirement program. The cost of the early retirement program will approximately equal the savings from the pension freeze, effectively returning the one-time retirement gain to many of the affected employees. Those employees who do not take advantage of the early retirement program will benefit from an increase in the company match of their 401K contributions. We believe these changes strike the right balance with respect to offering competitive employee benefits and optimizing our cost structure. Finally, benefits received by retirees or other active employees will not be affected by today’s announcement. With that, I would like to turn it over to Cathy who will address some of the financial assumptions behind the program during her prepared remarks.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a review of the total company income statement. Revenue of $25.1 billion for the quarter was up 11% year over year or up 7% when adjusted for the effects of currency. On a revenue growth contribution basis, growth was led by personal systems, imaging and printing, and HP Software, while industry standard servers posted strong growth within enterprise storage and servers, and outsourcing in consulting and integration grew strongly within HP Services. On a regional basis, revenue was up 6% in the Americas, up 14% in EMEA, and up 15% in Asia-Pacific. When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 6% in the Americas, 7% in EMEA, and 12% in Asia-Pacific. First quarter gross profit was $5.9 billion, or 23.7% of revenue, up from 23.2% a year ago, reflecting gross margin rate improvements in HP Software, imaging and printing, and services, and the mix improvement of HP Software. These rate and mix benefits were offset somewhat by a mix impact from the revenue strength in personal systems. Sequentially, gross margin declined from 24.3%, reflecting mix and rate impacts in personal systems and enterprise storage and servers, and rate impact in HP Services, offset by improvements in HP Software mix and gross margin rate improvements in imaging and printing. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled $3.8 billion for the quarter, or 15.1% of revenue, down from 15.7% a year ago and 15.3% sequentially. In dollars, operating expenses were up 6% year on year and up 1% sequentially. Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 4% year over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects volume growth, the effects of the Mercury acquisition, and investments in growth initiatives, such as the continued hiring of sales resources. These increases were offset by position eliminations or relocations as part of our restructuring program. Importantly, while we continue to shoe expense discipline, we continue to realign our costs by reducing our general and admin expense, and investing more in field selling costs and marketing. Non-GAAP operating profit was $2.2 billion, or 8.6% of revenue, up $457 million year over year and down $45 million sequentially. Non-GAAP OI&E was pretax income of $121 million, or roughly $0.03 per share after tax, at the lower end of the $0.03 to $0.04 per share we guided for the quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20% for the quarter, at our guidance. First quarter non-GAAP EPS was $0.65 from $0.48 in the prior year period, or a growth of 35%. GAAP EPS Was $0.55, which included $279 million, or $0.10 in after-tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results. The adjustments primarily relate to in-process R&D charges related to the Mercury acquisition and amortization of purchased intangibles. Moving now to the balance sheet, HP owned inventory came in at $8.4 billion, up $1.6 billion year over year and $630 million sequentially. Inventory days of supply stands at 39 days, up from 35 days last year and from 38 days sequentially. While we appropriately make inventory trade-offs, including some strategic buys to take advantage of deals and thereby reduce our overall bill of material costs, we need to do a better job in inventory management, and you should expect us to work on reducing inventory levels going forward. With regard to channel inventory, we exited the quarter in good shape. Personal systems ended the quarter with approximately five weeks, up about a week over the prior year period, reflecting some build of Vista-ready products at quarter end to enable us to fulfill retail demand upon Vista’s launch. We believe we are well-positioned to participate in Vista demand. Enterprise storage and servers ended the quarter at roughly 4.5 weeks, down about 0.5 week year over year. Imaging and printing ended the quarter at roughly 5.5 weeks, up about 0.5 week year over year, driven by supplies billed ahead of tax season. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $10.4 billion, up $1.7 billion year over year and down $470 million sequentially. DSO now stands at 37 days, up from 34 in the prior year period and down from 40 days sequentially. Next, property, plants and equipment was up $699 million year over year and $182 million sequentially at $7 billion. Gross CapEx was $718 million, up 68% year over year and down 26% sequentially. On a net basis, CapEx was $579 million, up 80% year over year and down 33% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in CapEx reflects incremental investments in IT, as well as increases in financing assets, which is consistent with our prior guidance. Net PP&E as a percentage of revenue now stands at 7.5% of revenue, up from 7.2% year over year and flat sequentially. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 53 days, up from 46 days year over year and down from 59 days sequentially. Next, some comments on our balance sheet and cash flow. As mentioned in our prior earnings call, there was a significant cash flow impact from the bonus pay-out in the first quarter related to the strong operating performance of the company in fiscal 2006. At the same time, when compared to prior year period, we saw weak working capital metrics in the quarter related to some increases in levels of inventory and builds in accounts receivable, given a stronger-than-expected month of January. Combined, this resulted in a cash flow from operations of negative $22 million for the quarter. As I said earlier, we will focus on improving inventory management and I am confident that cash flow will return to more appropriate levels in the second quarter. Free cash flow was negative $601 million, primarily reflecting weakness in operating cash flow and significant CapEx expenditure related to our investments in IT and real estate facilities. During the quarter, we had a net cash outlay of $4.5 billion for acquisitions, primarily related to the acquisition of Mercury. We purchased $2.3 billion in stock in the open market, or approximately 57 million shares. In addition, we received 13 million shares under the pre-paid variable share purchase program that we entered into early last year. So, a total of 70 million shares were acquired during the quarter. In addition, we paid $218 million in the quarter for our normal dividend. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $10.4 billion, from $12 billion last year and $16.4 billion sequentially. Net cash was $4.6 billion, down from $6.9 billion last January and $11.2 billion sequentially. With regard to the remainder of fiscal 2007, we expect gross and net capital expenditures to trend at or above fiscal 2006 levels as we continue to build out our data centers and deploy capital to consolidate and upgrade our real estate facilities, consistent with our guidance at our December security analysts meeting. I would now like to address our decision to freeze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and our decision to offer an enhanced early retirement program to eligible U.S. employees. The major elements of today’s announcement are as follows: the U.S. defined benefit pension plan will be frozen on January 1, 2008, for those employees currently participating in the program. Eligible employees may volunteer for an enhanced early retirement program. Employees who participate in the early retirement program will leave HP by May 31, 2007, and impacted employees not taking advantage of the early retirement program will move to an enhanced defined contribution program on January 1, 2008, with HP increasing its 401K match from 4% to 6%. Note pension benefits received by HP retirees and the benefits approved to date by current employees will not be affected by this announcement. We expect the changes to our U.S. pension plan will give us a curtailment gain of approximately $500 million. We expect approximately 3,000 employees to take advantage of the enhanced early retirement program and while results may differ as a result of employee participation rates, we expect the cost of the early retirement program to approximately equal the curtailment gain. If necessary, we can limit the participation rate to ensure the costs of the program are not significantly greater than the curtailment gain. We expect to replace the majority of those who take advantage of the early retirement program. We expect to report the impact of the curtailment gain and the cost of the early retirement program in our second quarter GAAP results. We feel that excluding these items from non-GAAP financials gives you better visibility into ongoing operations of the company and the financial impact of the program. I will address any savings that will impact our non-GAAP financials in my outlook commentary. Finally, in terms of cash flow impact, bear in mind that the cash consumption will be funded from the pension plan assets and as such, there will be no short-term impact on our cash flow from operations. Of course, we will continue to periodically evaluate our pension plan funding and while we are currently comfortable with the funded status of the program, we will continue to fund when appropriate. Now, a few comments on our outlook before we take your questions. We now expect second quarter revenue to be approximately $24.5 billion versus the current consensus estimates of $24.1 billion. Historically, revenue is roughly flat in constant currency from Q1 to Q2. However, given the strength of our consumer business in the holiday season, we expect our second quarter revenue to decline sequentially. For the full fiscal year, we now anticipate revenue of $98.0 billion to $99 billion, up from our prior guidance of $97 billion, reflecting our over-performance in the first quarter and the effects of currency. Regarding earnings, there are many variables to keep in mind. We expect some normal sequential price pressure on absolute costs and expenses as a result of Q1 to Q2 seasonality. Including the beneficial effects of the holiday season in Q1 baseline levels and the impact of our annual salary adjustment, which became effective February 1st. With regard to the pension plan changes and our early retirement program, there will be no impact to second quarter non-GAAP earnings given the timing of the action. However, we expect a $0.01 to $0.02 benefit to non-GAAP earnings in the second-half of fiscal 2007, reflecting primarily the timing of replacements and, to a less extent, any labor or cost arbitrage. Once the program becomes effective in January, 2008, we expect some ongoing savings from the changes to our defined benefit plan. However, bear in mind that the population of employees affected by the program is quite small, given the prior actions, and the savings will be partially offset by an increased 401K match for those who do not take the early retirement program. Nonetheless, we expect a $0.01 to $0.02 benefit to non-GAAP earnings in fiscal 2008. Given our weak cash flow in the first quarter and reduced cash balances, we now expect non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.10 for the remainder of the year, or $0.13 for the full year versus our prior guidance of $0.03 to $0.04 per quarter. We expect Q2 non-GAAP OI&E of $0.03, a little bit below your models. Regarding tax, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% for quarter two ’07 and full year fiscal 2007, though we expect fiscal ’08 to be 21% per our previous guidance at the December security analysts meeting. Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarter. The effect on share count will be impacted by the share price trends, option exercise patterns, and common stock equivalents. However, at this stage, we continue to expect a modest decline through the remainder of fiscal 2007. With this in mind, and recognizing our ongoing investments in demand generation, sales force hiring, et cetera, we now expect Q207 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.63 to $0.64, and full-year fiscal 2007 non-GAAP EPS of $2.60 to $2.65, up from our prior guidance of $2.48 to $2.53, and versus current consensus estimates of $2.57. With that, we will take your questions before Mark wraps up the call with some closing comments.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with UBS. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes: Cathy, could you give a little more detail on inventory? Was there any particular component or what not that happened to raise the inventory number and/or any impact from Vista? Then, just a little more detail on what you are going to do to lower inventory and have the cash flow snap back. Thanks a lot.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Thank you. In terms of inventory, the increase in inventory was pretty much across the board. There was not any one single business that was impacted by it, nor was there one specific reason for it. Some of the increases were due to what we discussed last quarter related to putting more inventory on boats from China in order to get cost of sales reductions, and so we definitely saw some increase in PSG as a result of that. We also had some increase in PSG for Chinese New Year, and while some of you might smile at that, the reality is we source a lot of product from China and when they go on vacation for Chinese New Year, we did not want to be without product, so we do have some inventory build as a result of that. We also had some inventory build in supplies and hardware in preparation for the tax season in IPG. Plus, we saw an up-tick in SAB 101 inventory. So in terms of what we are going to do, what I would like to do and will be doing is basically scrubbing these inventory numbers going forward to make sure that we have absolutely the minimum amount of inventory that we need so that we are utilizing the capital to our best advantage. That is not to say that everything will come down. There are still good reasons to make trade-offs, like I mentioned, around the PSG boat inventory, and so we will continue to do those types of things as well.
Mark V. Hurd: Ben, let me make sure you are clear before you get off the phone: we are all over this thing. At the same time, we are trying to look at an aggregate P&L view so that we get an optimal answer in terms of the performance of the business, and we are looking at return on invested capital on everything we do. I think when you look at the rate of inventory relative to the margin drop, we feel pretty good about that dimension. Secondly, we feel pretty good about the freshness of the inventory that we have relative to Cathy’s points. You get the Chinese New Year effect, which I understand the smile point that Cathy made, but at the same time, we wanted to make sure we had inventory as we went into the coming quarter. From a cash flow perspective, our big issues were we had an incremental bonus that we paid that we think was appropriate relative to the performance of the business in 2006, and the issue that you are describing. But I want to make sure you do not have any confusion: we’re all over this thing.
Ben Reitzes: And you expect a big snap back in cash flow?
Mark V. Hurd: Sure do. We sure do.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Mark.
Brian Humphries: Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Laura Conigliaro with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.
Laura Conigliaro: Yes, thank you. Last quarter you indicated that you really didn’t know what the impact of Vista was likely to be. What would you say to that now? Your enormous number of PCs driven by notebooks obviously coincides with the holidays and a Vista launch. How should we be thinking about your PC potential in a seasonally slower quarter?
Mark V. Hurd: Laura, I will do my best but very bluntly, Vista will have an impact in Q2, and we are talking mainly about Q1 and I do not want to give you much about how the quarter started, other than to say, as we have said before, we were not forecasting any Vista moment, so to speak, in the context of how we were seeing this thing roll out. I think at this point, while we have a couple of weeks of data, I do not have anything enough to give you any color, and I would be afraid to do that in the context of such a short period of time. Like we said before, we are optimistic. We think it drives a more robust configuration in terms of what gets sold but we have not forecasted any big change in terms of trajectory as part of the next couple of quarters.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Laura, we would just reiterate that our FY08 financial model called for 4% to 6% revenue growth per PSG and we are still very comfortable with that.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Laura. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rich Gardner with Citigroup. Go ahead.
Rich Gardner: Okay, thank you. Cathy, I wanted to go back to your guidance for the second quarter. As you said, and gave several reasons for, you are guiding below normal seasonality for the quarter but it does sound like the channel inventories are pretty lean and we certainly have seen a big pickup in sell-through per the NPD data after the launch of Vista in early February. I am also a little bit unclear why EPS would be down sequentially, given that if revenue is down, that means you will see a mix shift toward supplies, which would tend to push up the margins and the EPS sequentially.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Let’s tackle the revenue first. Our robust holiday season in PSG makes us think that in fact we will come off of that high in Q2, which is per my comments, unusual but so is the tremendous pick-up that we got around the holiday season for PSG. That is why we are guiding down a bit, relative to seasonality. On the guidance in terms of EPS, it is true that IPG margins pick up Q1 to Q2, but we also have to deal with the effect of lower revenue than what we typically see when we go from Q1 to Q2.
Mark V. Hurd: Rich, to your point, we feel pretty good about channel inventory levels. We feel good about how we are positioned. We have raised our guidance and we feel good about our position. We hope we do better but to be very blunt, that is where we see things falling at the current time. Just to be clear, we will not get any impact of this pension curtailment in the quarter either. That is going to play out over the quarter, so I think it really is the revenue mix story that comes into play. We will see how it turns out.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Rich. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead.
Bill Shope: Great, thanks. Can you comment on component pricing and availability during the quarter, and potentially your outlook for some of the key components? Also, in line with that question, do you see any risk, given your inventory levels, that you may get hit with some of these, or the strategic inventory purchases may actually hit your margins in the second quarter, given the component price declines we have seen in the past few weeks?
Mark V. Hurd: We feel pretty good about the freshness of the inventory, Bill, again. We feel pretty good about it so I think the answer to that question would be no, not really. We are seeing memory loosen up a little bit. We went through a horrible time with memory for almost all of ’06. It was a difficult thing for us at back to school and even through the Christmas season, so memory has freed up. We are concerned though that memory is going to go up and down in terms of availability during that timeframe. Processors were stable during the quarter, so nothing significant there. Hard drives were stable. There could be some tightness with hard drives as we go up in the first calendar year quarter of ’07, because there are some technology transitions in there. We expect some modest price erosion in panels but again, there is some supply tightness in panels too, so -- memory has been a little bit of a change in that we are able to get a little more than we were. In the other spots, I would say roughly stable and a bit of concern.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Bill. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch. Go ahead.
Richard Farmer: Cathy and Mark, I just want to make sure I understand the curtailment and more broadly, the financial effect of the headcount reductions, both from the curtailment but also the anniversary benefit from your prior restructuring. On the pension curtailment, I understand you expect roughly the $500 million gain to be offset by the expense of the employees leaving, but wouldn’t that put the run-rate of the savings significantly higher than the $0.01 to $0.02 benefit I think I heard you describe? And then, on the restructuring anniversary, I understand you are done with the actions but you are still going to be comping on much higher cost quarters from last year, so shouldn’t we think of that as being roughly $700 million of gross savings from that original plan in 2007 over 2006 in terms of operating income? Combined, what I am asking is: what is the total effect year over year of the headcount changes?
Mark V. Hurd: First, we are going to send the investor relations discipline police after you for breaking the multiple questions in a conference call rule, but given that, let me try to first tackle the new announcement that we have. First, do not assume that these jobs are eliminated. In many cases, when you establish one of these, Richard, you cannot pick and choose where you offer the program. You have to offer it in a broad way. So we will have people in multiple functions across all of HP that may take advantage of this program. Many of those jobs will be replaced, so there will be a replacement factor. Will those jobs be replaced with a potential cost savings? Potentially. What we have tried to do is model the timing of the replacement and the different cost structure of the replacement relative to the current situation that we have, and that is what you see modeled out. So I think to your point, this is a one-time in and out from a gain perspective and then payment from the EER. The cash flow from this, of course, as Cathy mentioned, comes directly from the pension plan itself, so it has no cash flow implication. The ongoing savings relates to the fact of if you think of the majority of those jobs being replaced, what exits versus what comes in. That is what we have tried to model and that is what we have given you. As it relates to the cost structure in ’07 versus ’06, yes, we think we have a better cost structure in ’07 versus ’06. What you see happening in our financials though, even though you see good cost discipline -- I hope you think that, because that is what we are trying to do -- we are shifting our spending out of G&A categories and to some degree, you are seeing that investment going into more outbound categories to create more demand, and it is beginning to have an impact for us. It is not all just netting. There is some better situation from a cost structure perspective than we had in ‘06. I concur with your points there, but there is also some offset as it relates to reinvestment back into demand creation.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Richard. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.
Katie Huberty: Thanks. Mark, how are you thinking about printer margins, given you are above your target range for the past two quarters and can clearly afford to invest even more into new products and pricing going forward?
Mark V. Hurd: Katie, you are right. We think about this a lot. We are trying to make sure we are appropriately looking at this unit growth. For us, unit growth is really key in the consumer segment and so we are trying to make sure we are going after the high usage segments in the appropriate markets. One thing to be cautious of that our emerging markets supplies connect is a little different than our mature markets supplies connect with counterfeiting and fraud and some of the things that go into some of those markets, so we need to factor that in. Secondly, we have some very important adjacencies, like the enterprise market, that we are trying to invest in and we are trying to do all of that at the same time that we deal with the short-term and optimize those margins. I really think the team in IPG has done a pretty nice job of focusing on its cost structure, focusing on the short-term unit growth and then the supplies connect in relationship to that, and then at the same time, investing in some of these adjacent markets that we think makes sense. I think right now, we think of our range being roughly right and continue to stay in that range, but to your point, if we have opportunities, we will accelerate our ability to get after some of these incremental opportunities.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Katie. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tony Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Go ahead.
Tony Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I have a question about gross margin percentage. Over the last two quarters, it has gone down about 100 basis points sequentially on a GAAP basis. I think you had commented that Mercury would add about 50 basis points to gross margins, so it has actually gone down 150 basis points over the last two quarters. Mix alone certainly does not explain it. PCs are only 3% higher as a percentage of total during that time period so I do not think that is the answer. The question is what is really driving the I think you called them rate changes, in gross margin? Are these conscious steps for you to drive revenue, or is the competitive environment getting tougher?
Mark V. Hurd: Tony, we feel pretty good about our gross margin rate. We are up 50 basis points year over year in our performance. We have a strong PSG component, to your point, which is a big driver. I know the numbers pretty well and that is the majority of the driver. Now, you have some compares you have to be careful on the supplies connect, which get back to a different mix issue as it relates to the Q4 sequential compare. But overall, when you look at it differently than at the company level, segment by segment and break it down into those various pieces, the continuity of gross margin rate I would say roughly right, no material change in gross margin rate on a segment-by-segment basis.
Catherine A. Lesjak: One of the rates benefits also, Tony, that we are getting is that we really got an up-tick in supplies in the mix. So in Q4, we had a relatively weak supplies position and in Q1, it is much --
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Tony. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers. Go ahead.
Harry Blount: Thanks. Questions coming back to the cash flow. As I look at the cash flow statement, I think a lot of the things are pretty apparent based on both the outline of what you guys provided but one of the categories I am a little unclear of was the use of cash in the amount of $1.5 billion of other assets and liabilities. I just would love to get a better sense of that and incorporate that within the sense of what kind of snap back we should expect in cash flow over the next several quarters.
Catherine A. Lesjak: That $1.488 billion was made up of a number of items. Certainly it includes our bonus payments but it also includes that payables and receivables that frankly went against us this quarter, as well as some vendor rebates that were [inaudible] that were up quarter over quarter.
Harry Blount: So as we take a look at that number then, what you are saying is a lot of those are one-time items that we should not be recurring in future quarters, other than the bonus payment periodically?
Catherine A. Lesjak: Again, those other items, the VAT receivables and payables as well as the vendor rebates receivables, they go up and down with the business so it is very hard to predict those. It really depends on the cut-off on a particular quarter, and then the bonus payment is once a year.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Harry. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Banc of America. Go ahead.
Keith Bachman: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the gross margin comment and Mark, just get your perspective, or Cathy, as we look out over the next few quarters in the context of the guidance you have given, how would you anticipate the gross margin trends on a year over year basis? Are they going to remain roughly flattish? You have some tougher comps coming up with April and July of last year, where you had pretty good supplies numbers. How should we be thinking about the gross margin trend as we look out in say the next three quarters? Cathy, you kind of faded out on the last answer. I am not sure what happened there, vis-à-vis the mic.
Catherine A. Lesjak: Sorry about that.
Mark V. Hurd: Let me make sure on the last answer, I think it was pretty important. The bonus payment is a non-recurring payment from Q1, Q2, Q3, so it is a true-up, so to speak. At the end of Q4 it is netted out of our income statement but the cash hits all at one time. Just back on that too, we had modeled this pretty close to what had transpired from a cash flow perspective going into Q1. We were a little light because of the inventory positions we took but we felt pretty good about that as well. On gross margin, Keith, I think your point is right. This is all about mix. There is no segment change of consequence in absolute gross margin. Now, to be very clear with you though, Keith, it depends on what happens in the market. I do not want to predict for you how the market will behave as we go into the next future quarters. We certainly improved our position to the point that we have more flexibility to do various things in the market, as you can see by the numbers we are producing so I cannot predict for you how that pricing behavior and that market behavior will occur. But given current course and speed, no extraordinary changes, we are not seeing any change in gross margin behavior by segment, so it will come down to a mix issue and to what those mix numbers look like in the quarters ahead.
Catherine A. Lesjak: I would just add that Q2 of course with the supplies percentage improving, which is normal seasonality for us, you would see some increase in gross margin in Q2.
Brian Humphries: Thanks. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns. Go ahead.
Andrew Neff: My question is just on the acquisition strategy. You had the acquisition obviously of Mercury. Could you give us a sense about your thoughts, Mark, as you look forward? Are you interested in doing more acquisitions of this size? Can you talk about what area it would be in and what criteria? Just your general thoughts; how should we think about that?
Mark V. Hurd: I think we have done some acquisitions, Andy, as you know, but we are pretty aligned around this strategy that says we are not going to do anything that is not strategically sensible, that financially makes sense, and that we can operate the acquired property effectively. While I know there are rumors that go on in the marketplace which occur, we take a pretty disciplined view towards this stuff. We do look at most of the properties that are out there like anybody does, but we are going to be very disciplined about what we do and it is going to have to make sense across those three criteria. Again, I think we will never say never to anything, but you should expect us to do pretty much more of the same, and the acquisition of the Mercury class to be more a rarity as opposed to commonplace kind of activity.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Andy. We’ll take the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Go ahead.
Shannon Cross: Good afternoon. Just a quick question on what is going on with Kodak and its inkjet strategy. Mark, I am just curious as to your thoughts on their idea of taking up hardware prices and down the ink prices in order to be more competitive and gain share.
Mark V. Hurd: It is an interesting concept. We hope hardware prices go up. That would be great. We would sign up for that and be glad to participate in that. Again, I think we like our position, Shannon. We have a very strong position. You have seen it strengthen over the past quarters. We think we are in a great position from an innovation and technology perspective, from a channel of distribution perspective, and we are going to continue to be very focused on our cost structure, so again, back to the earlier questions that we have had, we have flexibility to participate in any way that makes sense and is appropriate in the marketplace. That said, competition is great. I hope it will make us even sharper.
Shannon Cross: But no plans to follow them down in pricing in the near-term though?
Mark V. Hurd: No, and I think in the end, we will see what happens, but we really like our value proposition. We like our position and we want to expand on that. Of course, there are other competitors out there other than the guys you mentioned, so we are also focused on them because there are some strong competitors in that market. We want to make sure we are doing our job.
Brian Humphries: Okay, thanks, Shannon. Next question, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest. Go ahead.
William Fearnley: Yes, thanks, just one other follow-up, if I could, on the inventory question. Will this require additional promo spending, MDF investments or price cuts to move the inventory through? When should we be looking for the improvement? Do you see dramatic improvement in the second quarter or is this a second quarter to third quarter phenomenon? Thanks.
Mark V. Hurd: No to your first question, Bill, in terms of all that. We feel good about our channel inventory, the freshness of it and feel good about what we did from a components acquisition perspective. We look to improve our cash flow in Q2, so we are looking for pretty immediate position here. We feel good about what we have done.
Brian Humphries: Okay, thanks, Bill. Next question.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Cowen. Go ahead.
Louis Miscioscia: Great, thank you. It definitely seems like you have gained significant share in certain areas, but maybe you could give us a couple of comments on how you are viewing tech demand, both in the first-half and the second-half. Maybe if I could sneak another one in there: do you see virtualization possibly affecting server business in the second-half? Thank you.
Mark V. Hurd: I guess I would say overall, we see demand steady. The issue always is there are stories within the story. We felt much better about the situation in Europe, to be very blunt with you. We saw some good strength across a number of different dimensions across a number of different markets in Europe in the quarter, which was encouraging. We continued to watch the U.S. consumer, and I think I said that for several quarters. The consumer has been strong and we continue to watch that. I cannot give you anything more specific than that. The U.S. enterprise is a place that we have always had some concerns. I do not think that is a virtualization issue so much as it just is that people are being prudent with their spending. Now, at the same time as you have seen that, we are clearly gaining share so we sometimes have to modulate what is the difference between our share gain and the macro demand environment. We feel very good about our position but we continue to monitor it. I gave you a lot of data there other than to say -- overall, I would say steady but there clearly are stories within the story.
Brian Humphries: Okay, we will take two more questions, please.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Renouard with Robert Baird.
Dan Renouard: Just on the enterprise side, Mark, you alluded to putting more resources to work in the field, and of course that is an easier-said-than-done kind of proposition. Maybe you could just give us a couple of tangible examples of some things that you have done where you have seen some success that you expect will help pay off over the next several quarters or years.
Mark V. Hurd: We have done some hiring so clearly we have accomplished much of the hiring that we indicated that we would last year. To be very open with you on this thing, we just do not cover enough accounts. While we are covering more than we were, we do not cover enough. I am a strong believer that there is more demand for Hewlett-Packard in the marketplace than we are currently getting and we do not cover enough accounts. That is part of the reason that we have to get our cost structure right and we have to get it right as fast as we can so that we can get to the market and compete for more business. I believe there is an opportunity for us. Now, to your point, we cannot do this in 15 minutes. It takes time for us to source. We have to hire great people and then we have to train them and then we have to get them assimilated to HP and get them into territories where they can go out and compete. At the same time, we need help from our partners because they can help us close the gap by covering more accounts as well. So we are doing a lot of work here, Dan, on the total available market because we think there is an opportunity for us that plays out in later years with us being able to capture more share.
Brian Humphries: We will take one final question.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.
Chris Whitmore: Thanks. To follow up on that last question, I was hoping to get more color on the weakness in high-end servers and high-end storage, probably the one blemish from a market share standpoint. What is the underlying driver of that share loss? Related to that, can you speak to the sustainability of margin improvement in that segment, given the mix down market? Thanks.
Mark V. Hurd: I think storage is a more complicated story, so I will start with that. Our EVA line, which is our flagship mid-range line, grew 18%, so that was good performance for us and we felt good about EVA in the quarter. That was pretty well true across regions and segments, so a very strong performance there. We saw poor performance in tape and tape is the older part of the business. It is still a substantive part of our business and tape declined faster than we would like. It is kind of a mix story that you have to get into the piece parts and understand. We feel very good about EVA. We think we could do better even though in EVA and some other parts of the core storage business. In the business critical line, which is the higher end stuff, I actually think that is a different story than storage. There, we just had a weak quarter. I cannot be any clearer with you. I am just disappointed and we can do better than we are doing. Part of it is aligning our demand better and we had some deals that slipped -- I could tell you a whole set of long, sad stories but I do not think you would have time, nor care. We just need to do better. That is about as simple as I can make it. With that, we are going to close up and listen, first, thanks for your questions. I know we had a lot of data to put out today and I can imagine it is tough as we raise our guidance and do this pension curtailment, et cetera, et cetera. Let me try to summarize today’s call by saying that we had a solid quarter, characterized by solid revenue growth, share gains in key businesses, expense discipline and margin expansion. In addition, as we mentioned, we had $2.7 billion of share repurchase. We did this while continuing to make progress in our cost structure by substantially completing our restructuring program, executing the integration of Mercury and continuing to strengthen our solution portfolio with additional acquisitions, and making further progress in our strategic initiatives that will strengthen HP's long-term competitive positioning. Given the solid fundamentals of our business, I am pleased that we are increasing non-GAAP EPS guidance for the sixth consecutive quarter. I want to make sure you are not confused though; we know we have a lot of work ahead of us and I have said before: we are transforming the company, we are not transformed. We need to continue to execute against our cost reduction programs. We need to realign our costs to invest more in marketing and field selling costs. We need to invest in great technology and bring compelling solutions to the market that we service better than anybody else on the planet. We need to do a better job on inventory management and return with the kind of solid cash flow that you should expect in the second quarter. So all in all, we have a lot of work to do but a lot of opportunities as well. I think it is a solid start to the year. I am confident that we can continue to execute with discipline and deliver a year of strong financial returns. Thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today’s conference. That does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2006 Q4  (2006-11-17 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2006 Hewlett-Packard earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Brian Humphries, Vice President, Investor Relations.  Please proceed, sir.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Colby and good afternoon, everyone.  I would like to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.  Joining me today is our Chairperson and CEO, Mark Hurd; and CFO, Bob Wayman. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that is call is being webcast live.  The webcast and the fourth quarter's earnings slide presentation, including non-GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on the HP Investor Relations page under Company Information on HP.com.  A replay will also be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the fourth quarter and fiscal year end.  However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual future results may vary materially.  I encourage you to read the risk factors described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005; the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2006; as well as other SEC reports filed after that date. As in prior years, the financial information presented and discussed in connection with this call, including tax-related items, reflects estimates based on the information available at this time.  As such, these amounts can differ materially from the amount ultimately reported in HP's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items discussed at a company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including: in-process R&D, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges, pension curtailment gains and net investment gains or losses. The  presentation of GAAP financial information for the fourth quarter and fiscal year end and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations page under Company Information at HP.com. Finally and with a view to allowing time for questions from multiple firms, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Hurd: Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.  Hewlett-Packard closed the year with a strong fourth quarter, driven by solid revenue growth across all our businesses and geographies, share gains in key businesses, expense discipline, margin expansion and record quarterly cash flow from operations. We saw significant operating margin improvements in our reportable segments with a year-over-year operating profit increase of 68% in the personal systems group, 42% in the technology solutions group and 21% in the image and printing group.  All of this resulted in our most balanced segment profitability performance in many years, with the technology solutions group delivering a similar fourth quarter dollar profit contribution as the imaging and printing group. Financial highlights of the quarter include: revenue growth of 7% year over year, or $1.6 billion to $24.6 billion; non-GAAP gross margin of 24.3%, up from 23.5% in the prior year period; continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in key businesses, with personal systems margins of 4.3%, imaging and printing margins of 14.8%, enterprise storage and server margins of 10.7%, HP Services margins of 12.4% and software margins of 17.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 9%, up from 7.6% in the prior-year period; non-GAAP EPS of $0.68, representing 33% year over year; and cash flow from operations of $3.2 billion up from $1.9 billion in the prior year period. The fourth quarter closed out a strong fiscal 2006 for Hewlett-Packard.  On a year-over-year basis, revenue grew $5 billion, or 6%, to $91.7 billion.  Non-GAAP operating margins grew 1.6 points to 8% of revenue.  Non-GAAP EPS grew 47% to $2.38.  Cash flow from operations grew $3.3 billion to $11.4 billion. During the year, we also made significant progress to strengthen HP's long-term competitive position in the market, including: lowering our cost structure by substantially completing our restructuring program and beginning to work on other cost initiatives, such as our real estate consolidation initiative; bringing up capital for strategic growth initiatives, including: sales force hiring; beginning to deploy capital back into the business in the form of increased capital expenditures, aimed at transforming our IT infrastructure; and strengthen our enterprise software offerings with the purchase of Mercury Interactive, creating one of the most powerful management software portfolios in the industry. We also simplified our structure.  We collapsed matrices, created greater clarity of responsibility, focused on accountability, attracted talent to our management bench and rewarded our employees for hard work and improved performance.  I'm particularly pleased that we've been able to post another quarter of solid results while continuing to make progress on longer-term strategic issues. Now, turning to the business segments and the fourth quarter results.  Imaging and printing had a strong quarter.  Revenue grew 7% year over year to $7.3 billion, with supplies revenue growth of 9%; and revenue in commercial and consumer up 8% and 2%, respectively.  Over the past 18 months, we've been focused on accelerating supplies growth by driving hardware shipment growth in areas of high supplies consumption.  We executed well against this plan in the fourth quarter, with total printer hardware units up 17% year over year, driven by commercial printer hardware unit growth of 20% and consumer printer hardware unit growth of 16%. Momentum in key growth initiatives continue with all-in-one unit shipments up 22% year over year, appliance photo printers up 70%, color laser printer shipments up 40% and printer-based multifunction shipments up 160%.  HP Indigo Press printed page volume grew 41% over the prior year period.  This unit shipment momentum has strengthened our share leadership position in both the inkjet and laser markets, and we're confident that today's results will further extend our lead. The progress can also be tied back to the acceleration of our supplies growth rate, which in turn has helped us drive margins in the high end of the 13% to 15% operating margin range, thereby allowing us to reinvest in pricing and promotional activities as well as further technology advancements and new growth initiatives.  We will spend more time on these initiatives in our forthcoming security analysts meeting in New York City on December 12. Segment operating profit was $1.1 billion or 14.8% of revenue, up from 13.2% in the prior year period, and supplies' strength offset pricing and promotional actions taken to drive hardware replacements. All-in-all, another excellent quarter in imaging and printing. Moving now to personal systems, which had a strong quarter characterized by solid revenue growth, market share gains and record operating margins.  During the fourth quarter, revenue grew 10% year over year to $7.8 billion, driven by unit growth of 16%.  We continue to see strong performance in our notebook business with revenue growth of 24% over the prior year period, driven by double-digit revenue growth in both consumer and commercial notebooks.  Revenue in desktops was flat year over year, while revenue in workstations grew 10%. We continue to execute well in our consumer business, leveraging a competitive product line-up and strong retail partnerships.  Revenue in consumer clients increased 19% year over year, with revenue in commercial clients up 4%.  Our top line momentum has driven market share gains in recent quarters, and according to preliminary data, HP took the number one share position in PCs during the third calendar quarter. But more importantly, we gained share while driving margin expansion. During the fourth quarter, segment operating profit was $336 million or 4.3% of revenue, up from 2.8% in the prior-year period.  This represents our highest personal systems operating margins in a number of years.  You should expect us to continue to balance revenue growth and profitability by being disciplined on costs and leveraging our strengths in notebooks, in consumer, in the commercial and retail channels and in international markets. Moving on to the technology solutions group where we continue to drive significant margin expansion, giving HP some of the best balance of segment profitability we have had in many years.  We posted a solid quarter in enterprise storage and servers with revenue growth up 4% year over year to $4.7 billion and segment operating profit of $502 million or 10.7% of revenue, up from the 9% in the prior year period.  This margin represents our highest level in a number of years, and I'm pleased with the progress we have made in the last 12 months as we align ourselves to better compete in growth markets and better harvest the more mature markets in which we compete. Within ESS, we saw an acceleration of growth in industry standard servers with revenue up 9% year over year, driven by 38% growth in blades.  Revenue in storage grew 1% with growth of 11% in our mid-range EVA offerings, offset by declines in the high end array and tape business.  While the growth profile of our storage business is negatively impacted by our mix towards declining tape market, we are not happy with our storage growth in the fourth quarter and we need to do a better job of driving top line momentum in the coming year. Business critical systems revenue decreased 4% year over year with Integrity server revenue growth of 77%, offset by revenue declines in PA-RISC and Alpha.  During the quarter, we did begin shipping Montecito-based Integrity servers, and this positions us well for growth in the coming quarters.  We closed the year with approximately 9,700 ISV applications ported to Itanium and with Integrity representing 45% of Q4 business critical systems revenue. We had a solid quarter in HP Services with revenue growth of 5% year over year to $4.1 billion, led by managed services and consulting and integration growth of 16% and 7%, respectively.  Revenue in technology services was essentially flat over the prior year period. I'm pleased with the solid improvement in HPS margins.  The segment posted fourth quarter operating profit of $505 million, or 12.4% of revenue, up from 8.3% in the prior-year period. Over the past three to four quarters, we have spent considerable energy working on various costs and efficiency levers within HP Services.  We have made significant progress reducing, the unit cost of service delivery and strengthening our portfolio of standardized and automated offerings. At the same time, these efforts were supported by the other company-level cost initiatives that served to reduce the cost burden allocated to the various segments within HP.  Given the size and headcount density of HP Services, the segment benefited proportionately. I'm confident that we're in a better position to drive the appropriate operating leverage in this business.  While we have more work to do, I feel that we're now in a better position to grow and compete in the market at acceptable margins. We had a strong quarter in HP software, where revenue grew 14% over the prior year period to $349 million, driven by OpenView growth of 28%, which did benefit from the Peregrine acquisition.  Revenue in HP OpenCall declined 11% from the prior year period.  Software reported operating profit of $60 million or 17.2% of revenue, up from a profit of $28 million or 9.2% of revenue in the prior year period, reflecting the improvements we have been making to our model and associated operate leverage that comes with our scale. On November 6, we closed the acquisition of Mercury, which significantly increases our scale and strengthens our software offering.  Given Mercury's traditional fiscal year ends at December 31, we have decided to operate it as a standalone, wholly-owned subsidiary of HP until early 2007. However, we're focused on integrating Mercury as quickly and effectively as possible and work is already under way on sales tools, go-to-market programs and cross training to enable HP OpenView and Mercury sales force to sell a combined portfolio in February. We expect to launch an integrated product roadmap within 90 days of the close, and we have joint product teams working on product integration planning for HP OpenView and Mercury.  We're pleased to see the improvements in our core portfolio and believe that the combined strength of HP and Mercury position us to help CIOs enhance the value and optimize the business outcome of IT investments.  Executing against these goals will enable us to drive further revenue growth and margin expansion opportunities in HP software. Finally, bear in mind that the operating margin of the software business will be impacted by the writedown of deferred revenue and other integration costs associated with the acquisition of Mercury in the coming quarters. I will conclude my segment comments by reiterating that we had a solid fourth quarter across the entire portfolio.  I am pleased with the progress we made over the past 18 months, and we know that we have opportunities for further improvement ahead. With that, I would like to turn it over to Bob.
Bob Wayman: Thank you, Mark and good afternoon, everyone.  I will begin with a review of the performance of our financial services business.  Revenue for HPFS during the quarter was $545 million, up 6% year over year and 5% sequentially.  The revenue increase reflects increased financing volume, which was up 1% year over year and 12% sequentially.  End of lease transactions contributed to the sequential increase.  Portfolio assets increased 4% year over year and 2% sequentially, and are now at their highest level in several years. Operating margin was 6.4%, down from 10.1% from Q4 of last year and 6.7% in Q3.  The year-over-year margin decline reflects the release of certain accounts receivable reserves in the prior year period. While we're encouraged with the growth in financing volume over the last several quarters, we know we have more work to do and are focused on continuing volume momentum. Before getting into the key elements of the P&L, let me remind you that fiscal 2005 results including cost of sales, operating expenses, operating profit, net income and EPS did not include the impact of FAS 123 R stock based compensation.  Consistent with last quarter, to assist you in comparing results versus prior periods, we have included a quarterly historical EPS trend in the financial tables accompanying the earnings release.  This should allow you to view the results as though all stock-based compensation had been included in previously reported results. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.68, including approximately $0.04 from stock-based compensation, up from $0.51 a year ago, which again excluded the impact of FAS 123 R.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.60, which included $208 million, or $0.07 of after-tax adjustments, that were not included in our non-GAAP results.  The adjustments primarily relate to restructuring charges and the amortization of purchased intangibles. A quick update on restructuring.  During the quarter, approximately 4,200 positions were eliminated related to the July 2005 announcement, bringing the cumulative total to about 14,200.  While the restructuring program is substantially complete, we do expect to eliminate approximately 1,000 remaining positions in Q1 of '07. Now on to the P&L.  Revenue of $24.6 billion for the quarter was up 7% year over year and up 6% when adjusted for the effects of currency.  On a retail basis, revenue was up 8% in the Americas, up 7% in EMEA and up 6% in Asia Pacific.  When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 7% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA and 7% in Asia-Pacific. As to gross profit, gross profit was $6 billion for the quarter or 24.3% of revenue, up from 23.5% a year ago and down from 24.8% sequentially.  Gross margin improved year over year in each of our non-financing business segments, reflecting improved operational effectiveness in key areas, including options attach, delivery efficiency, utilization, and discount controls, as well as favorable mix in certain businesses. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled $3.8 billion for the quarter or 15.3% of revenue, down from 15.9% a year ago and 17.2% sequentially.  In dollars, operating expenses were up 3% year over year and flat sequentially.  Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 2% year over year and flat sequentially.  The year-over-year increase primarily reflects volume growth, the inclusion of FAS 123 R expenses and investments in growth initiatives, such as the continued hiring of sales resources as well as additional demand generation, offset by position eliminations as part of our restructuring program. Non-GAAP opening profit was $2.2 billion or 9.0% of revenue, up $470 million year over year, despite the inclusion of approximately $140 million of stock-based compensation in the current period.  Non-GAAP other income and expense was pre-tax income of $190 million or roughly $0.05 per share after tax, above the $0.03 to $0.04 per share we had guided coming into the quarter.  The excess reflects the favorable impacts of currency as well as real estate gains.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, slightly above our guidance. One other item of note in the P&L.  Unallocated corporate costs, excluding stock-based compensation, increased approximately $25 million year over year and $103 million sequentially.  The sequential increase primarily reflects an increase in lease volume and a change in the operating lease mix within HPFS.  Inter-company profit on operating lease transactions is eliminated in this line item.  As such, as volume and operating lease mix increased, the unallocated balance will grow as more eliminations are booked. Increased legal expenses also contributed to the increase both sequentially and year over year. Next, the balance sheet.  HP's inventory came in at $7.8 billion, up $873 million year over year and up $286 million sequentially.  Inventory days of supply stands at 38 days, up from 35 days last year and down from 41 days sequentially.  The year-over-year increase in inventory reflects volume growth, strategic buys and supply chain changes designed to optimize our cost structure.  The sequential increase is in line with normal seasonality. Now I know there is a lot of interest in channel inventories, so I'll add some additional perspective this quarter.  Overall, we're very comfortable with channel inventory levels.  PSG ended the quarter at roughly four weeks, ESS roughly four-and-a-half weeks and IPG at roughly five-and-a-half weeks.  PSG weeks are flat year over year, and both ESS and IPG weeks are up slightly. In terms of channel inventory dollars, ISS, which makes up the majority of ESS channel inventory, are up, in line with revenue growth.  PSG channel dollars are up only slightly compared to a 10% top line growth.  IPG channel dollar growth slightly outpaced revenue growth, reflecting increased supplies associated with significant hardware unit growth over the past year.  Total company channel inventory dollars are up roughly in line with top line performance and our outlook for the first quarter. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $10.9 billion, up $970 million year over year and $1.2 billion sequentially.  DSO now stands at 40 days, up from 39 days year over year and flat sequentially. Next, property, plant and equipment was up $412 million year over year and $494 million sequentially, at $6.9 billion.  Gross CapEx was $965 million, up 85% year over year and 55% sequentially.  On a net basis, CapEx was $868 million, up 95% year over year and 123% sequentially.  The year-over-year increase in CapEx reflects incremental investments in IT as well as increases in financing assets.  Net PP&E as a percent of revenue now stands at 7.5%, up from 7.4% year over year and 7.1% sequentially. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 59 days, up from 52 days year over year and 58 days sequentially. Now some comments on cash.  Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were both very strong at $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion respectively for the quarter.  For the full year, cash flow from operations was $11.4 billion and free cash flow was $9.4 billion, both up over 40% from fiscal 2005, which was a record cash flow year. During the quarter, we repurchased $1 billion in stock in the open market for approximately 30 million shares.  In addition, we received approximately 13 million shares under the prepaid variable share purchase program that we entered into earlier this year.  So a total of 43 million shares were acquired during the quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 190 million shares in the open market and received an additional 34 million shares under the prepaid plan.  In addition, we paid out $219 million in the quarter for our normal dividend and $894 million for the full year. We closed the quarter with gross cash of $16.4 billion, up from $13.9 billion last year and $16 billion sequentially.  Net cash was $11.2 billion, up from $8.7 billion last year and $9.2 billion sequentially.  In terms of cash usage for fiscal 2007, a significant bonus payout will occur in the first quarter related to the strong operating performance of the company in fiscal 2006, and this will put pressure on operating cash flows in Q1 '07. Beyond impact on operating cash flow, we did have a net cash outlay of approximately $4.5 billion earlier this month related to our acquisition of Mercury.  In addition, we expect fiscal 2007 gross and net CapEx to trend at or above fiscal 2006 levels as we continue to build out our data centers and deploy capital to consolidate and upgrade our real estate facilities. Now a few comments on our outlook.  Historically revenue declined a bit, over 2%, from Q4 to Q1 in constant currency.  Given where our rates are today, we do not expect a significant sequential currency effect.  On November 6, we closed the acquisition of Mercury, and you should therefore begin to incorporate their results into your estimates for HP. However, as we indicated at the time the deal was announced, purchase accounting rules required a significant writedown of deferred revenue.  As such, based on our expectations for Mercury and the results of the purchase accounting entries, we expect approximately $800 million in revenue associated with Mercury in fiscal 2007. Taking these factors into account, we estimate Q1 '07 revenue will be approximately $24.1 billion to $24.3 billion and revenue for 2007 full year to be approximately $97 billion. Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to consider.  Given the software P&L characteristics of Mercury, we expect the acquisition to have a positive effect on total company gross margin of approximately 50 basis points and a negative impact on total company expense ratio of approximately 50 basis points. On an overall basis, the Mercury transaction is expected to be approximately $0.04 dilutive to our non-GAAP per-share earnings in FY '07. In '07, we will continue to fund investments to drive short-term and long-term growth initiatives.  We expect FAS 123 R expenses of approximately $0.04 in Q1 '07 and $0.14 in FY 2007, up slightly from $0.13 in fiscal 2006.  Although we have reduced the number of options granted relative to prior-year levels, the fair value of each option granted in fiscal 2006 and expectations for fair value in fiscal 2007 grants have significantly increased, reflecting the rise in stock price and a slight increase in volatility from 2006 to 2007.  This has caused related expenses to be higher than previously anticipated, notwithstanding the reduction in option grants. With respect to restructuring, as we continue to look for ways to optimize our cost structure, we expect expenses associated with any future actions to be absorbed by our business segments, barring any significant transaction or change in our business model.  Accordingly, such expenses will be accounted for as normal business activity and will be included in our non-GAAP results.  Any adjustments to previously announced restructuring plans will still be treated as an adjustment in non-GAAP results. We estimate non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.03 to $0.04 per share per quarter in '07, which primarily reflects baseline net and trust income, given projected cash and debt levels.  We will call out deviations from this baseline as appropriate. Bear in mind that given the significant outlay of cash related to Mercury, we expect the interest income to be at the low end of the $0.03 to $0.04 guidance in Q1.  We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of about 20% for Q1 '07 and the full year. While we expect to continue to repurchase shares in fiscal 2007, given the current share price and our expectations for option exercise patterns and the impact on common stock equivalents, we expect a modest decline in shares outstanding in Q1 '07 with shares likely to be somewhat flat for the remainder of the year. With that in mind, we expect Q1 '07 non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 to $0.62, which includes approximately $0.01 dilution for Mercury.  For FY '07, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $2.48 to $2.53, which includes approximately $0.04 of dilution for Mercury. So all-in-all, we closed FY06 positively, and our increased outlook for 2007 reflects our progress to date. With that, we will take your questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from  Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff: As you look at the different business areas, is there room for further improvement?  You made a lot of improvement in terms of the margins.  Is it going to get better than this?  Specifically, can you talk about in terms of the IT savings, when do we begin to see the impact of that?
Mark Hurd: Andy, thanks for the question. Listen, we've got to do better than this.  This was a good quarter for us, clearly, in terms of how you would look at milestones along the way.  As I've said in my comments, we've been successful, I think, at delivering on the short-term milestones we have had, but frankly investing in the long term includes, to your point, being able to improve our cost structure.  Our cost structure has work left to do, and we have got to get that done at the same time as investing for growth. So we certainly are not taking any victory lap here.  We have got work to do, but I will tell you at the same time I am pleased with the progress.
Operator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America.
Keith Bachman: Thanks very much. I wanted to talk about the inventories.  If I heard you right, your comment was that it didn't impact the level of sales, since it was normalized compared to last year's.  Can you just please confirm that? My follow-up is: it does look like, correspondingly, that account receivables was up sequentially more than I would have anticipated.  So I just want to come back and see how that relates to your inventory comments and get any additional color, please, on how the AR bump might have been impacted by the sequential change in inventories.
Bob Wayman: So our fourth quarter is always back end loaded.  August is slow, and October is big.  As you saw, we exceeded revenue estimates.  And frankly, some of that comes from the strength that we saw late in the quarter, and that strength in revenue is not yet collected, so receivables tend to be a little bit higher.  We are very much impacted by consumer volumes this time of year, and it has been a strength to the company and that's reflected there. We have built our inventory.  Inventory has grown a little faster than revenue.  It is, as I said, up.  It stands at 38 days compared to 35 days last year.  But we feel good about our inventory.  It's fresh inventory; it's what we want.  The inventory build that we've actually seen in prior quarters and in this quarter have served us well in terms of meeting what continues to be a pretty decent market demand.  So we have, I think, the right levels of inventory in the right places. I mentioned strategic buys.  We have talked about this for a number of quarters.  We are buying inventory when we can get good prices on it.  That, too, has served us well.  It has helped us achieve a better cost structure and a better gross margin to be more competitive in the marketplace.
Mark Hurd: Keith, I'd just say one thing on the owned inventory side.  We're really looking at a total cost structure as we look at inventory, so inventory is one dimension of an aggregated, optimized cost structure to look at our overall COGS positioning.  Some of the owned inventory is literally a position to lower our COGS.  So this is not an accident, if you will, in terms of some of the stuff that you're describing. On the channel inventory side -- listen, we're trying to optimize the answer in the sense of both being in a position to take care of future demand at the same time as we are taking care of the quarter demand.  I think at the quarter overall, we're generally comfortable. If anything, there are stories within the story, depending on what region you go to and what product line; but when you look at the Company overall, we feel pretty comfortable with where we are.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot. Mark, could you comment on Vista and the PC market?  You had a great out performance in the quarter.  You're the number one PC company in the world.  What does Vista mean for HP, not only in the first quarter but as we go throughout the year? As I look at your guidance, it means about 5% organic growth if you exclude Mercury, which is a deceleration from the 6% the last two quarters.  I've got to think if Vista is any bit of an accelerator to the market, that's conservative guidance.  So go ahead.  That's all the questions.
Bob Wayman: I appreciate the color on the guidance, Ben.  I think the point on the PC business is that when you look at constant currency, our performance has been pretty steady, I think, when you look at. On Vista, right now, as it relates to the short term, we just don't know what will happen as it comes up to the holiday and really even not just the holiday, but post-holiday to introduction may be a window that we just can't forecast well enough to be able to tell you exactly how it will work out. Now, as it relates to the long term, we feel good about it and we feel good about our positioning within Vista.  We think we're well-positioned from an offering perspective.  And clearly not just Vista, but the collection of where we see demand based on what market segment, where we see it by region and our product line of combined -- yes, we feel pretty good about how we're positioned.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers.
Harry Blount: Thank you. I just want to circle back on the restructuring, Bob.  You may have mentioned it in the comments, but I missed it.  You guys are now largely complete with the headcount reductions, but the cost savings still should carry over into fiscal '07. Could you remind me a little bit of how much the incremental impact is going to be in fiscal '07?
Bob Wayman: I'm not going to give you a new update for '07.  What I will say is that when you look year over year, certainly there's going to be significantly more cost savings in '07 than what we saw in '06.  So we have been coming down in headcount; or I should say our restructuring effects have been a couple thousand a quarter until the fourth quarter, where it was 4,200.  Obviously, we have not seen the full year benefit of that. So expect to see additional savings from the actions we have taken.
Harry Blount: Right.  What I was driving at was trying to get an understanding of how much of the EPS improvement year-over-year in guidance in '07 is coming from the restructuring actions of '06 versus just core continued improvement in mix and other areas.
Mark Hurd: I don't we broke that out, Harry.
Bob Wayman: The guidance we gave you a year ago in terms of savings of was around $1 billion in '06?
Brian Humphries: About $1.9 billion to $2 billion.
Bob Wayman: Right.  With around $1 billion or so of that in '06 getting significantly higher in '07.
Mark Hurd: Harry, just to give you a few data points, remember that part of that was a pension that we got early in the year in 2006.  And then you've seen a blending of the improvements in Q1/Q2 into some of our sequential quarter performance.  So clearly from Q4, our actions sequentially will begin to have some effects now in '07.  But we had a one-time pension action that occurred at the end of '05.  It went on in '06, and then we blended it in from there. So that's really where we're at with it. Of course, as we discussed at the time, some of that will get reinvested back into the business in terms of whether it be pricing or competitiveness in proposals or going to hire a sales resource, et cetera.  But clearly, it will be a help to us.
Bob Wayman: Just one other item as well.  We did say that those gross savings, that maybe half of it would fall to the bottom line.  Certainly, some of the success that you're seeing in Q4 comes from investing some of that back and driving better top line results with demand generation spending.  Hopefully, over the longer term, some of the hiring we are doing of additional salespeople will lead to additional growth as well.
Mark Hurd: Yes, Harry, I don't think that should be lost here that part of what we're doing here is to try to do further work to variables in our cost structure.  When we do see opportunities in the marketplace to grow and hopefully grow profitably, we will use some of that flexibility to take advantage of the opportunity.  So we think we've made a bit of progress on this.  We still got some work to do.
Operator: Your next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs.
Laura Conigliaro: Thank you. Can you provide some observations on what's happening on the component front including pricing?  For example, which components seem to be in short supply and where the situation has gotten worse or better?  You had previously referred to the possibility, for example, of better CPU pricing, given the AMD/Intel competition.  Are you seeing any of that yet?
Bob Wayman: Certainly, we did see memory pricing pressures and availability issues in Q4.  We did get most of them resolved by the time we finished up.  We did pay a little more money for memory than we had planned going into the quarter in a couple of our businesses.  So memory has been the commodity of interest in Q4. But we also had a few issues on microprocessors, particular types of microprocessors. Panels have been in good supply and pricing has been favorable there. Panels is one area that we have done some strategic buying, much to our advantage. Hard drives, really no change. A very competitive marketplace, availability is pretty good.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: Another question on the PC business if I could.  It relates to what looks to be a pretty significant shortfall in motherboard shipments out of Taiwan, desktop motherboards, in particular, which has led folks to believe that PC demand is deteriorating.  It certainly doesn't look like you saw that in your results, but I'd love to get your thoughts on the current demand environment and any color that you can give us by customer segment and geographic region would be helpful.
Mark Hurd: I would say that demand does differ a little by region and sometimes frankly within region.  But if you aggregate it together, it is stable; stable market demand.  So from that perspective, we don't see that instability that you're describing.  Again, I could go into lots of different stories by segment, by country.  But when you net it all together, we saw stable demand.
Richard Gardner: Could I follow up and just ask, Mark, if --
Mark Hurd: Isn't that against Brian's rules?  But go ahead.  Go ahead.
Richard Gardner: The question was whether you could give us any visibility of whether there was a sharp or significant downtick in commercial PC demand during the quarter?
Mark Hurd: No. I can't say I saw that. We saw pretty stable demand.  Again, it can vary. If  you ask me corporate by country, I could get into a couple but when you looked at the aggregate, no.  Our real issue in the quarter, if anything, on the supply side was in memory, as Bob has referenced, we paid up a little bit for memory.  I wish we hadn't, but we did.  Our overall macro demand picture was roughly stable.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. Your gross margins declined about 50 basis points sequentially.  If I look at your business mix, it looks perfectly neutral on a sequential basis.  Supplies were up pretty well in line with company revenue and the enterprise group, which also has pretty good margins, actually up fractionally as a percentage of sales.  So it doesn't appear to be a mix issue.  Were you incrementally more aggressive on price then, and can you comment across what product family?
Mark Hurd: I'll start, Tony.  I think it is fair that in a couple of groups, we saw opportunity for growth and we took it.  So for example, in IPG, and you looked at overall mix, the mix is sequentially different as it relates to supplies versus hardware, which shows up in our 17% hardware unit growth.  So clearly, I wouldn't describe it as an issue underneath, but certainly in the mix of hardware and certainly, that did have an effect on our margins.
Bob Wayman: Tony, mix within segment is also important.  Sticking with IPG, as we mentioned in the script, very strong growth in our basic level printers.  I think it was 60%.  But anyway, it's in the script, a very large growth and very large growth in color laser.  Both of those are lower-margin products than some of the other items in our line.  So, while overall hardware may have been the same, we could definitely see a different mix of hardware within that hardware slice of the pie.
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch.
Richard Farmer: Mark and Bob, you both talked about cash flow and cash generation in the quarter.  Bob, you made some comments about the first quarter of '07 that the share count would modestly decline and about flat in all of '07 if I heard you right.  I'm just trying to reconcile, you have $16 billion of cash on the balance sheet, net cash $11 billion.  I understand you have to pay $4.5 billion for Mercury, but you're also generating $9 billion in operating, $7 billion in free cash flow. So what are your priorities for the cash over the next couple of years? Why wouldn't you use the majority of the $7 billion in free cash generation for buybacks?  Why wouldn't share count go down a lot more than you articulated?
Bob Wayman: Of course, I have to say I don't know because it all depends upon what happens to share price and some other things.  While we did spend $4.5 billion on Mercury, that's just in Q1.  Who knows what we will need for acquisitions throughout the year?  So all of this is based upon a bunch of assumptions. I will tell you my comments assumed that we would continue using a good hunk of that free cash flow for share buybacks.  Keep in mind, though, that the share price is quite a bit higher today than it was on average for '06, and so it just doesn't go as far. Furthermore, as the share price moves up, option exercises pick up.  We've seen that. We saw that in Q4.  We saw it throughout the year.  We saw it again in Q4.  My comments assumed that as we get into the 40s here, we will see even more option exercises. So it's all of those variables mixed together.  One other, I should mention, of course, we have to calculate common stock equivalents, which again gets directly driven by increased share price. So there is a lot of dynamics here.  It's my best guess that it comes down a little in Q1 and then stay roughly flat. Could it come down a little bit more?  We'll see.  Do we intend to keep buying, I'll call it aggressively?  Yes, unless something else changes in the world around us.
Mark Hurd: One thing, we're going to be active in the area.  I think the point is we have worked real hard to get our option overhang down.  We're working on it.  We will continue to be active.  So, to Bob's point, I don't think you should have any expectations that we won't be.  But we've got other factors as we consider our aggregated capital strategy.
Bob Wayman: Yes, we do have $5.6 billion remaining of the authorization that the Board acted on last quarter.
Operator: Your next question comes from Rebecca Runkle - Morgan Stanley.
Rebecca Runkle: Mark, just a quick question following up on your storage performance and comments.  Clearly, a phenomenal quarter across the board, but you noted storage is one area of weakness.  Just as you sit here now and look at that business, what in your mind are the issues?  Is it technology?  Is it product? Is it go to market?  What are the top strategies for turning that business around over the next four quarters?
Mark Hurd: There's a couple of different dimensions to it, Rebecca.  First, it's a business that has worked hard to improve its operating margin, which it has done.  I think that part is a positive, so I don't want to take away from that.  But to be very blunt, I'm disappointed in the revenue growth for the business.  The market is a strong market for us.  We're investing in the market.  We think we actually have a pretty strong product line-up right now.  We just need to do a better job from a demand creation perspective. There's opportunities for us in the mid-market that we think are important for us to go get.  As I go through our field checks, we feel about as good about our product line-up as we have in quite a while.  We have done a decent job at improving the operating margin of the business. We need to go get more business.  We have invested in software.  We do have the tape declines, but we still think we can do better.  And we're going to go focus on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan.
Bill Shope: Great, thanks. Can you guys comment on the pricing environment in PCs for both the commercial and the consumer segments?  There's been a lot of chatter that perhaps your largest competitor has eased up on pricing somewhat.  I'm wondering if you saw any evidence of this throughout the quarter.
Mark Hurd: Nothing spectacular, Bill.  I would say that the quarter was steady.  We didn't see anything extraordinary from a pricing perspective.  But I say that against the backdrop of a pretty aggressive environment, period.  We have more than one competitor out there. So when you look at different markets, there are different people that show up as competitors.  Obviously, we're very global and we're very competitive in many markets.  So I think we would say there's nothing extraordinary.  But there are multiple competitors out there.  The environment, I would say was steady.  That would probably be the best way I could describe it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brian Alexander - Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Thank you. Just a clarification and then a question on service profitability.  The clarification on the revenue guidance, I just want to make sure I understand.  We should assume that you're looking for normal seasonality in the first quarter as well as normal seasonality in the PC business specifically to get to the range that you provided.  Then, I have a follow-up.
Bob Wayman: Yes, there's no particular new trend that we're trying to convey here.  The guidance, I think, fits with normal trends.
Brian Alexander: Great.  Then on the service margin, can you just talk about the profitability that you saw in each of the segments within HPS?  Where did you see the biggest increase in profitability in what I thought was actually a negative mix shift away from tech services and more toward managed services and consulting?
Mark Hurd: So, a couple of points.  Bob, we don't give the profitability numbers out by segment specifically.  But I would say there are three kinds of costs in the service business.  As I mentioned in my prepared comments, there's overhead costs that comes from the corporation into services.  Because of its headcount profile, it absorbs quite a bit of that overhead, point 1. Point 2, any services business, even across all three segments, has its own overhead, infrastructure.  You can go down a whole number of different characteristics. Then, you have the actual service delivery itself, and we're working on all three lines.  Those improvements in all three pieces have led us to improved profitability in both consulting and integration and in managed services that has also benefited, to some degree, technology services, even with the revenue performance we've had.
Operator: Your next question comes from Louis Miscioscia - Cowen.
Louis Miscioscia: Thank you. Maybe if we could stick with the services area, in the sense you obviously had a very good quarter.  Is this something that we should, from a revenue standpoint, expect to continue on a sequential basis?  Because services is a little bit less seasonal to hardware and some other things.  Maybe if you could also talk about the pipeline?
Mark Hurd: Services is still a little seasonal.  Q4 is usually our best quarter from a profitability point of view, and Q1 is often a bit more challenged, both on the top line and bottom line.  So while it may be less seasonal, there are seasonal trends.  Part of it is driven also by projects.  So while there is a lot of annuity run rate to the business, there are projects and managed services transactions, and some we pursue.  Frankly, right now, we are very picky about what we do pursue. We have two characteristics: one, that we can make money; and second, that we can deliver the service we commit to.  If either one of those are not there, we will typically walk away from a transaction.  So that's the main reason. Again, I believe that costs drives growth and that we're trying to get our cost structure right.  As we do, we will be in a better position to grow. But we're very particular about how we grow, profitably.
Bob Wayman: So let me just summarize a bit here.  Certainly, the profit improvements that you saw in Q4 in services, some of them are quite fundamental and we expect them to continue.  At the same time, I wouldn't extrapolate sequentially from Q4 into Q1 when it comes to profit.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore: I wanted to follow up on the inventory question.  You have been making strategic buys now for the past several quarters.  Should we think about your inventory levels as being structurally higher going forward?  In other words, is it an ongoing part of the business we should expect going forward? Secondly, you mentioned you are making strategic buys in panels, but availability and supply of panels is quite good.  I wanted to understand that dynamic a little better.
Bob Wayman: Let me start, and Mark can chime in.  So with regard to panels, as an example, there are times when suppliers come to us and say, I've got this inventory and I will give you a really good price if you buy it from me and take delivery in the next three days, even though we don't need delivery for 20 days or something like that.  If it's worth it, we will consider doing that kind of thing.  Obviously, we have the financial capacity to do so. So we look at the trade-off between the inventory carrying costs, what we think the price trends would be and how much better this is than what we would predict trends to be.  Frankly, it has helped us over the past year. Whether it's structural or not, that particular one, I don't know.  It just depends upon what vendors bring to the table.  They could stop doing that, and then that would go away. Other inventory investments that we have made, we mentioned, for example, some changes in the supply chain.  We're moving product production around the world to get lower prices, but it adds to the inventory pipeline.  That is probably going to continue -- not forever -- but it is driven generally by country-based economics and is unlikely to change quickly.  So that's probably going to be with us for a little while.
Mark Hurd: I think just to add to it, first on the panels, sometimes more supply actually creates the best deals, to Bob's point.  Secondly, we have had significant demand for consumer notebooks across the year.  So it has been quite strong.  I think, thirdly, we want to get away from thinking about inventory as an isolated metric.  I like a lot of metrics, but you can get overmetricized in some of these areas.  We want to look at the aggregated ability to get our capital leveraged at the same time as be able to get the best profitability out in the marketplace.  Inventory is only one component of the aggregated mix. So we're looking very hard at inter-relating the inventory positions to take to our ability to get into a positive pricing environment or our ability to compete. So a long answer to your question, but the answer is we may keep these inventory levels the way they are if we think it provides an aggregate economic benefit to Hewlett-Packard.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jesse Tortora - Prudential.
Jesse Tortora: Thanks. Hi, guys. PSG operating margin increased to 4.3%, ESS to 10.7% in the quarter.  What do you think the key drivers were behind this, and what is your outlook for these segments going forward?
Mark Hurd: Well, we will talk more about our outlook going forward when we get to New York, other than that, we're not going to give any more than the guidance we gave today.  I think, in PSG, we continue to have strong performance in notebooks and a strong mix.  I think it's basically what we've said.  You have seen us take positions in inventory, and the strategic buys have helped us from a margin perspective.  We benefited from a mix of and leverage between AMD and Intel, a series of things that we have talked about over the past quarters. I think, in ISS, which has a main driver in terms of ESS, you've had the same kind of effect from an industry standard server perspective.  It doesn't hurt when you grow because you leap over a lot of your fixed cost structures.  So when you get 9% growth in ISS, 38% growth in blades, it tends to have an effect for you.  So I think for us, it's a mix of growth.  It's a mix of balance and our ability to leverage our supply chain.  We feel we've made some improvement. I can tell you this: that we are focused on trying to do better.
Operator: Your next question comes from Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest.
Bill Fearnley: Thanks, good afternoon. How should we be thinking about levers that drive corporate gross margin improvement going forward?  What is the biggest lever?  Is it mix?  Is it component cost trends?  Is it the buys that you are doing?  Is it attach rate?  How should we be thinking about gross margin improvement now?
Bob Wayman: I think you hit on all the right points.  For us remember, a big part of our gross margin is cost of service.  So it isn't just what you see in the COGS line, which you hit I think quite effectively in terms of our ability to get the attach levels right and the ability to get the mix right. So for us, Bob, I thought made a very important point about the mix of software.  It's going to now start folding into our P&L.  That is going to have an effect on our gross margin, and I think that's a positive. We certainly are doing more work in intellectual property around all of our hardware segments at the same time as we're trying to optimize the mix of all components, whether it be microprocessor all the way through the supply chain; taking better inventory positions, better attach. Cost of service though, is mainly a headcount-driven model that we're also trying to work hard to not only leverage our labor model but also deal with automating our service processes. I think, with those we've said, we've hit a majority of the levers.  At the same time, we have got some fixed cost structure that goes up there too.  So we're trying to pull them all.
Operator: Your final question comes from Dan Renouard - Robert Baird.
Dan Renouard: Thanks for taking my question. My question is just on the sales hiring and your progress there.  Can you maybe give us some metrics in terms of the success you have had or where you're at in terms of either number of salespeople added or just how you think about progress there and how much more you have left to do?
Bob Wayman: I think the answer is “sort of” to your question.  We don't give out the numbers by group and so forth in terms of that kind of metric.  But I think it would be fair to say that we made significant progress.  I'd say we got more than halfway to the goal that we were hoping to get to. I can tell you internally we had all kinds of optimistic plans to get people in.  But frankly, getting this done, well it's more important to us to get this done right than to just show up with a bunch of headcount.  So we're really looking for quality people that can really help us change the game.  I'd say we made what I believe to be the expected progress you would make doing this.  We have more to do.  If you know of great people who know a lot about enterprise selling and channel selling, we would love to talk to them.
Mark Hurd: Thanks, Bob. We're going to wrap up.  Let me just summarize today's call by saying that I am pleased with our progress in the fourth quarter.  HP delivered solid revenue growth to gain market share in key businesses. It drove significant growth in key initiatives, expanded our margins across our segments, delivered our most balanced segment profitability and posted record quarterly cash flow from operations. We did do this while continuing to make progress on our cost structure by substantially completing our restructuring program and making further progress on strategic initiatives that will strengthen HP's long-term competitive positioning and increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the fifth consecutive quarter. All-in-all, it was a solid quarter for HP, closing out a strong fiscal 2006.  We do have more work to do, though.  That said, I do believe we're on our way to building a stronger, more competitive HP. Finally, we look forward to seeing you in New York City at our annual securities analyst meeting on December 12.  Thanks again for joining us on the call.
Operator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

===== 2006 Q3  (2006-08-17 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the third quarter 2006 Hewlett-Packard earnings conference call. My name is Melanie and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session at the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Humphries, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.
Brian Humphries: Good afternoon, everybody and thanks for joining us. I would like to welcome you to our third quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today as usual is our CEO and President, Mark Hurd and CFO, Bob Wayman. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call is being webcast live. The webcast and the third quarter earnings slide presentation, including non-GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on the information page of HP Investor Relations under company information at hp.com. A replay will also be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the third quarter. However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual future results may vary materially. I encourage you to read the risk factors described in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year October 31, 2005, the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006, as well as other SEC reports filed after that report. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses and similar items discussed at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including in-process R&D, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges, and net investment gains or losses. A presentation of GAAP financial information for the present quarter and fiscal year to-date and reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations page under company information at hp.com. Finally, and with a view to allowing time for questions from multiple firms, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Hurd.
Mark Hurd: Thanks, Brian. First, good afternoon and thanks for joining us. HP delivered a solid third quarter. We posted revenue growth, expanded margins while gaining share in key segments, and generated strong cash flow from operations. Financial highlights of the quarter include revenue growth of 5% year over year, or in dollars, $1.1 billion to $21.9 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin of 24.8%, up 1.6 percentage points over the prior-year period. Continued year-over-year operating margin expansion in key businesses, with Personal Systems margins at 4%, Imaging and Printing margins at 14.2%, Enterprise Storage and Server margins at 7.2%, HP Services margins of 9.4% and Software margins of 4.1%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 7.6%, up from 5.7% in the prior-year period. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, representing growth of 44% year over year and cash flow from operations of $2.6 billion. That brings year-to-date cash flow from operations to $8.1 billion, which represents an annual record, after just nine months of the year. I am pleased we have been able to post another quarter of solid results and at the same time, and I think just as importantly, we have made progress on strategic initiatives that will strengthen HP's long-term competitive positioning in the market. On July 25, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase Mercury Interactive. Once completed, the transaction will bring together two market-leading businesses to create one of the most powerful management software portfolios in the industry. It will improve HP's position in the enterprise and enable us to drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. We continue to drive towards a lower-cost structure by transforming our IT infrastructure by announcing our intent to consolidate and streamline our real estate portfolio over the coming years, and by eliminating approximately 1,900 positions as part of our restructuring program. These actions reduce our cost structure, allowing us to be more competitive in the market. As I have said before, cost and growth are one and the same and these are fundamental to our operating model principle. You will see us spend money to lower our cost structure and save money to invest in growth. The IT transformation and real estate programs mentioned above are good examples of these. Now, let me turn to the business segments. Imaging and Printing had a solid quarter. Revenue grew 5% year over year to $6.2 billion, fueled by year-over-year unit shipment growth of 15% off a tough compare, and a supplies revenue growth of 9%. Revenue in Commercial Hardware grew 3% over the prior-year period, while Consumer Hardware revenue declined 3%. As I said previously, we are focused on leveraging our best-in-class technology, brand preference, our strong retail presence, and a lower cost structure to accelerate supplies growth by driving shipments in areas of high-ink consumption. The strategy is driving success, with third-quarter consumer inkjet hardware unit shipments up 13% year over year, led by all-in-one growth of 17%. We are also seeing continued momentum in our digital photography initiative. In the third quarter, Snapfish acquired its 30-millionth user and by generating approximately 5 million prints in a single day, set another daily prints record. Commercial printer hardware unit shipments grew 23% year over year, fueled by color laser shipments growth of 7%. We are confident that this unit growth will drive further market share gains from calendar quarter Q106 levels, which already represented our highest market share position in nine quarters. Many of our growth initiatives are in the enterprise, and we continue to see strong momentum here as well. During the quarter, printer-based MFP units shipment grew 196% over the prior-year period, and HP Indigo digital press page volume grew 37%. We also continue to build out our commercial printing sales force to take advantage of growth opportunities in enterprise imaging and printing. You should expect to see us continue to aggressively target these markets, driving the shift from analog to digital and leveraging our technology leadership and broad portfolio solutions that better address enterprise customer needs for managing digital information. IPG segment operating profit was $884 million, or 14.2% of revenue, up from 13% in the prior-year period, as supplies strength offset pricing and promotional actions taken to drive hardware placements. Personal Systems continued to post solid results, with revenue up 8% year over year to $6.9 billion, led by notebook growth of 14% and desktop growth of 5%. Operating profit was $275 million or 4% of revenue, up from 2.6% in the prior-year period. This margin percentage represents our highest level in a number of years and I am particularly pleased with this performance, given that this is typically our seasonally weakest quarter. We do remain focused on profitable growth and continue to execute well in the sweet spots of the market in consumer, mobility and emerging markets. At the same time, our lower cost structure and progress on reducing costs of goods sold in areas such as warranty has allowed us to better address the commercial PC market opportunity. During the quarter, revenue in consumer clients grew 17% year over year and revenue in commercial clients grew 4%. Total unit shipments grew 14% over the prior-year period, with double-digit growth in every region, driving share gains in both desktops and notebooks. Turning now to enterprise storage and servers, where revenue grew 3% year over year to $4.1 billion. Within ESS, industry-standard server revenue growth accelerated to 6%, with strong growth in blades, where revenue increased 37%. During the third quarter, we unveiled our new C-class blade offerings, which offer customers significant power pooling management and virtualization advantages. These have been very well accepted by the market and we expect continued strong blade growth momentum in the fourth quarter. Revenue in storage grew 5% with ongoing strength in external arrays, where revenue in our high-end XP and mid-range EVA offerings grew 19% and 17% respectively. Business-critical systems revenue decreased 6% year over year, with Integrity server revenue growth of 76%, offset by revenue declines in PA-RISC and Alpha. We will begin to ship Montecito-based integrity servers in Q4 to position us well as we end the calendar year. Enterprise storage and servers posted third-quarter operating margins of $296 million or 7.2% of revenue, up from 3.7% in the prior-year period, led by margin expansion. Given typical third-quarter seasonality, I am pleased with the operating margin performance in the quarter. Going forward, we will continue to balance margin improvement with revenue growth, and as part of this, we continue to reinvest in the business via product innovation, pricing actions, and the building out of our enterprise sales force. Revenue in HP Services grew 1% year over year to $3.9 billion, reflecting the impact of currency and a focus on profitability improvements. Excluding the effects of currency, revenue in HP Services grew 2% year over year. Within HPS, and on a year-over-year dollar basis, revenue in managed services and consulting integration grew 9% and 3% respectively, and revenue in technology services declined 1%. HPS reported operating profit of $364 million, or 9.4% of revenue, up from 6.7% in the prior-year period, reflecting solid margin expansion across all of our businesses. Over the past few quarters, we have shown strong margin improvement in managed services and consulting and integration, and at the same time, we have seen strength in technology services margins. The margin improvement reflects efforts on reducing our cost structure via labor management and efficiency measures, as well as process standardization and automation. We will continue to focus on these levers to optimize the cost structure of the business and align for greater revenue growth in fiscal year ‘07. Revenue in software grew 30% over the prior-year period to $318 million, with revenue in HP OpenView and HP OpenCall increasing 34% and 21% respectively. Software reported an operating profit of $13 million, or 4.1% of revenue, up from a loss of 15.1% in the prior-year period. We are pleased to have strengthened our Software portfolio by announcing that we have signed a definitive agreement to purchase Mercury Interactive. Combining Mercury with HP Software will create an annual run-rate business of more than $2 billion. We believe this combination provides revenue growth of approximately 10% to 15%, and think this business can drive operating margin of approximately 20% of revenue in fiscal year ‘08. I will leave my segment comments at that. Now I would like to turn it over to Bob.
Bob Wayman: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I will begin with a review of the performance of our financial services business. Revenue for HPFS during the quarter was $519 million, up 6% year over year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects the reclassification of certain leases in Q305 from operating to capital leases, which resulted in a $40 million net reduction in revenue last year. Revenue was down approximately 2% when normalized for the prior-year re-class. Financing volume increased 10% year over year and 11% sequentially. Portfolio assets increased 4% year over year and were flat sequentially. Operating margin was 6.7%, down from 11.9% in Q3 of last year and 7.5% in Q2. We were encouraged to see growth in volumes this quarter and are taking steps to continue volume momentum while balancing the risk profile of the portfolio, which remains in very good shape. Before getting into the key elements of the P&L, let me remind you that fiscal 2005 results, including cost of sales, operating expense, operating profit, net income and EPS, did not include the impact of FAS-123R stock-based compensation. Consistent with last quarter, to assist you in comparing results versus prior periods, we have included the quarterly historical EPS trend in the financial tables accompanying the earnings release. This should allow you to view the results as though all stock-based compensation had been included in previously reported results. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.52, including approximately $0.03 from stock-based compensation, up from $0.36 a year ago, which again excluded the impact of FAS-123R. In addition to operational factors, there were several items that impacted our results this quarter. Non-GAAP operating income and expense was pre-tax income of $221 million, or roughly $0.06 per share after tax, above the guidance range of $0.03 to $0.04 per share we had estimated coming into the quarter. The excess reflects the impact of real estate gains and losses during the quarter. As we indicated last quarter, the timing of one-time items, such as land and building sales, are difficult to predict and we will continue to call them out as appropriate. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.5% for the quarter, above the guidance range of 20%, which negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.01. Weighted average shares outstanding declined to 2.839 billion from 2.887 billion in Q2, which benefited EPS by approximately $0.01 relative to our guidance of shares being flat from second-quarter levels. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.48, which included $108 million, or $0.04 after-tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results. The majority of the adjustments relate to the amortization of purchased intangibles. Just a quick update on restructuring. During the quarter, approximately 1,900 positions were eliminated related to the July 2005 announcement, bringing the cumulative total to about 10,000. Now, on to the P&L. Revenue of $21.9 billion for the quarter was up 5% year-over-year, and up 6% when adjusted for the effects of currency. On a regional basis, revenue was up 8% in the Americas, up 2% in EMEA and up 7% in Asia Pacific. When adjusted for the effect of currency, revenue was up 7% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA and 8% in Asia Pacific. Now, I know there is a lot of interest in currency movements, so I will add some perspective on the impact this quarter. In an effort to mitigate the impact of currency to the bottom line, we hedged the majority of our exposed currency on a short-term basis. Though the policy helped limit volatility of currency movements on earnings, gains or losses associated with the hedge contracts are recorded in revenue. Thus, our revenue is impacted by two elements: market movements in currency rates and gains or losses on the hedge contracts. The majority of printing contracts are entered into somewhat in advance of the quarter, and the timing can depend upon the nature of the business being hedged. Therefore, the currency impact in a given quarter is dependent upon a number of factors, including: the nature and number of hedged contracts, natural hedges within specific businesses, the volatility of the spot market, et cetera. The net impact of currency movement on our revenue typically lags actual market movement, given the timing of our hedging contracts. As we indicated to you last quarter, given the accounting rate used in Q3 ‘05 and the rate of timing of hedged contracts that we entered into hedging into Q3 ‘06, we did not expect a significant year-over-year currency impact in Q3. During Q3 ‘06, actual market currency movements positively impacted revenue growth by just under 100 basis points. However, the impact of hedging transactions negatively impacted revenue year-over-year by just over 100 basis points, resulting in a net negative impact of approximately 20 basis points, enough to cause constant currency growth to round up to 6%. Now, on to gross profit, which was $5.4 billion for the quarter or 24.8% of revenue, up from 23.2% a year ago and flat sequentially. Gross margins improved year-over-year in each of our non-financing business segments, reflecting improved operational effectiveness in key areas, including option attach, delivery efficiency, utilization and discounting, as well as favorable mix in certain businesses. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled $3.75 billion for the quarter or 17.2% of revenue, down from 17.5% a year ago and up from 16.8% sequentially. In dollars, operating expenses were up 3% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 3% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially. The year-over-year increase reflects volume growth, FAS 123 R expense, investments in sales force hiring, demand generation and other go-to-market initiatives, as well as significant employee bonus accruals commensurate with the improved financial performance of the Company. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.7 billion or 7.6% of revenue, up $475 million year-over-year, despite the inclusion of approximately $130 million of stock-based compensation in the current period. Next, the balance sheet. HP-owned inventory came in at $7.5 billion, up $820 million year-over-year and $696 million sequentially. Inventory days of supply stands at 41 days, up from 38 days last year and 36 days sequentially. The increase of inventory reflects strategic buys of confidence, as well as volume growth. With regard to channel inventory, ESS and PSG ended the quarter at roughly five weeks, and IPG at roughly five-and-a-half weeks. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $9.6 billion, up $867 million year-over-year and down $152 million sequentially. DSO now stands at 40 days, up from 38 days year-over-year and 39 days sequentially. The dollar increase in receivables was due to revenue growth, as well as exchange rate fluctuations, which was also a significant driver of the increase in DSO year-over-year. Property, plant and equipment was down $61 million year-over-year and essentially flat sequentially at $6.4 billion. Gross CapEx was $623 million, up 88% year-over-year and 20% sequentially. On a net basis, CapEx was $389 million, up 87% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase in CapEx reflects incremental investments in IT, as well as increases in financing assets. Net PP&E as a percentage of revenue now stands at 7.1%, down from 7.5% last year and 7.2% sequentially. Coming into FY 2006, we expected full-year gross capital expenditures of $2.8 billion and net CapEx of $2.2 billion, which assumes capital expenditures would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. While we continue to expect a significant amount of CapEx in Q4 2006, the full-year capital expenditures are likely to be somewhat less than our initial expectations. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 58 days, up from 51 days a year ago and 53 days sequentially. Next, some comments on cash. Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were both strong, at $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion respectively for the quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was excellent, at $8.1 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $7.0 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Year to date, we have already generated more operating and free cash flow than we did in all of fiscal 2005, which was a record cash flow year. During the quarter, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock in the open market, or approximately 72 million shares. In addition, we received approximately 13 million shares under the prepaid variable share purchase program that we entered into earlier this year, so a total of 85 million shares were acquired during the quarter. Given the level of share repurchases, our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $6 billion for share repurchases. The total remaining repurchase authorization is currently just above that amount. Finally, we utilized $222 million in cash for our normal quarterly dividend. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $16 billion, up from $14.6 billion year-over-year and $14.1 billion sequentially. Net cash was $9.2 billion, up from $8.8 billion year-over-year and $9.0 billion sequentially. In terms of cash usage, do bear in mind that we expect the Mercury acquisition to close in the fourth calendar quarter, and this will result in a substantial cash outlay in either Q4 2006 or Q1 2007, depending upon the timing of the close. Now, a few comments on our outlook. As you know, we normally see strong sequential revenue growth coming into Q4. Given where rates are today, we would expect a modest sequential currency benefit. At the same time, the current macroeconomic environment and competitive environments contain some uncertainties. Taking all these factors into account, we estimate Q4 2006 revenue will be approximately $24.1 billion, in line with current consensus analyst expectations. Regarding earnings, there are a few variables to consider. We will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives. We estimate non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.03 to $0.04 per share in Q4, which primarily reflects baseline net interest income given projected cash and debt levels. We will call out deviations from this baseline is appropriate. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20% in Q4. Given the level of share repurchases we executed in Q3, we expect weighted average shares outstanding to decline modestly in Q4. Potential increases or decreases to share count are dependent upon our continuing share repurchase activity, HP's stock price, option exercise patterns and common stock equivalents. With that in mind, we know expect Q4 2006 non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 to $0.63, which includes approximately $0.03 of stock-based compensation. With that, we will move on to questions.
Operator: (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Bill Shope – JP Morgan.
Bill Shope: Thank you. There's been a lot of debate in the industry over the roll that AMD has played in some of the changes we've seen in the competitive landscape. Can you give us perhaps a qualitative read at least, on how significant you think AMD has been to your relative cost structure improvements? As is being discussed quite a bit, if Dell begins to use AMD more aggressively in their PC line, do you think there's a risk that some of these improvements could be reversed or narrowed?
Mark Hurd: Well, we think competition is good, Bill. I think competition drives a better market and a better overall ecosystem for the industry. So I think that it might sound strange to you, but we actually think that more adoption is actually a good thing on a macro basis. So we would actually be encouraging that kind of thing to occur, as opposed to not looking for that kind of a thing to occur. The more industry adoption, the more competition, we think the better the market.
Operator: Our next question comes from Laura Conigliaro - Goldman Sachs.
Laura Conigliaro: On the inventory side, you indicated that you made some strategic purchases. First of all, is that consistent with your outlook for demand, or consistent with what you think the supply outlook is? Then, can you talk a little bit about the component situation as you see it now and going forward?
Bob Wayman: On the strategic buy side, it's mostly in the PC business. It is a reflection, certainly, of what we typically see as strong demand in Q4. But beyond that, when we say strategic, we mean that it's different than our normal purchases, which is done either because we have a particularly good cost opportunity;  that is, we're given a really good deal. Or because we have some concern for supply. In this case the past quarter, it was mainly because we had some offers to get some good purchases. Overall, the commodity situation has been pretty normal. normal price declines, normal availability. The only exception to that probably is panels. Panel prices have been coming down fast. We think they have now stabilized. We will see what happens going forward here. But going into the heavy consumer fourth quarter of the year, there is some concern that pricing could get a little tighter on some panels.
Operator: Our next question comes from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley.
Katie Huberty: Thanks guys.  You are clearly executing well on the revenue front. But Bob, you did mention some uncertainties in the broader market. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of broad demand trends, and then what linearity looked like in the quarter?
Mark Hurd: Linearity was fine in the quarter for us, so there's no story for us inside the quarter of this versus that. I'd say that was fine. We listen to the same stuff you listen to, so we hear stories of all types. I'd say, when you boil it all together, what our data tells us is things are "relatively steady" with stories within the story. We continue to keep our eye on U.S. consumer, which is an important market for us. We hear the same stories you hear about where U.S. consumer is headed. But given the data we're seeing, I would net it all together globally to say steady.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein.
Tony Sacconaghi: Thank you.  You had mentioned revenue growth and trying to strike a balance between profitability and revenue growth, Mark. This was the fifth quarter that you have presided over HP. It was the lowest revenue growth at constant currency since you have been at the helm, albeit modestly lower than the other quarters. Your guidance, given the currency outlook, is for it to decline, year-over-year revenue growth to decline even further. If we think about how you have been doing relative to your guidance, you have been blowing out EPS;  you beat EPS by $0.05 or more every quarter since you have been CEO,  but you really haven't been beating the revenue number. The question is, have you been pleased with the revenue performance? Why not reinvest some of that earnings upside that you have been delivering, to deliver some revenue upside? How do you think about that trade-off? Have you been extremely pleased with EPS and comfortable with revenue growth, or have you been modestly disappointed, given the divergence in your actual performance versus guidance on those two metrics?
Mark Hurd: Tony, thanks for the question. There was a lot of stuff in there, and it will probably take me a while to answer that as thoroughly as I could. Basically, we said we would be at a roughly 6% constant currency growth as the year started. To some degree, you have seen us actually perform better than we modeled in the first two quarters. I think that would be the way I would describe it. So I think from that perspective, I'm clearly pleased. I look at the Company's performance on two axis. One is incremental improvement in performance and the other is absolute performance. So I think, from an incremental perspective, we're pulling a lot of levers at the same time, which is what you see going on, which makes the landing of the guidance, to your point, the exercise we're going through right now, which is to line up our cost levers and our revenue levers. We have invested, so I don't want you to misunderstand. What you see in the quarter when you look at our OpEx is a series of investments. We invested in printer market share and we got it. We invested in going to market with different other market development activities in the PC business and we got it. So if you look at ISS growth, I think if you look at the market and you look at share positions by market, you're actually going to find we had a pretty strong quarter. It's really a combination of all those levers. If you asked me in the end, from where we started to where we are, am I pleased, the answer would be yes. Let me give you either answer. If you asked me, do I think we can do better than we've done? The answer would be yes. We certainly have opportunities. It's the reason we're making investments we are in the sales organization that we are, other investments in market development and why we still have a lot of cost work to go do across the Company. So we are a long way from done, and by no means am I coming to you today, telling you we're rolling a perfect game on every line. We have got a lot of work left to do.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Farmer - Merrill Lynch.
Richard Farmer: Thank you.  I would like to ask a question on the restructuring progress and the margin targets, please. I think last quarter, you said you were about 53% through the restructuring. If I heard you right, Bob, you said 10,000 cumulative headcount. So if my math is right, that's about 65% now. Is that the right way to think about it, so that maybe 35% or so is left to flow through? Mark, given that you are already a little above your long-term margin guidance, despite a seasonally weak quarter, despite the real estate savings coming, the data center savings coming, why shouldn't we have long-term margin targets going up significantly from here?
Bob Wayman: Let me start with the restructuring. Yes, you have interpreted the numbers right. About two-thirds of the headcount, the positions are gone from the Company. I do want to remind you that another part of our savings was the pension, which all kicked in, in early 2006. So you've got to play both variables separately when doing your calculations.
Mark Hurd: To your question, I'll have to go study those numbers closer. No, I have your view. We will, certainly, as we close Q4 and as we get towards the security analysts meeting that we have planned for December, certainly come to you with our best view of forward-looking margins. So I think that would be the timeframe, as opposed to today.
Operator: Our next question comes from Andrew Neff - Bear Stearns. Andrew Neff  - Bear Stearns - Analyst Sure.  If I could just follow up on the question talking about the different initiatives that you have, can you give us an update on where you are in the IT savings initiative, lay out how that will play out? Mark, you have talked a lot about the hiring efforts you are going to deploy. Can you talk about where you are in terms of the hiring efforts in bringing people onboard?
Mark Hurd: Sure. I won't give out numbers Andy, but I would say we have made a material dent in getting our hiring started. I'm actually pleased with it, because I think we took on a fairly sizable task. We did make a good dent in it starting in Q2 and we will follow on with in Q3. In terms of IT, we still a lot of work to do. We believe in our strategy. We have begun the work. We are a year into it, but at the same time, we still have plenty of work left to do. The work in IT will stretch out through 2008, so you've got clearly ‘07 and ‘08 to go. I wouldn't call it linear, but we do have a lot of work left to do, to get our IT to where we went to get it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harry Blount - Lehman Brothers.
Harry Blount: Back to the revenue growth side of the equation, the segment that really stands out to me is maybe being a little bit behind where maybe I would have expected to be would be on the services side. You have met your mid-point or so of your margin goal. I know you have a couple of big contracts kicking in, in the back half of the year, but what do you specifically have going on there? What should we be looking for over the next two, three, four quarters?
Mark Hurd: I think you're right in what you say. I take complete accountability for this. We really wanted to get our cost structure right. It was a major driver for us. even if it meant two things: one, that we didn't go after deals that we might have gone after before. Secondly, we have actually exited a couple with tremendous support from the customers, that weren't ones that we felt we could go on with. So those two things have caused what you have seen. Now, we have a strong pipeline, so that's good news. We're beginning to build back our pipeline, but we still won't sacrifice profitability for just taking bad deals to get revenue growth. I feel better about the pipeline. I think we're building that back up, and I think our focus on the cost structure will give us renewed ability to go win transactions, but win them the right way. So I do expect us to see ‘07 to have better growth than what you have seen in ‘06. So that's probably where I will leave it today, as it relates to the Services business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America Securities.
Keith Bachman: I wanted to talk about Software, if I could, for a second. Mark, you had pretty good growth there. If you could talk a little bit about what the organic side was? The margin was a little less than I was thinking. If you could talk about the margin expectations you have before you consolidate Merc, that would be great.
Mark Hurd: Keith, let me go back and start on the growth side. Growth was pretty similar across OpenView and OpenCall, so the organic growth was actually favorable across both of the different groups. So we got some benefit, of course, out of the Peregrine growth, but we had double-digit growth in both OpenView and OpenCall organically, so that was a good story, I think, on the top line across the board in software. On the bottom line, which I think is an excellent question, I think you've got multiple factors. You've got the additional cost structure we're working through with the Peregrine acquisition; that's certainly part of it. Secondly, they do get an impact from the bonus that hits across the Company. So because of the size of their business, that had some materiality in the bottom line, because that business is very sensitive, with a few million dollars to the bottom line. Then there is a slight bit of mix between the OpenCall factoring versus the OpenView factoring. So those are really the three drivers, when you net it out. I would say, if you balance those out, the business is roughly what we would have hoped for, from an operating margin perspective. It could have been a little bit better. Long run, where am I expecting? I still believe a business of this scale has the opportunity to be in the 17% to 20% ballpark of operating performance. Again, as we've stated, I think when you look at the combination of Mercury and our Software business, we have an opportunity by the time we get to ‘08 to blend these businesses together and have a 20% operating margin business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS.
Ben Reitzes: Mark, I'm not sure you have to apologize for anything on the revenue line, considering you're outgrowing IBM by 500 basis points and Dell by probably 2 this quarter. Can you keep it up? While you are I might add, not growing services intentionally. But can you keep it up? Can you keep gaining share? What are you going to do to make sure you do that into next year? Maybe if you want to highlight a few key segments.
Mark Hurd: Thanks for the comment. I think when you look at some of our nearest competitors in dollars, we did a pretty nice job from a growth perspective when you compare those numbers.  I think it's up to us to optimize our cost structure to make sure we can invest in the right segments. I do believe we can keep up the kind of growth that we're forecasting. That's why we're making the investments we're making. It's why I think the improvement in our cost structure allows us to get more aggressive in the market, as we see things that make sense. So to some degree, we're affected by the macro market, and we have to deal with those macro market movements. But within the context of a reasonable market, I like our opportunities to compete effectively to be in a good share position. So I think I would net it out to say, listen, I'm optimistic that we can show good revenue growth within the context of the segments we compete. So again, the only caveat I would give to that is the macro environment.
Operator: Our next question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: Thanks very much. I have two quick questions.  Bob, are you still targeting completion of your 15,300 headcount reductions by the end of the October quarter? Secondly, Mark, you mentioned that the demand environment overall was relatively steady. I think you called out U.S. consumer as an area that you are keeping a close eye on. But could you specifically address what you're seeing in Europe, given some of the reports that we have heard from other companies regarding weakness in June, and whether you feel like that's just typical seasonal, or whether there's something else going on there? Perhaps a quick comment on Federal as well?
Bob Wayman: First, yes, we expect to be virtually complete by the end of the Q4. There could be a few very small exceptions to that, but virtually complete.
Mark Hurd: Richard, as it relates to Europe, generally speaking, we had pretty balanced growth across the businesses. So if you look at it the way you asked the question, I would say that Europe was okay for us in the quarter, across most of our segments. That said, I’ll just to try to give you a little more color. There are multiple stories within Europe. So it's really not, I think, fair to go into a Europe-generalized discussion. We see strong growth in most of the Eastern European countries. That's a generalization, but it's a reasonable one to make. We see less so in Western Europe, and there's even stories within Western Europe, if I took you from the UK to France to Germany to Italy. So we don't really spend a lot of time looking at Europe in the aggregated context as we do spending time looking at the individual segments. There are stories within the story. When you net all of Europe together as an entity, it was okay in Q3 for us. But again, we have got to keep our eye on more sub-segments for us to really make sure that we make sense out of it.
Operator: Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia - Cowen and Co.
Louis Miscioscia: A question I wanted to ask was on the services area. In the past, I think you have mentioned that you were looking for acquisitions in software and services to fill in your product lines there. On the services side, do you think that you would be more focused on something that would add to managed services, IT infrastructure outsourcing? Or would it be something more in the consulting and systems integration area? Or it would be something different, in a BPO kind of application, or something maybe to enhance offshoring in something like India's software outsourcing?
Mark Hurd: I look forward to working with you, first. Second, I don't comment a lot on those kinds of things, in terms of forward-looking acquisitions. I think, fair to say that we're going to look at potential acquisitions that fit the following criteria: they strategically make sense for us, and service is certainly an important strategy for us, but they have also got to financially make sense. They have to operationally make sense for us. That means, for us, that we can run them, that we don't have to jeopardize the trajectory of the Company at the same time that we do it, et cetera, et cetera. So we really look at those three filters, and we will continue to look at them across those three filters as we go. But I would not try to pigeonhole us into one certain area in this phone call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Good afternoon. Can you give us some more details on IPG? Your results are basically the opposite of what we have heard from one of your close competitors. Then also, from Canon, we heard they are expecting 23% year-over-year in second half in laser. So it sounds like things are on track, but can you just give us some more color?
Mark Hurd: I think clearly our team has done well. I think it's a combination of things, Shannon. I don't think it's one thing. I think it first starts with just pure technology and the product offering itself. I think when you look at the releases we have had, the technologies just kept coming. It has really been impressive, so that's point one. Point two, I think we've done a lot of work to try to optimize our go to market. There has been a lot of work done with in-store promotion. There has been a lot of work done with promotion overall, with merchandising. I think that has been a real strong move as well. Thirdly, we continue to try to improve our ability in our go to market model, as it relates to even our human capital. So we're putting more people in the enterprise, et cetera. So I think it's a confluence of technology. I think it's a confluence of our ability to improve our go to market. When you look at some of the service statistics that are coming out about our Printer business, it's a combination of good improvement on the service side. It's no one thing, but I think the team overall has done a nice job.
Operator: Our next question comes from Brian Alexander - Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Thank you.  Just to follow up on the question on PSG, obviously at the high end of your margin target in a seasonally weak quarter, just wondering what you saw in terms of pricing from Dell? Obviously, they have talked about getting more aggressive. Have you noticed any change in their tone? If you look at the operating margin expansion versus a year ago, obviously there's a lot of levers I think that cause that. But could you help us rank the consumer mix shift in notebook,  attach and you talked about warranty. What were some of the primary drivers of that margin expansion?
Mark Hurd: Sure. My answer to your second one would mostly be yes, but let me start with the first one. Let me go into a broader comment on competition in PSG. We did not see an extraordinary competitiveness in the market. Now, I say that against the backdrop of this has always been a competitive market. So I can't say I saw a less competitive market, but we didn't see an extraordinarily more competitive market in our Q3. So that would be the way I would describe your question. That's a broader answer across multiple geographies and obviously multiple competitors. As it relates to the levers, you're right on all of them. The big levers here are, first, we are working on the cost structure of the whole company. That certainly helps PSG. Bob mentioned to you strategic buys and our ability to look at our procurement processes and our ability to improve our leverage as it relates to cost of goods sold. Certainly, that's a lever. You already mentioned the warranty lever; that's certainly an important lever as it relates to the integration of our service go-to-market with our cost of goods sold and our product software, which is a big lever for us. Certainly, the other one for us is just attach and growth and growth of attach. So, when you look at those levers and our ability to leverage that, certainly that last piece with our partners, those are really the levers that we pull. I think you have seen them manifest themselves in Q3.
Bob Wayman: Let me just add that we have certainly seen profit improvement on the consumer side of the business, but also on the commercial side of the business. It's not just the growth on the consumer and notebook that has benefited this business. Of course, PSG, like all of our business, has benefited from the cost reduction, expense reduction efforts around the company. So everybody shares somewhat in those reductions as well.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Wong -  A.G. Edwards.
David Wong: Thank you very much. One detail and then a question. The detail, when you talked about components and the strategic opportunity in components, can you give us some idea of what type of components these were, and what timeframe those buys occurred? Secondly, when you were talking about trading off some profitability to get growth in specific areas in the current quarter, can you tell us which areas you are going to target for growth, going forward, where you would like to see slightly higher growth than you're getting at the moment?
Bob Wayman: Let me began with the first detailed question. A variety of categories of components, but the top of the list is panels. Once again, that's an area that we depend upon very heavily in our notebook business, and we have had some good opportunities, not only this quarter, but over the past several quarters, to buy panels at the right point in time. It includes processors, chipsets, just about everything, occasionally, that we go out and buy more than what the schedule says we should be buying. It has occurred throughout the quarter.
Mark Hurd: One more thing. We're not going to try and gain share just so we can gain share. We're going to go out and try and do things that makes sense in businesses that can bring us a long-term benefit, so places where we can get long-term margin expansion will be where you'll see us invest.
Operator: Our next question comes from  Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Securities.
Bill Fearnley: On IPG, should we be thinking about the operating margin range now in 14% to 16% versus the previous 13% to 15% guidance, with unit growth in the teens? Then, what about the threat of third-party remanufactured ink and toner on the supplies business? Any change in your view on the supplies threat there? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: I'd say you should not do anything other than what we have told you in the past, that this is a 13% to 15% kind of business, 4% to 6% revenue growth kind of model. I think you've seen the inter-relationship between unit growth and supplies growth, and you can see by the supplies growth how feel about the supplies market and how it's performing. So I think what you've seen is the business performed basically in the ranges we have described. It's 14.2% this time. It was 13% this time last year. You look at the unit growth rates, you can see that we had, going into this quarter, blended 8% unit growth over the last rolling four quarters. We have now posted a 15%. So I think you're going to see us continue to operate in those ranges. Now, the only caveat I would give to that is when we see opportunities, as we have talked about our strategy, we'll take advantage of those opportunities in high-usage segments to be appropriately focused in how we go to market. So again, I would give you no change from what we said before.
Operator: Our next question comes from Cindy Shaw - Moors & Cabot.
Cindy Shaw: I wanted to ask about the Enterprise hardware business. Blade servers,  one of your competitors doing quite well. Another competitor that used to tout its blade server growth now saying blade servers don't matter. Also, Bob, you had talked last December about stock options. I think you said that there were two waves where a lot of options went in the money, one low 20's, one low 30's. It looks like we may have both those waves behind us. If you can comment on the outlook on how that could impact share count going forward?
Mark Hurd: First, we think blade servers are important. When you look at the virtualization of servers, which we think is where it's headed, blades are critical to that. We feel great about our blades announcement that we did in the early part of the summer. We had another good quarter in terms of growth in blades, and we're very focused on it going forward.  Our C-class blades will really just be out in fiscal fourth quarter. So we think it's an important segment, and we feel well-positioned within it.
Bob Wayman: If you look at the outstanding options, there's still a bubble around the low 20's, and another bubble right around 29 to 32 in terms of number of options that are outstanding, as well as those that are vested. So we have been at or above those ranges now for a while. What is really hard to predict, of course, is how the employees will behave. That's a function not only of what the stock price is, but what they think it is going to be. So we will just have to see it plays out. Obviously, along with that, as we go quarter by quarter, there will be more vesting of some of those waves of options as well. That typically occurs in the spring time, when another prime vesting period occurs. So we will just have to see.
Operator: Our final question comes from Dan Renouard - Robert Baird.
Dan Renouard: My question is on the Enterprise business. You mentioned some areas very strong, specifically blades and then the XP and EVA and storage. What areas were weak or concerns you have? Is it getting more competitive? Or, said another way, are there deals you're walking away from in this area as well?
Mark Hurd: Let me just make sure I'm clear. You're talking about specific to the Enterprise, what markets are getting more competitive? I think that's what you asked.
Dan Renouard: Yes, and what areas were weak? You've mentioned some areas that were very strong. What areas were weak for you, or areas that you think you can improve upon?
Mark Hurd: Sure. Well, you saw by our numbers, right? You saw what happened in BCS, which was a decline in revenue year-over-year. I think our business really reflects what we see going on in market trends. Back to Cindy's question, you see a definite change in what we think is mainframe architectures and UNIX architectures and lots of people going to virtualized servers, which does mean lots of blades. You need lots of software management around those blades technologies and the virtualization of storage at the same time. So that's where you see the growth. You look at the growth numbers, and they say that things are going to more industry-standard platforms. You see growth in our ISS business, you saw growth in our blades business, growth in our EVA line, our XP line. You see growth in our software business, which is really the binding fabric that brings many of those things together in the Enterprise. Things that are not growing in the Enterprise, things like tape, proprietary UNIX, what I would describe as more of the older architectures. We have a piece of that, as you can see in our portfolio. So, as I said before, I think, in the Enterprise, we feel pretty good about where we think the Enterprise is headed. I think it reflects itself in what you see in the numbers as they show up quarter after quarter. So let me say thanks for your questions. Before wrapping up, I would like to summarize the call by saying that I am pleased with our execution in the third quarter. We posted strong revenue growth, we expanded margins while gaining share in key segments and we generated strong cash flow from operations. We drove investments and saw success in strategic initiatives from hardware units and commercial print offerings in imaging and printing to consumer and mobility and personal systems, to blades and external arrays in the enterprise. We continue to make progress in our cost structure. We made further progress on strategic conditions that will strengthen HP's long-term competitive positioning and increased non-GAAP EPS guidance for the fourth consecutive quarter. All in all, it was a solid quarter for HP. I will leave my comments at that, and I will thank you again for joining us on today's call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

===== 2006 Q2  (2006-05-17 16:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to your Hewlett Packard second quarter 2006 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today’s conference, Mr. Brian Humphries. Please proceed, sir.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Carlo, and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to welcome you to our second quarter earnings conference call. Joining me today is our CEO and President, Mark Hurd, and CFO Bob Wayman. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that this call is being webcast live. The webcast and the second quarter earnings slide presentation, including non-GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on the HP Investor Relations page, under company information, at hp.com. A replay will also be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the second quarter. However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. I encourage you to read the risk factors described in the company’s annual report on form 10K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, the company’s quarterly report on form 10Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2006, as well as other SEC reports filed after that form 10K. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items discussed at the company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including in process R&D, amortization of good will and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges, and net investment losses. The presentation of GAAP financial information for the present quarter and fiscal year to date, and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the financial statement accompanying today’s earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations page, under company information, at hp.com. Finally, and with a view to allowing time for multiple questions, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications. With that, I will turn the call over to Mark Hurd.
Mark Hurd: Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our second quarter results. We posted solid revenue growth. We controlled costs and expenses. We expanded margins, and we generated record cash flow. This was another solid quarter in a long-term plan, and while we clearly have more work to do, we are building a stronger, more competitive HP. Financial highlights of the quarter included revenue growth of 5% year over year, or 8% in constant currency. Operating margin expansion in key businesses with personal systems margins at 3.6%, image and printing margins at 15.5%, enterprise storage and servers margins are 7.5%, and HP service margins of 8.9%. Operating margin of 8%, up from 6.1% the prior year period. Non-GAAP EPS at $0.54, representing growth of 46% year over year, and cash flow from operations at $3.6 billion. During the quarter, we also made progress on key initiatives, including completing the comprehensive review of our Enterprise sales coverage model, with a goal to create more demand for HP products and services. This is an area where we can make more progress, and we are determined to strengthen our customer relationships, and in doing so, expect to gain a greater share of their IT budgets. We will do so by increasing the number of HP sales people calling on our largest global customers, which will benefit demand for HP, and for our channel partners. As part of this, we have already started to build out our sales force, both in the Enterprise segment and in the commercial printing market. This investment, which will take place over several quarters, will allow us to take better advantage of market opportunities by increasing the frequency in which we touch our customers and provide greater customer satisfaction. At the same time, 1600 positions were eliminated as part of our restructuring program that will improve our call structure and allow us to become more competitive. As you will recall, most of the reductions associated with our restructuring program are non-customer facing. Turning to the business segments, Imaging and Printing had a solid quarter, with revenue growth of 5% year over year, led by supplies growth of 10%. Commercial hardware growth of 4%. Consumer hardware revenue declined 8% from the prior year period. Segment operating profit was $1.04 billion, or 15.5% of revenue, reflecting gross margin expansion and expense discipline. Over the past year, we have taken steps to strengthen the financial and competitive position of IPG, through disciplined expense management, technology innovation, and targeted acquisitions. These actions have strengthened our core printing business where units have grown 8% over the past four quarters, and allowed us to enter and compete in adjacent markets, such as photo kiosks and the photocopier market. We continued to see solid momentum in our growth initiatives in the second quarter. Color laser unit shipments increased 38% year over year, and printer-based MFP shipments grew 44% as we continue to see demand exceed our expectations. HP Indigo press saw printed page volume growth of 42%, led by new product introductions. In terms of our core printing business, we shipped approximately 12 million units in the second quarter. Unit growth slowed to 3% year over year, given a tough comparable, and our continued focus on targeting unit growth in the areas of high supplies consumption. We do expect unit growth to accelerate in the second half as we drive more promotional activity. We will continue to focus on investing in growth and profitability going forward through our commitment to research and development, targeted share gains, and the building out of our commercial printing sales force. We continue to see 13% to 15% operating margin as appropriate for this business. Personal systems continued to post solid results, with revenue up 10% year over year to $7 billion. During the quarter, shipments grew 16% over the prior year period with double-digit unit growth in our consumer and our commercial businesses, and in every region. Market growth continues to be led by the shift to mobility, strength in emerging markets, and consumers. These secular trends are clearly playing to our strengths, and in the second quarter we grew notebook shipments 48% year over year. We also saw strength in our consumer business, with shipments up 30% over the prior year period. The momentum is showing up in market share results. In the first calendar quarter, and according to preliminary estimates, HP gained 1.4 percentage points of share year over year on a worldwide basis, and 2 percentage points in the United States. We continue to post solid margin expansion in personal systems, with second quarter operating profit of $248 million, or 3.6% of revenue, up from 2.3% in the prior year period. Given our focus on reducing our cost structure, coupled with our strength in notebooks, strong international presence and consumer presence, we are confident we can continue to show the appropriate balance between revenue growth and operating margins. However, I will ask you to bear in mind that the third fiscal quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter in personal systems. Enterprise storage and server revenue grew 2% year over year to $4.3 billion. Within ESS, industry standard server revenue grew 4%, with strong growth in blades, where revenue increased 60%. Revenue in storage grew 8%, with ongoing strength and external arrays, where revenue in our high-end XP and mid-range EVA offerings grew 8% and 46% respectively. Business critical systems revenue decreased 7% year over year, with Integrity server revenue growth up 93%, offset by revenue declines in PA risk and Alpha. Enterprise storage and servers posted a strong second quarter operating margin of $322 million, or 7.5% of revenue, up from 4.3% in the prior year period, led by margin expansion and disciplined expenses. We have been focused on driving margin expansion in Enterprise storage and server and we are pleased with the progress we have made. However, we need to do a better job driving growth, and you will see us take actions in the form of pricing and go to market initiatives. As part of this effort, we are currently reviewing our Enterprise sales model to better understand our sales account coverage and deployment. We have room for improvement, and you will see us adding more resources in our large accounts to ensure better coverage and to serve our customers better. Revenue in HP services declined 2% year over year to $3.9 billion, reflecting the impact of currency and a focus on profitability improvements. Excluding the effects of currency, revenue in HP services grew 2% year over year. Within HPS, and on a year over year dollar basis, revenue grew 2% in managed services and declined 4% and 2% in technology services and consulting and integration, respectively. HPS reported operating profit of $345 million, or 8.9% of revenue, up from 7.3% in the prior year period, reflecting margin expansion and expense discipline. We saw margin expansion in all businesses within HP services, and I am pleased with the continued progress we are making in managed services and in consulting and integration margins. We remain focused on driving operational improvements in the business. As we head to the second half of fiscal year ’06, we will continue to focus on reducing our costs via labor management and efficiency measures, as well as process standardization and automation. This cost structure discipline and margin expansion will allow us to be more competitive in the market in fiscal year ’07, and you should expect to see a pick up in revenue growth rates in ’07. Revenue in software grew 20% over the prior year period to $330 million, with revenue in HP OpenView and HP OpenCall increasing 25% and 11% respectively. HP OpenView growth was fuelled by solid momentum in the business associated with Peregrine acquisition, which adds key assets and service management components to the HP OpenView portfolio. Software reported an operating profit of $3 million, or 1% of revenue. Although I am pleased that we got off to a good start with the Peregrine integration, and that it is our third consecutive quarter of profitability, we have to improve on operating performance. Software is strategic for HP and we are focused on driving margin expansion to levels more consistent with the profile and the size of this business. I am going to leave my segment comments at that for today. With that, I would like to turn it over to Bob.
Bob Wayman: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin with a review of the performance of our financial services business. Revenue for HPFS during the quarter was $518 million, down 5% year over year and up 4% sequentially. The year over year revenue decrease reflects lower used equipment sales and declining financing volume, which decreased 14% year over year and 7% sequentially. Portfolio assets increased 1% year over year and sequentially. Operating margin was 7.5%, down from 10.7% in Q2 of last year, and 7.7% in Q1. Bear in mind that operating profit last year was aided by the reversal of approximately $16 million of reserves relating to certain aged receivables. We are focused on re-accelerating volume and revenue growth by making appropriate investments in our financing sales force, while continuing to balance the risk profile of the portfolio, which remains in very good shape. Before getting into the key elements of the P&L, let me remind you that fiscal 2005 results, including cost of sales, operating expenses, operating profit, net income, and EPS, did not include the impact of FAS 123R stock-based compensation. Consistent with last quarter, to assist you in comparing results versus prior periods, we have included a quarterly historical EPS trend in the financial tables accompanying the earnings release. This should allow you to view the results as though all stock-based compensation had been included in previously recorded results. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.54, including approximately $0.03 from stock-based compensation, up from $0.37 a year ago, which again, excluded the impact of FAS 123R. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.51, which included $97 million, or $0.03 in after tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results. The majority of the adjustments relates to the amortization of purchased intangibles. A quick update on restructuring. During the quarter, approximately 1600 positions were eliminated, related to the July announcement, bringing the cumulative total to about 8100. Revenue of $22.6 billion for the quarter was up 5% year over year, and up 8% when adjusted for the effects of currency. On a regional basis, revenue was up 10% in the Americas, down 2% in EMEA, and up 7% in Asia Pacific. When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 9% in the Americas, 6% in EMEA, and 10% in Asia-Pacific. Gross profit was $5.6 billion for the quarter, or 24.8% of revenue, up from 23.8% a year ago and 23.2% in Q1. Gross margin improved year over year and sequentially in each of our non-financing business segments, reflecting improved operational effectiveness in key areas, such as option attach, delivery efficiency, utilization, and discounting. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled $3.8 billion for the quarter, or 16.8% of revenue, down from 17.7% a year ago and up from 15.7% sequentially, reflecting normal seasonality and the implementation of our annual salary adjustment, effective February 1, versus prior year implementations on May 1. Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 1% year over year and 6% sequentially. The year over year cost of currency increase reflects employee bonus accruals this quarter, given the improved financial performance of the company, as well as the accelerated effective date of salary increases. Non-GAAP operating profit was $1.8 billion, or 8.0% of revenue, up $478 million year over year and $92 million sequentially, despite the inclusion of approximately $120 million of stock-based compensation in the current period. Non-GAAP other income and expense, plus pre-tax income of $157 million, or roughly $0.04 per share after tax, above the $0.02 per share we had estimated coming into the quarter. The excess reflects significant currency gains during the quarter, but following significant currency losses in the prior quarter. OI&E primarily consists of net interest income, which is somewhat predictable in nature, currency impacts, which are more volatile, and one-time items such as gains or losses on land and building sales, which are difficult to predict. Given projected cash and debt levels, and our expectations for currency, we estimate non-GAAP OI&E to be about $0.03 to $0.04 per share per quarter for the remainder of FY06, which primarily reflects baseline net interest income. We will call out deviations from this baseline as appropriate. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 20.5% for the quarter, slightly above the guided number of 20%. Going forward, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 20% for the remainder of FY06. Next, the balance sheet. HP owned inventory came in at $6.8 billion, up $304 million year over year and $47 million sequentially. Inventory days of supply stands at 36 days, up from 35 days last year and sequentially. We will continue to actively manage inventory and are comfortable with the current levels across each of the businesses. Regarding channel inventory, we continue to be pleased with management of channel inventory in all of our businesses in both weeks and dollars. ESS and PSG ended the quarter at roughly four weeks, and IPG at five weeks, while channel inventory dollars were at appropriate levels across the board. Trade receivables ended the quarter at $9.8 billion, up $517 million year over year and $1.1 billion sequentially, in line with normal seasonality. DSO now stands at 39 days, flat year over year and up from 34 days sequentially. Next, property plant equipment was down $318 million year over year, and essentially flat sequentially at $6.4 billion. Gross CapEx was $521 million, down 8% year over year and up 22% sequentially. On a net basis, CapEx was $401 million dollars, up 6% year over year and 25% sequentially. Net PP&E, as a percentage of revenue, now stands at 7.2%, down from 8.0% year over year and flat sequentially. Coming into FY06, we expected full-year gross capital expenditures of $2.8 billion, and net CapEx of $2.2 billion. We assumed CapEx would be heavily weighted to the second half of the year. We remain roughly on track with capital spending in IT in our product segments. However, given the slowdown in financing volumes within HPFS, earlier capital expenditures may be somewhat less than our initial expectations. Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 53 days, up from 47 days year over year and 46 days sequentially. Next, a few comments on cash. Cash flow from operations was excellent, at a record $3.6 billion for the quarter. Free cash flow, that is operating cash flow less net CapEx, was $3.2 billion, up 62% over last year. Year-to-date cash flow from operations is very strong at $5.5 billion, up 39% year over year, and free cash flow was $4.8 billion, up 52% year over year. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.3 billion in stock and paid $226 million for our normal dividend. In addition to our open market share repurchases of approximately 40 million shares, we received approximately 7 million shares under the prepaid variable share repurchase program that we entered into last quarter. So a total of 47 million shares were acquired during the quarter. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of $14.1 billion, down from $14.5 billion year over year, and up from $12.0 billion sequentially. On to weighted average shares outstanding, our weighted average shares outstanding declined slightly to 2.887 billion from 2.893 billion in Q1. Going forward, we expect weighted average shares outstanding to remain roughly flat, with potential increases or decreases dependent on our continuing share repurchase activities, HP stock price, option exercise patterns, and common stock equivalents. Now a few comments on our outlook. On a constant currency basis, revenue typically declines approximately 4% to 4.5% from Q2 to Q3. In recent years, we have been negatively impacted by currency from Q2 to Q3. Assuming exchange rates stay roughly where they are today, and taking into consideration our hedging strategies, we expect revenue to benefit from currency somewhat sequentially. However, given the rate used in Q3 of ’05, and the heavy contracts that we have entered into, we do not expect a significant year over year currency benefit in Q3. In addition to currency movements and seasonality, our guidance takes into consideration the current competitive environment, which contains some uncertainty, particularly related to pricing dynamics. Taking all of these factors into account, we estimate Q3 ’06 revenue to be approximately $21.75 billion, and full year FY06 revenue to be approximately $91.0 billion, in line with current consensus analysts’ expectations. Regarding earnings, our results this quarter reflected good operational effectiveness and progress on several key initiatives. Offsetting this, let me remind you that Q3, as you know, is always a tough quarter for us. Our mix includes a significant portion of revenue from Europe, as well as the consumer segment, both of which are seasonally weak in the third quarter. Further, as Mark indicated, we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives, which include building out our Enterprise sales force both in the Enterprise segment and in the commercial printing market. The process of selecting, hiring, and deploying these resources will take time, and the associated costs will ramp accordingly. As such, for FY06, we expect these investments to impact Q4 more heavily than Q3. With that in mind, we now expect Q3 ’06 non-GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.48, which includes approximately $0.03 of stock-based compensation. For total year FY06, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $2.04 to $2.08, which includes approximately $0.13 of stock-based compensation. With that, we will take you questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with UBS Warburg.
Benjamin Reitzes: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about pricing, Mark. What is in your guidance and thinking for pricing with regard to the PC market, as well as what you said about the Enterprise market, that you are going to make some pricing investments. In particular, you know we are all thinking about what Dell may do or may not do, and if you could make a comment on that particular situation, we would appreciate it as well.
Mark Hurd: Sure, I will give you the best I can. I mean, we -- first of all, let me make a statement. We are very focused on running a good business. Share for us is, while important, it is not the primary driver of how we think about the business, so we really do think about the business in the context of the improvement in overall profitability and our ability to be able to deliver great products and great services while we do it. We have seen continued aggression, so I do not think Q2 was much different than what we have seen over past several quarters in terms of aggressive price points, so we factored that into the model that we have given you in terms of Q3 guidance. So the best I can tell you is in our Q3 guidance, both in the context of ISS and in the PC market is, our best view, where we have seen the market not only in Q2 but where we sit it in Q3, and given our emphasis as I described.
Benjamin Reitzes: Have you seen the market get more aggressive as we went throughout the quarter, or you thought it was pretty steady?
Mark Hurd: The only difference I would say, Ben, is that it has just always been aggressive. I hate to give you that answer, but it was an aggressive market in Q2, and we expect it to continue to be. So if your question is did I see an accentuation point at the tail end or somewhere in there, no, I did not see that, but I do not want you to take that as meaning -- this is an aggressive marketplace, and it has been aggressive for a while.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Ben. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Rich Farmer with Merrill Lynch.
Rich Farmer: Thank you. Mark or Bob, on the restructuring progress, last quarter, I think you said you were about 40% of the way through the restructuring. If I heard you correctly, Bob, you said 8100 positions, I guess against the target of 15,300. That implies around 53%. Is that the right way to think about it? In other words, how much of the restructuring is complete in terms of the actions as well as the flow-through to the P&L? Given, Mark, that you are already at your previous long-term margin target at 8% here, does that not suggest that the margin targets need to go up?
Bob Wayman: Let me start with the restructuring. Yes, your understanding is approximately correct. I would only remind you that it is very much affected by the geographic mix of people and all of that, so you cannot just take the number of headcount and come up with the right answer. Let me remind you that our overall cost savings included the benefit plan changes, which are already fully reflected now in our run-rate in Q2. So that part is fully behind us. We are 53% done with the headcount reductions. So there is still some work to go.
Mark Hurd: Yes, and a majority of that is in Europe, and as Bob’s point, some of the early parts of the savings came in the early part of the year with the pension cuts as he described. On the model, I gave you my Q3 and back-half of the year, and we will have to see how the rest of the year goes and how things unfold. Clearly we still have a lot of work to do here, Richard. I mean, you have mentioned it just in your statements. We have part of our restructuring left to do. We have hiring to do as it relates to our ability to be able to cover the accounts in the market the way we would like to be able to grow our revenue over time. So I think before we go delivering any new models, let’s get through Q3 and Q4 and see where we land.
Bob Wayman: Q2 is just one quarter. It is not the full year, so we gave you ’07 guidance. We were talking about full-year guidance, which takes into account weaker quarters like we seasonally expect in Q3.
Mark Hurd: One last one on Q3, when you look back over history here, Q3 is not a strong quarter for Hewlett Packard. So let’s get through Q3 as we have described and we will talk about the ’07 after that.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Richard. Next question, please, Operator.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: Thank you. I was wondering if you might be able to provide any additional detail on the impact, the headcount impact of the ramp-up of the commercial sales force. In other words, how many people are you planning on hiring and over what time frame? Are there any other changes in the coverage model that you intend to make? Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Sure. I will try to give you some color. I am not going to give you numbers, other than to say I feel that we are under-covered, and it is not under-covered to the tune of 25 to 30 people, or I would not bring it up. For us, it is a significant movement and it requires -- I will tell you it is in the hundreds that we need to hire. We will hire as quickly as we can, but I would only remind you that it is in the context of we need quality people, people that can do the job, that have experience in this area. So as a result, it is not as simple as us just going out and putting a sign out or putting an ad out and hiring people. So we are going to go do the hard work to make sure we hire quality people and attract the best people in the industry. It is also important for us to assimilate them and to train them, so for a period of time, we not only will bear the expense, we will not have gross margin from them as they get productive, and that can take, in some cases, six, nine, ten months once they get hired. So again, we have factored that into the guidance that we have given you for Q3 and Q4, which we would expect to have some of that headcount in place with frankly no productivity from that headcount.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Richard. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Rebecca Runkle with Morgan Stanley.
Rebecca Runkle: Good afternoon, thank you. Just a quick clarification, if I could, Mark, on software. If I recall, you were looking for continued improvement quarter to quarter in the software returns. You alluded to some of what happened in the quarter, but I am hoping that you could provide a little bit more context and clarity, and then what specifically you are doing, if anything, in addition to what you have already laid out, to get that to ramp the way you would like to see it?
Mark Hurd: Sure. Thanks, Rebecca. Well, we need to get the break-even point down, so real simple -- the break-even point here at 327 is not acceptable in terms of a break-even point. For us in the quarter, there were a couple of factors that occurred. There was a mix factor that occurred, in terms of more OpenCall as it related to OpenView, which had some mix impact on margins. We certainly had to take into consideration some of the expenses associated with the Peregrine acquisition. Both of those things, if you will, raised our break-even point. For us, Rebecca, this business is more important than a $1.3 billion software business. It is strategic to us in many dimensions and strategic to us financially, from a growth perspective and the way it aligns with the rest of our business. We are going to go get this business performing the way it should. I think you should expect to see us continue to drive on operational improvements in software.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Rebecca. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Andrew Neff with Bear Stearns.
Andrew Neff: Thank you. Could you go into a little more detail about what is going on in Europe? That has been an historical area of strength. Even if you take out currency, it was underperforming to the other regions. Could you talk us through what you are doing there and how you plan to address some of the issues in Europe? And maybe just a general comment about demand trends in different geographic markets?
Mark Hurd: Sure. I would be glad to take a little bit. Bob can add some color to it if he would like. It is a mixed bag, Andy, would be the way I would describe it. There is good growth in Eastern Europe. So when you go into the Eastern Europe segments, you would see growth that you would feel very good about it. Clearly our growth in areas like Russia and other places has been strong. When you go look at it on a dollar basis, our growth in traditional western European countries has not been exciting. It has been flattish kinds of numbers, and the numbers differ a little bit by country. Now, when you get into a constant currency basis, all those numbers go up a bit, obviously, because we have affected several points of currency. I would describe it as Eastern Europe, pretty healthy, Western Europe, pretty blah. Certainly some effect on currency affected. They are not any different, Andy, than I feel about the rest of the company. As good as we are in Europe and as big as we are in Europe, and as important a player as we are over there, we are under-covered in Europe as well. We just have work to do, as we do across the rest of the company.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Andy. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Tony Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Tony Sacconaghi: Thank you. Your revenue guidance for next quarter is about 4.8% year over year revenue growth. I know you said you would not get much benefit from currency, but even if you got a little, you are really guiding to 4% to 4.5% revenue growth versus the nearly 8% that you did this quarter on a year over year basis. Can you help explain what went into that? You mentioned a little bit of caution about what might happen on the pricing side in PC's. Is there anything else that is -- and again, this is year over year, so there is nothing to do with sequential seasonal patterns -- is there anything else that you are cautious about? Was there anything about the linearity in the quarter or what you were seeing in the Enterprise business that appears to be making your guidance somewhat conservative? Quite frankly, even for the year, currency has flipped around pretty nicely, and yet you retained the revenue guidance for the full year, despite the fact that currency has become much more favorable.
Bob Wayman: The guidance that we have given, Tony, is right in the middle of the 4% to 6% kind of range that we have provided for the overall company. There was no particular trend within Q2. That is to say, we did not see any change in trend in the month of April. There are just, in general, reasons to be cautious. We just heard a question about Europe and the weakness there. We had a lot of comment around what some of our competitors are talking about. So we think it is prudent to set a number that we feel solidly about.
Mark Hurd: Tony, we hope we do better. We will be clear with you on that, but when we look at what is out there -- first of all, at least for a part of Q3, we are not going to get much benefit from currency, given our hedging strategies. Some of it also is, take the euro, for example -- where is it going to land? We do not have a crystal ball on that either. I think we will see where we land. We think we are right in the middle. We have been saying we want to grow the company in the range that we have described. We think we are right in the middle of that guidance with what we are given here today.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Tony. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Bill Shope with JP Morgan Chase.
Bill Shope: Thank you. Your printing margins have broken out of your targeted range now. I think earlier in the call you said you planned to increase promotional activity to stimulate unit growth in the second half of the year. Should we assume that this means you are going to try and reinvest some of the upside versus your targeted range of 13% to 15%, to reinvigorate the install base?
Mark Hurd: We have had 8% unit growth over the past rolling four quarters. I think again our strategy is to target high usage segments for that unit growth, so you should think of us continuing to try to operate in that range of 13% to 15%. Looking to reinvest is appropriate, again to stimulate the install base, especially in the appropriate segments. We are not trying to lead a pricing war or anything like that. We are just trying to make sure we target the right segments. I think at the same time, you have seen the benefits of that in what has shown up over the past couple quarters. I would tell you that the IPG story is kind of a multi-prong story. I mean, the work that has been done in transformation of the business from a cost and expense perspective has been good work, done over the past several quarters. Certainly what we have done at the rest of the company has helped, and certainly our unit growth has helped over the past rolling four quarters. We think we will continue that. We think we will see accelerating unit growth which will have some effect on margins as we go, and we think we are roughly doing what we told you we would do.
Bill Shope: Your promotional activity will not change from a prior action?
Mark Hurd: It will depend on the market and depend on the segment. Again, we will obviously monitor demand and monitor pricing as we go. I think you should expect us to be well-positioned, certainly in those high use segments, but I would not call anything we are going to do extraordinary, at least with our current plans.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Bill. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Laura Conigliaro with Goldman Sachs.
Laura Conigliaro: Thank you. With Intel recently indicating that everything is on the table for review, how confident are you that Itanium will ultimately not end up on the cutting board? What, if anything, is plan B should Intel actually put an end date to its Itanium involvement?
Mark Hurd: I have no indication, nor do I want to speculate on anything like that, Laura. I think we have had no indication of Intel -- in fact, I think the last big Itanium discussion we had was Paul Otellini and I out in the marketplace, talking about the investments we are making together in the Itanium eco-system, both across Intel and Hewlett-Packard. We continue to try and grow our Integrity server line. I think the best medicine for any of that is for us to go out in the marketplace and scale the business and grow it.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Laura. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers.
Harry Blount: Quick strategic question -- the number one issue that I consistently hear from investors is can HP continue the momentum on the revenue growth side of the equation once we get past some of the cost-cutting. Mark, you have alluded to increasing the coverage. But as I take a look at the software and services business, could you potentially comment on some of the other levers that you are looking at pulling on the revenue growth side, broadly, and then a little bit more detail specifically on the software and services?
Mark Hurd: Sure. Frankly, the levers kind of integrate, Harry. For us, we really work on optimizing our cost, and taking cost out of other things and putting in things that help us grow. So we are doing a lot of work, as you know, in areas like IT and areas of corporate overhead, and realigning those dollars into areas that can help us grow the company. Certainly sales coverage is a part of that. We think there is a lot of market uncovered.  I have given you kind of the cost side of going out and building that out, but the opportunity for us is significant, if we are successful over the long term in being able to drive more market share. I think that market share, when you have our situation -- just to be very open with you, sales as a discipline is not the hallmark of the company. We are an engineering-driven company, and we are very good at it. We build great technology at Hewlett Packard, and we just have to build the same kind of discipline and capability in our Enterprise sales capability and go to market model that we have in that other aspect of the company. I think we will be able to go do that, and I do think that effects growth. At the same time, when you talk about services, there is a direct correlation between services, cost, and leverage, the integration of software, automation of processes, and our ability to scale out our services business. Back to my point earlier, if you have too much cost, you cannot compete for multi-year transactions. You have to get your cost structure in line because you get it multiplied when you have a flaw in your cost model. It gets multiplied multiple times over multiple years. For us, it is very important to get our corporate cost right and to get our cost within services right. One of the ways to do that is to automate processes, which is what we are doing through our integration of OpenView into our service delivery process. That puts us in a better strategic position to go grow the company. Harry, the way you should think about it is us trying to get our cost right to be able to continue to invest in unit and commercial printer market share, to get our sales force right both in commercial printing and in the Enterprise sales growth discussions that we described earlier, to continue to drive on getting our services business lined up, even from a cost perspective and automation perspective, so we can go to the marketplace and grow. We are focused equally on getting our cost right and growing the company.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Harry. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: I just wanted to ask a question about the cash flow. It is obvious that it is strong this quarter. How should we think about cash flow as we go through the remainder of the year? Also, that segues into, obviously, use of cash questions. Share repurchase dividends are already there. Any thoughts on more acquisitions? Thank you.
Bob Wayman: In terms of the rest of the year, there is not a lot that we expect to be different from the first half to the second, other than, as I indicated, capital spending will be a little back-end loaded. If you are looking at free cash flow, we would expect a little uptick in capital spending. Frankly, all of the working capital measures that we are looking at right now seem to be in line with where we want them. I do not expect huge changes as we move into the second half.
Mark Hurd: To your question on the use of our cash, I think you hit the right levers. Obviously we have been and we will continue to be active in the repurchase of HP shares. We will continue to look for acquisitions that are strategically aligned with where we want to take the company. You have seen us make acquisitions in storage and in services and in blades over the past several quarters, in IPG.  We will continue to look in those areas for things that make sense for us. Again, we are not going to go after an acquisition just to spend money. It is going to have to be an acquisition that aligns to where we want to take the company strategically.
Brian Humphries: Okay, Shannon, thank you. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Cindy Shaw with Moors & Cabot.
Cindy Shaw: Thank you. I would like to go back to the topic of revenue growth. It has been much better in the last two quarters than we had seen for a number of years before-hand. Mark, you laid out in the December analyst meeting, a number of basically tactics and strategies for doing that. Is that kicking in already, or have we got other elements that are helping the revenue growth in the last six months?
Mark Hurd: Cindy, as I indicated, I think what you have seen is good work in terms of our ability to align our costs and our ability to go put that into the market and have it work for us. Certainly you have seen that in our unit growth and in IPG. You have seen it show up in PSG, to a degree. We have work to do in the Enterprise sales force. This not only hits PSG but also hits IPG. For us, we need to be able to do a better job in those accounts from a coverage perspective. I would say, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, some of that work has not kicked in, and that is work that we have to do to be able to go source and hire, assimilate, and train the people. I would say we are pulling some of the levers. I would actually argue some of those levers we are pulling quite well. We have to make sure we are pulling all of them as we look forward into the future.
Cindy Shaw: So is it fair to say the mobility plan is going pretty well for you then?
Mark Hurd: I think you saw our strength in notebooks in the quarter was good. Certainly when you are up 48% when you look at the units, those are big numbers. Particularly, it is not like we are growing off a small base, either. I think even in IPG, while I wish we had a little bit more unit growth, we certainly were coming off one of our strongest quarters a year ago. I think we were like 12% unit growth prior year. Again, to your point, it is very important for us to get our cost right so we stay as competitive in the marketplace as we can. We also have to get the sales force thing going our way. That is going to take us some time to get that right, but I am confident we have a shot.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Cindy. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Bill Fearnley with FTN Midwest Securities.
Bill Fearnley: Mark, a quick question for you regarding the channel. When you talk about increasing the sales staff, should we expect a change in the direct and indirect sales mix? Does your view change as you look at GEO’s? Does your view of the channel change here as you cross your one-year anniversary at Hewlett?
Mark Hurd: That was one of Brian's rules, to not ask a multi-part question, but I will do my best to deal with that. I think the channel is a key asset for us. I think they are in a lot of places that we cannot get to. They give us a lot of support. We have all kinds of different channel partners across different segments across different geographies, so it is hard to generalize about them. But if I were to generalize, I would call them an asset. Has my view changed since I got here? Not really. We are continuing to try and align our channel compensation to channel performance. We believe that to be working, and feel good about our alignment in that respect. Should you take any of my comments in terms of the building out of the direct Enterprise sales force as some message to the channel? No. I think the message you should take to the channel is we are going to go create demand for Hewlett Packard, and that is going to be an opportunity for our channel partners to get more demand at the same time. We are not making a fulfillment directive by what we are doing with our folks. They are going out to create more demand for HP and that is going to benefit the channel as much as it is going to benefit any of our direct functions.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Bill. Next question, please.
Operator: Sir, our next question is from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
Chris Whitmore: Good afternoon. Couple questions, hoping first of all to get more color on the deceleration in unit shipments and the printer space. Is that a broad based market phenomena, etc.? Tied to that, I was a little surprised to see inventory increase sequentially entering the summer slowdown. Could you give us any color on the inventory on your balance sheet? Thanks.
Bob Wayman: Let me start with inventory. We feel very good about the inventory position. We did increase what we call our strategic inventory, our strategic buys in PSG. This is focused on areas where we want to assure supply at good prices. So there is a bit of an uptick that is not seasonal in nature, but that is really the only area of inventory that is going a little differently than what one would normally model.
Mark Hurd: To Bob’s point, you are going to see us -- where we think it makes sense -- do spot buys like Bob described, but I would not take that as some other kind of inventory message at all. In IPG, I think the question is a bit more complicated, and without trying to get into a ton of detail on this call, we are targeting high usage segments, so we give you an overall unit growth number as opposed to a unit growth number by segment. Take my comments to mean I am pretty pleased with what IPG did in the quarter from a unit growth perspective. I would have liked to have seen more unit growth, but I would not interpolate totally the three, because there is some low usage segments that we frankly do not get as aggressive in, depending on what is going on in the marketplace. Again let me message one more time -- we do expect accelerated unit growth in the back-half of the year in IPG.
Brian Humphries: We will take one more question, please.
Operator: Sir, that question is from the line of Keith Bachman with Banc of America.
Keith Bachman: Hello, just under the wire. [inaudible] to be talking a bit about the…
Bob Wayman: Keith, I am afraid we can barely hear you. Could you speak up, please?
Keith Bachman: Yes, can you hear me now, Bob?
Bob Wayman: Much better, thank you.
Keith Bachman: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the PC dynamics in terms of trying to separate out some of the opportunities or revenue growth that you had in the quarter from the U.S. versus the international market, and how, if any, the pricing dynamics differed there, because again, this actually relates back to Dell. I am just trying to understand what the future may hold here if Dell gets more aggressive on pricing.
Mark Hurd: You know, the best way I can describe it, Keith, is it was pretty balanced overall. It is pretty balanced overall -- that is the best I can give you. I cannot come up with a tremendous difference in geography. As I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had strong growth across really all geographies, and that is the way we saw it.
Bob Wayman: If you look at ASP's for personal systems, overall year over year we saw a 5% decline in ASP's, which is really very similar to what we saw in Q1. So there is just no news there. If you look at it by region, I am not going to give you the exact details, but there is not much deviation around that 5% by region.
Mark Hurd: There is just not much there, Keith. I mean, we had double-digit unit growth in every region. That is about all I can give you on it.
Keith Bachman: Okay. Bob, is there any color you can give us on what the spot-buy was? What was that product?
Bob Wayman: It was in a few areas, but the largest once again was in panels.
Mark Hurd: Thank you, Keith. Thank you very much. I appreciate all of your questions. Before wrapping up, I want to summarize today’s call by again saying I am pleased with HP's second quarter results. We posted solid revenue growth. We controlled cost and expenses, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. The quarter represented another solid quarter in a multi-year plan. While we clearly have more work to do, and we know that, we are well on our way to building a stronger, more competitive HP. While we have to get after that work, I think we will continue to align our expenses and continue to optimize our investments in growth, we are encouraged with our progress to date. I will leave my comments at that, and again, thanks for joining us for the call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today’s conference with HP. This concludes your presentation and you my now disconnect.

===== 2006 Q1  (2006-02-16 15:45:00) =====
Operator: Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hewlett-Packard First Quarter 2006 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Jane, and I will be your coordinator for today.  At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference.  If at anytime during the call, you require assistance, please press "*" followed by "0", and a coordinator will be happy to assist you.  As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Brian Humphries, Vice President of Investor Relations.  Please proceed sir.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Jennifer.  Good afternoon everyone.  I would like to welcome you to our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call.  Joining me today is our Chief Executive Officer and President, Mark Hurd, and Chief Financial Officer, Bob Wayman.  Before we get started, I would like to remind you this call is being webcast live.  The webcast and the first quarter earnings slide presentation including non-GAAP reconciliation tables that can be accessed on the HP Investor Relations page under Company Information at HP.com.  A replay also will be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is provide you with information regarding the first quarter.  However, some of our statements and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially.  I encourage you to read the risk factors described in the Company's annual report on form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, as well as subsequent SEC filings after our form 10-K for an understanding of the factors that may affect the Company's businesses and results. I would also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items discussed at a company level are sometimes expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and therefore have been adjusted to exclude certain items, including in process R&D, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and net investment losses.  A presentation of GAAP financial information for the present quarter and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP are included in the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations page under Company Information at HP.com.  Finally, and with a view to allowing time for questions from multiple firms, please refrain from asking multi-part questions or clarifications.  With that, I will turn the call over to Mark.
Mark Hurd: Thanks Brian.  Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.  I am pleased with our first quarter results.  We delivered solid revenue growth with some of our key businesses coming ahead of plan, and we controlled costs and expenses and posted strong cash flow from operations.  And we are on track with our plan to strengthen our management team, implement our restructuring plan and reduce our cost structure.  And we are refining our sales model and hiring in key areas to take advantage of the opportunities in the market. Financial highlights of the first quarter included revenue growth of 6% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency.  Operating margin expansion in key businesses with Personal Systems margins up 3.9%.  Imaging and printing margins up 14.9%, Enterprise Storage and Servers margins of 7.7%, and HP services margins at 7.8% as well as total company margins.  Non-GAAP operating profit of 7.5%, up from 6.2% in the prior-year period.  Non-GAAP EPS growth of 30% year-over-year, and cash flow from operations of 1.8 billion. We also made progress on key initiatives including the further strengthening of our management team with key hires in sales, services and software.  The extension of our imaging software and storage offerings with closure of Scitex and Paragon acquisitions, and the announcement of a definitive claim to acquire Outer Bay, a leading provider of archiving software for enterprise applications and databases.  And the elimination of a further 1,800 positions as part of our restructuring program as well as the change to our U.S. pension and post retirement plans.  We are pleased that our initiatives are on track and results are showing up in both the topline and in our margins.  However, we know we have more work to do, and we know we can do better.  We have growth opportunities to pursue and to fund, and we need to remain disciplined in terms of our costs. Turning to the business segments.  Imaging and print had a solid quarter with revenue growth of 8% year-over-year, and segment operating profit of 973 million, or 14.9% of revenue.  Over the past few quarters we've taken steps to strengthen IPG's position in the market with cost actions aimed at reducing our cost structure to allow us to be more competitive in the market, targeted pricing actions to drive market share gains in areas of high supplies consumptions, new product innovations such as our scalable print technology, and targeted acquisitions that extend our leadership in adjacent growth markets.  These actions have begun to pay off with supplies growth of 11% in the first quarter and strong IPG profitability.  We also continue to see strong momentum in the market with total shipments of 13 million printers in the quarter, growth of 12% over prior-year period.  Consumer hardware revenue grew 1% in the quarter with printer unit shipments up 10% led by 20% growth in all-in-one shipments and strong acceptance of HP's scalable printing technology. Commercial Hardware revenue increased 6% year-over-year with printer unit shipments, up 18% led by color laser shipment growth at 36% and printer based MFP unit shipment growth of 40%.  HP Indigo digital press volume grew 43% year-over-year.  You should expect us to continue to focus on balancing growth and profitability going forward, delivering profitability in the 13% to 15% range and investing in install based growth and hardware and supplies innovation.  You will also see us continue to target investments at the adjacent growth areas such as managed print services and commercial printing, and new and emerging business opportunities as well.  We are in the process of building out our sales force to take advantage of these opportunities. Moving out of Personal Systems we continue to show a balanced approach to revenue growth and margin improvement.  First quarter revenue grew 8% year-over-year to a record 7.4 billion with solid growth across all regions.  During the quarter shipments grew 16% year-over-year with double digit unit growth in every region, and particular strength in both consumer and commercial notebooks as well as workstations.  Over the past few quarters growth in the market has been fueled by the shift to mobility, strength in emerging markets and consumer. We are pleased to be well position to take advantage of this with a strong lineup of consumer and commercial notebooks, a significant exposure in strong competitive position in emerging markets, and a solid relationship with the retail and commercial channel which is essential for both emerging markets and the consumer business.  In the first quarter and on a year-over-year basis revenue grew 26% in notebooks and 18% in consumer clients.  We also continued to post strong growth in emerging markets with unit shipment growth of 68% in India, 62% in Brazil, and 49% in Russia. Segment operating profit was 293 million or 3.9% of revenue representing our highest operating margins in many years.  Margins continue to benefit from topline strength, strong momentum in consumer and improved execution against various operational efforts.  We are pleased with the ongoing improvements we are seeing at PSG and will continue to focus on executing well against the operational levers as well as continuing to reduce the cost structure of the business.  However, topline will be seasonally weaker in the second and third quarters given consumer mix and the traditional European holiday season so you should expect this to be reflected in PSG margins. Enterprise Storage and Servers had a solid quarter with revenue up 5% year-over-year to 4.2 billion, and operating profit of 326 million or 7.7% of revenue.  Within EES industry standard server revenue grew 6% over the prior year period and continued strength in server blades where revenue grew 58%.  Revenue in Storage grew 4% with ongoing strength in external raise where revenue in our high-end XP and midrange EVA offerings grew 14% and 28% respectively.  Business critical systems revenue increased 1% with Integrity server revenue up 94% offset by declines in PA-RISC and Alpha. We did close the quarter with approximately 7,000 ISP applications reported to HP Integrity, double the number over the prior year period, and we are investing funds and resources to expand this in the year ahead.  Over the past few months we've extended our storage and server offerings with the acquisitions of ApplQ, RLX and most recently the announcement that we signed a tentative agreement to acquire Outer Bay.  We are determined to drive greater success in the enterprise through our ongoing execution and cost discipline as well as targeted R&D and acquisitions.  We are also hiring in key areas and refining our enterprise sales model to ensure we have the right skills in place to take advantage of these market growth opportunities. Revenue in HP Services declined 2% year-over-year to 3.8 billion reflecting the impact of currency and a focus on profitability improvement.  HPS reported operating profit of 293 million or 7.8% of revenue.  Within HPS revenue declined 2% in technology services, 1% in consulting and integration and managed services as well.  Excluding the effects of currency HPS grew 3% year-over-year.  We remain focused on lowering our cost to service delivery to allow us to compete more aggressively in the market.  Until then you should expect to see us remain disciplined in terms of deal times.  This and the impact of currency will challenge HPS topline growth in fiscal year '06. Turning to software, revenue grew 29% to 304 million led by growth in OpenView and OpenCall, up 34% and 19% respectively.  During the quarter we strengthened our software offerings with the acquisition of Peregrine which adds key asset service management components to the HP OpenView portfolio.  Software reported an operating profit of 9 million or 3% of revenue, representing a second consecutive quarter of profitability.  Given the model improvements we are making and the cost actions we have in place to further reduce the breakeven point of the business, we should begin to see further improvements in software margins in the coming quarters.  I am going to leave my segment comments at that and turn it over to Bob for more on the financials.  Bob?
Bob Wayman: Thanks Mark and good afternoon everyone.  Before I get into the numbers, I want to briefly touch on a financial reporting item.  Each year as part of our first quarter annual financial review, we make minor changes between the reported segments results that reflect organizational shifts between the businesses.  Under accounting rules we are required to report our segment results is totally consistent with our internal reporting.  As such any changes that we make to prior period results internally must be reflected in our external results as well.  This year the changes are immaterial in size and primarily reflect revenue shifts at the GPU level beneath the segments.  At the segment level only ESS and software are impacted with quarterly revenue and operating profit fluctuations of no more than $5 million. However, in the interest of complete disclosure we thought it was appropriate to mention them at the start of this call.  A detailed bridge on these changes including historical data is available on our Investor Relations website as well as furnished on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC.  I want to be very clear the changes do not impact HP’s previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or EPS.  So view this as an annual fine tuning of our financial reporting structure to better align it with business changes. With that, a quick review of the performance of our financial services business.  Revenue for HPFS during the quarter was $496 million, down 11% year-over-year and 4% sequentially.  The revenue decrease reflects lower used equipment sales and declining financing volume, which decreased 10% year-over-year.  The volume declines were primarily driven by softness in Asia Pacific and select European countries.  Portfolio assets decreased 2% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially.  Operating margin was 7.7%, down from 8.1% in Q1 of last year and 10.1% in Q4.  However, within our guided range of 6% to 8% margin for the business. The risk profile of the existing portfolio and the trend for delinquency rates are in good shape.  Going forward, we'll focus on returning the business to appropriate levels of volume and revenue growth while continuing to manage the portfolio for acceptable levels of risk.  In order to give you better visibility into HPFS financials we have provided a supplemental slide in the earnings presentation which includes depreciation, change in financing and receivables, and the net capital expenditures for HPFS. Before getting into the key elements of the P&L, let me remind you that fiscal Q1 '06 results including cost of sales, operating expenses, operating profit, net income and EPS reflect the inclusion of FAS 123R stock-based compensation while prior period results do not.  Also, stock-based compensation is held at the corporate level and not included in segment results.  To assist you in comparing results versus prior periods we have included quarterly historical EPS trends in the financial tables accompanying the earnings release.  This should allow to you review the results as though all stock-based compensation had been included in previously reported results. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.48 including approximately $0.03 from stock-based compensation, up from $0.37 a year ago which again excludes stock-based compensation.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.42 which included 166 million or $0.06 in aftertax adjustments that were not included and in our non-GAAP results.  The majority of the adjustments relates to the amortization of purchased intangibles.  Quick update on restructuring.  During the quarter approximately 1,800 positions were eliminated related to the July announcement bringing the cumulative total to 6500. Now to the P&L.  Revenue of 22.7 billion for the quarter was up 6% year-over-year, and up 8% when adjusted for the effects of currency.  On a regional basis revenue was up 10% in the Americas, 1% in EMEA, and 6% in Asia-Pacific.  When adjusted for the effects of currency, revenue was up 9% in the Americas, 8% in EMEA and 9% in Asia-Pacific.  Gross profit was 5.3 billion for the quarter or 23.2% of revenue, up from 22.9 a year ago, and down from 23.5% sequentially.  Year-over-year gross margin improvements in EES, PSG and software were partially offset by gross margin declines in IPG and HPS. Non-GAAP operating expense totaled 3.6 billion for the quarter or 15.7% of revenue, down from 16.7% a year ago and 15.9% sequentially.  Adjusting for currency effects expenses were up 2% year-over-year and down 2% sequentially.  We will continue to focus on further operating expense improvements while investing in areas to drive future growth.  When looking forward bear in mind that historically operating expenses increase approximately 4 to 5% in constant currency sequentially from Q1 to Q2. In addition, we implemented our annual salary adjustment effective February 1st which will negatively impact operating expenses and gross margin on a sequential basis.  In FY '05 similar salary adjustments were implemented effective May 1st.  The change and timing this year was made to more closely align merit based salary increases with the end of our fiscal year.  Non-GAAP operating profit was 1.7 billion or 7.5% of revenue, up 369 million year-over-year, and down slightly sequentially despite the inclusion of approximately 140 million of stock-based compensation in the current period.  Non-GAAP OI&E was pre-tax income of 38 million or roughly $0.01 per share after-tax below the $0.03 a share we had estimated coming into the quarter.  The decrease reflects currency losses during the quarter following significant currency gains in each of the last two quarters and losses on non operational property sales. As I indicated last quarter, currency dynamics within OI&E and one-time items such as land and building sales are difficult to predict.  However, given projected cash and debt levels and our expectations for currency we are reducing our estimate for OI&E to about $0.02 per share per quarter for the remainder of FY '06.  We will call out deviations to this baseline if and when they occur.  Our non-GAAP metric 20% for the quarter, in line with guidance. Next, the balance sheet.  HP owned inventory came in at $6.7 billion down 389 million year-over-year and 146 million sequentially.  Inventory days of supply stands at 35 days, down from 39 days last year and flat sequentially.  Overall we continued it make good progress in inventory management across each of the businesses.  With regard to the channel inventory, we ended the quarter in good shape across the board with ESS and IPG at roughly five weeks and PSG at four weeks.  Further, IPG sale inventory dollars were down year-over-year and ESS dollars were flat.  PSG dollars were up slightly reflecting increased revenue and PSG channel inventory weeks were down both sequentially and year-over-year. Trade receivables ended the quarter at 8.7 billion flat year-over-year and down 1.2 billion sequentially in line with normal seasonality.  As a percentage of revenue trade receivables were 9.9%, down from 10.6% year-over-year, and from 11.4% sequentially.  DSO stands at 34 days, down from 36 days last year and 39 days sequentially.  Trade receivables are in good shape particularly given revenue performance for the quarter. Next, property plant equipment was, down $344 million year-over-year and 105 million sequentially to 6.3 billion.  Growth, CapEx was 427 million, down 26% year-over-year and 18% sequentially.  On a net basis CapEx was 322 million, down 23% year-over-year and 28% sequentially.  Financing assets accounted for a significant portion of CapEx during the quarter.  Net as a percentage of revenue now stands at 7.2%, down from 8.2% year-over-year and 7.4% sequentially.  Despite the low level of CapEx in Q1, our full year capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged and we expect total CapEx of 2.8 billion and net CapEx of 2.2 billion in FY '06.  Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 46 days, up from 45 days year-over-year and down from 52 days sequentially. Next, some comments on cash.  Cash flow from operations was 1.8 billion for the quarter, despite significant bonus payments and approximately 152 million in payments related to our restructuring activities.  Free cash flow, that is operating cash flow less net CapEx, was 1.5 billion, up 34% over last year.  During the quarter we repurchased $1.4 billion in stock and paid 227 million for our normal quarterly dividend.  In addition to our normal open market share repurchases, we entered into a prepaid variable share repurchase program with an investment bank during the quarter. Under the terms of the program, we prepaid 1.7 billion in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of our common stock over an approximate one year term of the transaction.  The price at which we purchased the shares are subject to a minimum and a maximum as determined under the terms of the agreement thereby effectively hedging our purchase price.  For modeling purposes it is important to understand the actual number of shares purchased will be determined over the course of the program and that the shares will only come out of our share count periodically over the life of the agreement as our purchase transactions are settled.  Given the level of share repurchases and the prepayment transaction entered into during the quarter our Board of Directors authorized an additional 4.0 billion for share repurchases and total remaining authorization is just over that amount. We closed the quarter with total gross cash of 12.0 billion, down from 13.6 billion year-over-year and 13.9 billion sequential.  The decrease in cash balance primarily reflects the prepayment and repurchases of common stock as well as 653 million in net cash payments for acquisitions, bonus payments and restructuring payments.  Our weighted average shares outstanding declined slightly from Q4 to 2.2 billion, 893 million.  Going forward, I expect weighted average shares outstanding to remain at approximately 2.9 billion with the potential for some variation quarter to quarter.  This expectation takes into account our continuing share repurchase activities, HP stock price and our current expectations for option exercise pattern and common stock equivalents. Now a few comments on our outlook.  On a constant currency basis revenue typically decreases up to 1% from Q1 to Q2.  Now, in recent years we have benefited from currency movement sequentially from Q1 to Q2 which more than offset typical constant currency decreases.  Assuming exchange rates stay roughly where they are today we expect revenue to decline for normal seasonal patterns.  As such we expect revenue of 22.4 to 22.6 billion in Q2 '06 or year-over-year constant currency growth of 6 to 8%.  For the full year FY '06 we continue to expect an adverse currency impact of approximately 2 to 3% and now expect revenue of 90 billion to 91 billion. Regarding earnings there are several factors to consider.  Our results this quarter reflected balanced performance across our portfolio and we are ahead of plan in certain businesses.  In addition, we will continue to execute on our restructuring plan throughout FY '06.  Offsetting these factors as previously mentioned operating expenses typically increase sequentially and we will see the impact of the annual salary adjustment in Q2. Mark noted that we will continue to fund investments to drive long-term growth initiatives.  Further, we are now expecting roughly $0.02 per share in OI&E versus previous guidance of $0.03 per quarter.  With that in mind, we now expect Q2 '06 non-GAAP EPS of $0.47 to $0.49, which includes approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of stock-based compensation.  For FY '06 we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.90 to $1.95, which includes approximately $0.13 of stock-based compensation.  While We are not going to give Q3 and Q4 guidance today, let me remind you that Q3, as you know, is always a tough quarter for us.  Our mix includes a significant portion of revenue from Europe as well as consumer.  Both of which are seasonally weak in the third quarter.  As you build your models for the rest of the year, keep many mind this seasonality adversely impacts both revenue and earnings in Q3.  With that, we'll move onto your questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir.  Ladies and Gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please press "*" followed by "1" on your touchtone telephone.  If your question has been answered, or you wish to withdraw your question, please press "*" followed by "2".  Please press "*" "1" now to begin.  Your first question comes from the line of Harry Blount with Lehman Brothers.
Harry Blount: Thanks, guys.  Mark, the principle question I get from investors is typically focused on how HP is going to continue to drive the margin improvement excluding the cost cutting that's going on there, and I know you have a number of initiatives underway, so I was hoping you could maybe talk about some of the progress you're making and where you feel real good about the prospects going forward.
Mark Hurd: Well, I think for us a lot of it is about mix, Harry.  For us how we deal with mix both across the Company as well as within the product lines and the attached themselves are really big deals to us, Harry, as you know, so We are putting a lot of energy in the places that we think have significant margin opportunity for us across the Company, but also within the context of businesses like PSG and ISS where we can bring with that other things that attract more margin either in the attach of options or other opportunities that bring more services and other products with them. Secondly, there is also a significant number of other operational levers that we can pull as it relates to our supply chains, it relates to warranty, it relates to revenue also a big part of our portfolio and how we incent and align our channel partners and how those relate to the various factors I just described, so it is mix within the Company.  Software and services obviously play a key mix in that.  Mix within the product line, aligning to attach.  Supply chain levers like what I described.  All around cost of goods sold, warranty, etc..  It's mix within contra, et cetera.  There are a fair amount to go on, but, Harry, I would also caution that we are we've got a lot of work to do here.  Both in the context of there is a lot of opportunity, but there also is a lot of work for us to do at the same time.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Harry.  Next question, please, operator.
Operator: Your next question is from Richard Farmer with Merrill Lynch.
Richard Farmer: Thanks.  Mark, I think, or maybe Bob had mentioned you're a little bit ahead of plan in the segments of restructuring, and we've seen operating margins already at the high-end of the long-term target range in IPG, PSG and DSS.  Can you help us quantify how far you are along in capturing the restructuring savings into the P&L and how much there is left going forward to be realized?
Mark Hurd: No more than what we said.  I think, Richard, you were really faint in your question, but I think I got the spirit of it.  I would say we are roughly on track with our restructuring activities.  As we said before, it would be a six quarter kind of process, that certainly takes into consideration we have some regions and some geographies that are frankly a little bit more difficult to get through.  I would also add to you we have chosen to tackle those as opposed to not tackle them.  We knew going in they would be hard work, and they've proven to be all of that.  We are going to go get it done, and it is going to take us time to get all of that accomplished, but within the context of what we had originally described and I think the schedule we gave you earlier is roughly the right schedule.  In terms of us coming out with new operating margin parameters for '07, that's not where we are today, where we are is in the ranging that we described and I think the answer to your question on restructuring is on track.
Bob Wayman: Richard, just to clarify, my comments about a couple of businesses being ahead of plan was not specifically related to restructuring.  It was just in the quarter.  They performed a little better than we had assumed going into the quarter.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Richard.  Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes.  Thank you.  I just have a question about currency and how you're factoring that into your guidance.  I think the center point of your revenue guidance year-over-year is 4.3% revenue growth.  Bob, you said 6% to 8% growth at constant currencies.  Are you expecting a minus 2 %to minus 4% hit year-over-year in currency in Q2 and then related to that, what was your expectation for year-over-year currency impact for Q1? We know it came in at minus 2%.  Can you tell us what your expectation was at the beginning of the quarter?
Bob Wayman: Hang on just a moment, Tony.  I think the 6% to 8% you're referring to was a Q2 number.  I am sure it was.  So the full year, yes, we still believe 2% to 3%.  You may recall in December when we talked to you we were talking about a couple of percent full year currency impact.  Yes, Brian is just confirming here the 6% to 8% was indeed a Q2 number.
Toni Sacconaghi: Right.  The mid-point of your Q2 guidance as reported is for 4.3% revenue growth, so the implication is for Q2 you're expecting a negative year-over-year currency hit of minus 2% to minus 4%? I just want to confirm that.
Bob Wayman: That is correct.
Toni Sacconaghi: What was your expected currency impact for Q1 because if anything year-over-year Q1 looks about as hard as any other quarter, and you're expecting 2% to 3% for the year, what was your expectation for Q1 at the beginning of the quarter?
Bob Wayman: It was in the 2 % to 3% range.
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Toni.  Next question, please.  Your next question is from Laura Conigliaro from Goldman Sachs.
Laura Conigliaro: Yes, thank you.  This is a continuation of a couple of questions that were already asked, but it really is getting more specific on it.  Can you give us a sense maybe a percentage terms or otherwise how much of the just reported quarter earnings actually came from restructuring and also how much of your targeted FY '06 earnings you actually look to come from restructuring and then maybe a somewhat better explanation if you could on what happened as far as the Enterprise group, that is despite an easy compare you had weak stores revenue growth and also decelerated ISS revenue growth.
Mark Hurd: Okay.  Laura, lots of questions.  Let me try to tackle a few of them.  I will let Bob grab a couple of them.  On storage I think there is a mixed story within storage.  We want to keep in mind that we had pretty strong growth as it related to EVA and the XP.  When you look at EVA growth in the quarter of 28% and when you looked at growth of 14% many XP, I think if you look at that against the you're going find those are pretty strong growth rates overall, so I think that's encouraging part of the story.  I think in the tape part of our business we've had flattish kind of performance overall. Now, that's really a mixed story within storage.  I would say our storage growth on the non-tape products was very strong in the quarter and we are encouraged by that.  On the ISS side, it is depends which way you want to look at the story.  Clearly 6% growth you have got to look at it also in the context of the overall performance of the business.  You see it at the ESS level and I would tell you the business has been very strong in terms of its ability to attract attach and its ability to improve on the margin line, so when you look at it overall, I would say it is a fairly balanced story across ISS.
Bob Wayman: Let me try on restructuring.  As I indicated 6,500 people have left on the restructuring program, so that's 30% to 40ish percent of the total we expect.  There is still more labor cost reductions we will expect going forward.  Another big part of our announcement back in July was the changes to the U.S. retirement and retiring medical plans and that is largely reflected in Q1.  That is almost 100% already reflected in Q1 and will be fully reflected in Q2 and beyond.  That part of it we've captured already.
Laura Conigliaro: Thank you.
Brian Humphries: Question, please, operator.
Operator: Your next question is from Richard Chu with SG Cowen & Co.
Richard Chu: Thank you, very much.  I note your supply revenue growth in IPG was 11% easily the best in any quarters.  I wonder if you could give us some sense of how that was achieved.  How transient, how sustainable that level of ascension is, and any difference you can describe between the consumer and commercial businesses or Inkjet and LaserJet businesses? Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Well, I think again there isn't a lot of, the best way I can describe it is we tried to let the printer business and the IPG organization go out to the marketplace and make some moves that we think are appropriate relative to our opportunity to go scale the business, so I think when you go look at our unit growth, it is a fairly clear story.  We are sitting here in Q2 of 12% growth.  We had kind of 9% to 10% unit growth in Q3, and then we followed that up with 8% in Q4 and 12% here, and what we tried to do is really target our actions at high consumption segments that we think relate to your point, a supplies growth opportunity in the future, and I think that's really what happened. I think your point is it sustainable, we will have to continue to do the work we've been doing, so I think that's one dimension of it because I think if you can see by previous quarters back if you go a couple years back, there is a fairly strong inter-relationship between what happens on units and the segments that the unit growth comes out from and what happens with supplies growth going forward.  So I think that's one dimension of it, Richard.  I think in addition to it you are going to see us make some investments particularly in our demand creation model to put more effort into creating demand particularly in the commercial printing space and in the Enterprise where we think we've got a very strong technology position, but we have to go make some level of investment to be able to go pursue the opportunity, so I tried to answer as many of your questions as I could.  I tried to answer as many of your questions as I could.  I think we feel good about the improvement of the business.  I still think you should model a 4% 4% to 6% revenue growth for the business that will behave within the range of 13% to 15% operating performance and we think those are appropriate ranges to be modeling as we go forward and I do mean 13% to 15% in the model that we are describing.
Bob Wayman: Richard, just on supplies itself, we saw improved growth rate on both Inkjet and Laser supplies.  It is not just one, and as you see in the information packet we put out there, we are seeing good unit growth in both commercial and consumer space.
Richard Farmer: Thanks very much.
Brian Humphries: Question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes with UBS.
Ben Reitzes: Hi, yes.  Good afternoon.  Thanks.  Mark, you have, Hello?
Brian Humphries: Yes, Ben.  Go ahead, please.
Ben Reitzes: Mark, you have an interesting problem that you're already at the lower end of your 2007 operating margin target at 7.5%.  With only, I am going to take another crack at this, but with only 40% of restructuring done, how can we not assume that that 7.5% to 8% for '07 is a very conservative forecast.  Sorry to push on this.  But it seems like the key question.
Mark Hurd: Ben, it is fine to push on it.  I understand the math and appreciate it.  I think for us we've got a number of things to go do at the same time.  We clearly are adjusting our cost trajectory to your point and we have more work to do to get that trajectory to where we want to go, to Bob's point to how much work is left in our restructuring.  At the same time I would like to emphasize we are trying to adjust our demand creation model which means for us that there are some targeted areas where we will spend more money.  I go by the theory you don't go spend a lot of money to create a product to purposely under distribute it, so we actually have a theory that we would like to get into the marketplace and participate in a bigger part of the market which causes us to make some investments. I think when you go look overall for us, we will be taking more cost out to your point.  We will take some portion of that as we described way back in the restructuring.  I think you have to deal with some of the timing of this as we optimized the mix going forward, and I certainly think long run this is very much in the best interests of HP, but we do have some investments to make as we do take some of this cost out.  As it relates to some of the short term issues, I think you have to deal with some of the seasonality benefits in certain businesses that exist in Q1.  We had some mix shifts that are going to go on within the businesses and demand generation that I described.  I think there are a number of stories here.  Don't take any of that away from HP, Ben.  I am pleased with the performance of the Company in Q1.  I don't want to come off in any way to put a cloud on this, but we just still have a lot of work to do to get the place optimized and we know we can long run do better than We are doing.
Ben Reitzes: Thanks a lot, Mark.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Ben.  Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from Richard Gardner with Citigroup.
Richard Gardner: Thank you.  Well, nobody asked the demand question yet.  Maybe Mark you can give us your qualitative assessment of demand for each of the various regions you're operating in and in particular address comments from some of the distributors here that January was a little quiet in terms of demand and whether that is something that's concerning to you or something that HP even saw out in the marketplace? Thank you.
Mark Hurd: Everything concerns me, to be frank with you.  When I look across our macro demand picture without getting into every geography in the sake of time, Richard, I would call it roughly steady.  I can tell you, I could tell you stories by country.  I could tell you Western Europe is a little less exciting than Eastern Europe.  I could tell you that we saw very strong growth in the emerging markets.  China and India were exceptionally strong and now we are starting to compare against very large comparisons in markets of China.  It is no longer emerging.  It is emerged and we still have very strong growth rates there. I think steady would be how I would describe it.  We certainly saw some stories within the story.  Now, on the channel side, we finished with as about macro basis across HP about a strong a channel inventory position as we have.  When I look at the comparisons across product and regions, it is a very strong story, so for us we feel good about that piece of it.  Inventory overall, very strong for the Company.  So we continue to monitor, Richard, as things go, but I would say when I net all of that out about emerging countries, this geography, this product segment, this channel inventory being strong for us against the Company, the best answer I can give you with the data I have is pretty steady overall from a demand picture.
Richard Gardner: Mark, if I could, any comment on the linearity of this of demand in the quarter, specifically this idea of some down tick in January?
Mark Hurd: Nothing that I can really drive to you on.  Clearly within the quarter you had the holiday season and some other factors, but I wouldn't say anything in the quarter that I can, may be Bob can comment, nothing I would say would give necessity dramatic pause to tell you there was something in this week or that week or this month that I would point to, no.
Bob Wayman: Pretty normal seasonality within the quarter.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Richard.
Richard Gardner: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew McCullough with Credit Suisse.
Andrew McCullough: Thanks.  Mark, question on the software side.  The acquisition strategy here recently has been geared to the smaller type company.  What's your appetite for doing something a little bigger on the software side and where are you with respect to hiring a new head of software?
Mark Hurd: Okay.  We did hire a new head of software.  We announced that a couple of weeks back.  He actually starts next week.  It will be his first day on the job.  So, we have hired the new head of software.  His name is Tom Hogan.  We think he is a great addition to HP's management team, and we are really encouraged by that.  In terms of acquisitions, I think if you see what we've done, what we've done is really to acquire companies that had very strong technology that would further enhance our portfolio that we also thought were manageable operationally and things that could work within the context of improving our business, so that's what we've done, and I think that's the right strategy for HP.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Andy.  Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from Keith Bachman with Banc of America Securities.
Keith Bachman: Hey, guys.  On the Services side, obviously, Mark, a little degradation there in the growth rate.  You alluded to the fact that growth would, I can't remember the word, but would be compressed or something going forward.  Can you talk about what you're doing there that would detract from the growth rate and given the growth rate I was also a little surprised that margins weren't bumped up a little bit more.  Can you talk about the tension between what you hope to accomplish by compressing the growth rate and the implications to margins, please?
Mark Hurd: Yes, I think that there is a couple stories within there, Keith, to be very blunt with you.  First, we knew going in we were going to compress the growth rate.  That was purposeful.  There clearly are deals in the marketplace.  But we have got to make sure our discipline in right in terms of the deals we go after and that we go after deals that not only we can make money on but that we can deliver appropriately to the customer.  We are doing that.  It is a very big hallmark of HP that we execute on deals, but we have to make sure we execute for the customer at the same time we have a transaction that we can make money from. We put a lot of pressure on the way we look at deals and the discipline the way we look at deals, the way we look at costs, et cetera, et cetera and we have actually walked away from deals to be very blunt with you that says We are going to get out of a deal we are already in provided we can do that within the context of a great relationship with the customer going forward, and make sure we don't bid on things that don't make sense for us long run.  Secondly we are working hard on costs and we have been successful and I expect us to continue to be successful in changing the cost trajectory many HP Services as well.  I would remind you that we are having to add into HP Services the bonuses that we pay and the reason we do that is because it is an appropriate part of the cost structure that exists in that as business as well.  There actually is cost coming out as we do it, so I think you should expect for the short term that trajectory to continue with our belief that in the long-term the better cost position that we have and the better discipline and the better alignment we have in terms of our service delivery methodology which We are investing in standardizing in positions us very well to grow the business long run.  We still think when you net it out overall 4% to 6% revenue growth rates, the ability to drive operating margins in the 8 % to 10% range is the appropriate destination for the business.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Keith.  Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from Bill Shope with JP Morgan Chase.
Bill Shope: Okay, great.  Thanks.  Can you give us some commentary on the pricing environment in the Enterprise segment? We've seen some evidence of unusually aggressive pricing in servers, particularly in January.  Did you see that and overall looking at the Enterprise Hardware segment are you having to walk away from some of the big deals to put up this very strong profitability you've been putting in?
Mark Hurd: I get a kick out of when Bill says, "unusually aggressive".  I can't remember when it wasn't unusually aggressive.  I mean, it is just a competitive marketplace.  I can't say I saw anything in January or December or any time during the quarter that I would describe as different from what we've normally seen.  If I had a data point, if I had enough data to tell you that, I would.  I just haven't seen it.  I do think the pricing in the marketplace is aggressive, and I would expect it to continue to be aggressive and that speaks to the fact that we've got to make sure We are doing our job in terms of cost and so forth, but nothing that I can point to.
Brian Humphries: Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
Shannon Cross: Good afternoon.  Just a question in terms of the commodity environment, what are you seeing in terms of component pricing, anything specific we should be watching for?
Mark Hurd: Yes, I will give you a little color.  The ramp prices were up a bit in Q 1.  We expect some stabilization through Q2 and hopefully that will balance out as we look at the back half of the year.  Processors, supply is now finally normalized, so I know we had some issues as we went going into Q4 we were concerned about, but supply has normalized .  That has helped.  Prices on panels have dropped a bit post holiday.  We expect them to be stable to declining.  Hard drives supplies is meeting demand, so pricing declines have been a little less than what we've normally seen.  That would be my quick top of trees view, Shannon.
Shannon Cross: Okay, great.  Thank you.
Brian Humphries: Next question, please, operator.
Operator: Your next question is from Brian Alexander with Raymond James.
Brian Alexander: Thanks.  Mark, you mentioned a couple times on the call contra revenue items can you give us a sense what you are referring to there and any way you can break out how much the reduction of that is having an impact on top line growth?
Mark Hurd: It is not just reduction.  It really is how we deploy it because what it is basically is our alignment of discounts, market development funds, promotion dollars, to, in most cases, to the channel and the partners, and the real crux of it is how you align those channel compensation dollars to the performance of the channels.  For example, when you go to the channel and say I am going to give you as my partner $1 to create some demand or a revenue goal, the question is maybe I should say instead of giving you $1 for getting this revenue goal, I am going to give you $0.25 for the revenue goal and $0.25 for the mix that you deliver within the revenue, 25% for this and 25% for that and incent a different kind of behavior from you and that's what I mean by the alignment of the contra revenue.  We have cases where we have partners that do that.  We wish they wouldn't, but in the end of the day, that's not the bulk of it in terms of saving dollars.  Bulk is really how we deploy it, how we align it so we expect the appropriate behavior in the marketplace and the numbers are significant for us in terms of dollars and being able to align that to partners and I think I said before, but I will say it one more time.  We actually have partners that take our brand which is one of the 12, 13 leading brands in the world, lead with our brand and hollow out our product and put in other products and components.  That's not nearly as interesting to us as somebody that really puts a full Hewlett-Packard solution together provided that fits for the customer.  We want to incent more of the latter as opposed to the former and that's what we mean by the realignment of contra within the business.  I hope that helps.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Brian.  Next question, please.
Operator: Your next question is from Steven Fortuna with Prudential Equity Group.
Brian Humphries: Steve, are you there?
Operator: Mr. Fortuna your line is open.  Please proceed.
Steve Fortuna: Yes, okay.  Can you hear me now.
Brian Humphries: Yes.
Steve Fortuna: Quick question where do you guys stand relative to your efforts to reduce number of channel partners in Europe?
Mark Hurd: Boy, Steve, I can't give you a count.  I can tell you that we've been on our new program really since the end of October which really focuses more on the alignment of contra and a partner what we call a partner plus program which really doesn't have a specific objective, Steve, to reduce partners, but to really align the behavior into this new model that I just described, so we don't really keep a metric around reducing the partners, more around how we are incenting partners.  So sorry I can't give you more data there.
Brian Humphries: Next question, please, operator.
Operator: Your next question is from Joel Wagonfeld with First Albany.
Joel Wagonfeld: Thanks.  Follow up to the last two questions.  Wondering when we should expect to see real tangible changes in your vice channel strategy in the U.S. in terms of your relationships with your partners and whether you can quantify for that that for us either in dollars or volume or productivity metrics the types of benefits your expecting and over what time frame? And then related to that if you had any that's on demand based on Ingram's calls is sounds like Banoba is likely to expand beyond the ThinkPad real soon, and only a matter of time for Acorp as well? Any thoughts now you might deal with that? Thanks.
Mark Hurd: In terms of the dollars and metrics, Joel, I am not going to go there.  Our work in the U.S. is ongoing.  You should, we started this year with work in the U.S., and you should expect us to continue that work, and I believe overall it is going well.  Like any time you change things, though, you have different issues that you have to deal with.  I won't go into metrics around it.  It really is again back to one of the earlier questions about within our margin mix, getting our alignment with our partners and getting our incentives lined up is a big piece of our opportunity to improve the Company.
Brian Humphries: We'll take two more questions, please, operator.
Operator: Your next question comes from Andrew Neff with Bear, Stearns.
Andrew Neff: Sure.  Two things if I could.  You were quoted on the tape saying something about considering some acquisitions in storage.  I wonder if you can clarify what you mean there and secondly if you talk about, you've done a number of hires over the course of the past year.  How are you meshing them into the HP culture and what are they bringing to the HP that you couldn't get internally?
Mark Hurd: Yes, thanks, Andy.  First I think in terms of storage I don't want to predict any future acquisitions.  What I really was trying to do was describe what we've done, and I think in areas like storage and servers and management software, these are really key areas for us, Andy in terms of filling out our technology capability, and most importantly for us in the intellectual property piece of that area, so that's what we've been doing, and why it is important to us to build out our IP capability.  At the same time we want to be dealing with companies that we can integrate into HP appropriately and operationally deal with as we do it.  Those are really the principles.  We've got great technology, things that add to our stack, bring us more intellectual property and things we can operationally integrate as we do it and I think that's what you've seen us do. In terms of the management, it has been important for us to bring capability into the Company and when I look at management teams, I typically try to map first the skills we need long run to execute the strategy of the Company, and then you want to do an inventory what you what you currently have and from there you do a gap analysis.  You look at what you can develop from what you got and what you have to supplement.  We've done the supplemental; work that we need to do and we'll never be the point we don't have to hire outside, but when we mesh as a group We are meshing around our plan, and frankly We are I think We are doing a good job of bringing the team together as a united team behind the achievement of our strategy and the financial plans underneath it.
Brian Humphries: Thank you very much, Andy.
Operator: Your last question comes from Cindy Shaw with Moors and Cabot Capital Markets, Inc.
Cindy Shaw: Thanks very much.  I am hearing from the channel that their win rate versus Dell is the best it has been in years and it has improved a great deal.  I wonder if you can comment on how much you think Hewlett-Packard might be benefiting from that.
Mark Hurd: I think, Cindy, for us it is really important to support these folks.  I think that our channel partners are real core ones, are putting out a lot of effort and We are trying to put renewed energy behind them and I am pleased to hear about their success, so We are going to put more energy behind these core partners and we hope that in the end that that provides opportunity for them as well as us.  Certainly, it is important for us in Consumer as it relates to Retail which we think is a key advantage for us to be able to leverage their capability, skill, and their reach.  At the same time as an emerging markets we get a real opportunity to get after the commercial marketplace through those partners and we really want to leverage them in that respect as well.
Cindy Shaw: Can you comment if you think that helped the revenue growth in the quarter here?
Mark Hurd: You know, I probably would tell you that I think that as in terms of helping our revenue growth I think it helps our overall performance.  The fact that we can leverage the hybrid model gives us reach in a position that we otherwise, I don't know how we get, Cindy.  Because they get us to a series of buyers we can't get to directly.  We think there is a real benefit to being able to serve some segments directly and some segments through partners because the reach and the extension they have in some of these emerging markets and some of these channels we just can't replicate with our direct resource.  We think it is a key strategic advantage.
Brian Humphries: Thanks, Cindy.
Mark Hurd: Okay.  Let me stop there and before wrapping up, I did want to summarize today's call by saying that overall I am pleased with our execution in the first quarter.  We delivered solid revenue growth.  We did grow margins.  We reduced our expenses and we generated solid cash flow from operations.  We extended our imaging software and storage offerings with key acquisitions.  We did executed against our restructuring program freeing up capital and resources for targeted investments and growth, and we further strengthened our management team with key hires.  We know we have more work to do.  We are encouraged by our progress to date as evidenced by our second consecutive quarter of raising EPS estimates.  While I am confident in our ability to meet these targets we have a lot of work ahead.  I will leave my comments at that and I want to thank you again for joining us on today's call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you for your participation in today's conference.  This does conclude the presentation, and you may now disconnect.  Have a good day.

===== 2005 Q4  (2005-11-28 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hewlett-Packard Q4 FY '05 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is Rachel, and I'll be you coordinator today.  Operator Instructions As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Brian Humphries, VP of Investor Relations.
Brian Humphries: Thank you, Rachel, and good afternoon, everyone.  I'd like to welcome you to our fourth quarter earnings conference call.  Joining me today is our CEO and President, Mark Hurd; and CFO, Bob Wayman. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that this call is being Webcast live.  The Webcast and the fourth quarter earnings slide presentation, including GAAP reconciliation tables, can be accessed on HP Investor Relations page under Company Information at www.hp.com.  A replay will also be available shortly after the conclusion of the call for approximately one year. Next, it is my duty to inform you that the primary purpose of this call is to provide you with information regarding the fourth quarter.  However, some of our comments and responses to your questions may include forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual future results may vary materially. I encourage you to read the risk factors described in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31st, 2005, as well as subsequent SEC filings after our FY '04 Form 10-K for an understanding of the factors that may affect the Company's businesses and results. I'd also like to point out that earnings, gross margins, operating expenses, and similar items discussed at the Company level are generally expressed on a non-GAAP basis and, therefore, have been adjusted to exclude certain acquisition-related charges, in-process R&D charges, amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles, restructuring charges, and net investment losses.  A presentation of GAAP financial information for the present quarter and a reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to GAAP are included in the financial statements accompanying today's earnings release, which is also available on the HP Investor Relations page under hp.com. Finally, we have a lot of people on today's call, and with a view to allowing time for multiple questions from multiple firms, please refrain from asking multi-part questions and please save clarifications for call-back after the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Hurd.
Mark Hurd: Thanks, Brian.  Well, good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.  I'm pleased with our fourth quarter results.  We delivered solid operational results, saw margin expansion in some of our key businesses, had good cost discipline, generated strong cash flow, and continued to make progress on key initiatives.  The employees of HP have been working hard, and our efforts are paying off.  Let me give you some highlights of the quarter. First, net revenue growth of 7%, year-over-year, or 6% in local currency.  Non-GAAP EPS growth of 24% year-over-year.  Continued operating margin expansion in key businesses, with Personal Systems' operating margins of 2.8%, Enterprise Storage and Servers' margins of 9.1%, and Software margins of 8.7%.  Our third consecutive quarter of solid printer hardware unit growth in Imaging and Printing, one of the leading indicators of future supplies growth. Cash flow from operations of 1.9 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to 8 billion, and share repurchases of 1.4 billion, bringing the year-to-date total to 3.5 billion.  Our performance in the fourth quarter, coupled with a solid third quarter, triggered significant employee bonuses for the second half of fiscal 2005.  And the fourth quarter impact of this is reflected in the segment results. Now turning quickly to the business segments.  During the fourth quarter, Imaging and Printing revenue grew 4% year-over-year, to 6.8 billion, with Consumer Hardware revenue down 4% and Commercial Hardware revenue and Supplies revenue up 4% and 7%, respectively.  Segment operating profit was 896 million, or 13.2% of revenue. During the quarter, overall printer hardware unit growth was 8%, with consumer printer hardware unit shipments up 6% and commercial printer hardware unit shipments up 16%.  Within these categories, we saw strong unit shipment growth in key initiatives, with All-In-One unit shipments up 25% year-over-year, color laser unit shipments up 41% year-over-year, and enterprise multi-function printer shipments up 83%. We are focused on driving unit growth of high-ink consumption units, and we're confident that this will drive solid supplies growth.  We've also seen strong acceptance of products based on our recently introduced, Scaleable Print Technology, a breakthrough in the architecture and manufacturing of the ink jet printhead.  This allows us to deliver record print speeds in the home and office, and can be scaled to a broad set of high-volume printing applications, making it one of our most significant announcements in recent years. We're also focused on success in the high end, with our digital press wide-format graphics initiatives.  On November 1st, we closed our acquisition of Scitex, expanding our leadership in large-format printing into the industrial super-wide category.  And at PRINT 05, we announced major advances in the digital transformation of the graphics art industry, further consolidating our leadership position.  This is a significant opportunity for HP, and we're aligning significant resources behind the commercial print opportunity. Moving now to Personal Systems, we continued to show a balanced approach to revenue growth and operating margin improvements.  Revenue grew 9% year-over-year, to 7.1 billion, with particular strength in notebooks, where revenue increased 23%.  Our consumer business had another excellent quarter, with revenue growth of 14% year-over-year and strong operating margins.  Consumer notebook shipments increased 48% over the prior year period, demonstrating HP's competitive strength and strong retail presence, as well as the shift to mobility.  Revenue in commercial clients increased 8% year-over-year, with notebooks posting strong growth and profitability improvements.  Our workstation business continues to post solid results, delivering share gains, strong year-over-year revenue growth, and excellent profitability. Segment operating profit was 200 million, or 2.8% of revenue, representing the fifth consecutive quarter of operating margin improvement in Personal Systems.  The team has done an excellent job turning around the profitability of the PC business, and operating margins have now increased for each of the last four quarters, with full year fiscal '05 margins at 2.5% of revenue. Enterprise Storage and Servers had a strong quarter, with revenue up 10% year-over-year, to 4.5 billion and operating profit of 405 million, or 9.1% of revenue.  Over the past 12 months, the Enterprise Storage and Server team is focused on various operational levers to improve the momentum and profitability of the business.  This quarter's results reflect their efforts in turning around the business and demonstrating the financial leverage of the model. Within ESS, revenue in industry-standard servers increased 12% year-over-year, reflecting continued, solid execution on a number of fronts, including discount controls, option attach rates, and unit mix.  We continue to see strength in server blades, where revenue increased 65% over the prior-year period.  Revenue in business critical systems declined 1% year-over-year.  We continue to see solid momentum in Integrity servers, with revenue up 70% year-over-year.  And this was offset by weakness in PA-RISC and Alpha. Storage revenue increased 17% year-over-year, reflecting improved execution and solid growth in every product category and every region.  We saw ongoing strength in the mid-range, with EVA revenue up 44% year-over-year.  We also had solid growth at the high end, where XP revenues increased 32% over the prior-year period.  We will continue to work hard on key initiatives, such as sales specialists hiring and our alignment with enterprise VARs to drive sustainable momentum in Storage. Revenue in HP Services grew 6% year-over-year, to 3.9 billion, within HPS, Technology Services grew 4%, Managed Services grew 9%, and Consulting and Integration revenue grew 11%.  We're working on driving greater efficiency and leveraging the Services organization, be it delivery model improvements and investments in lower-cost locations.  We are also working to leverage the R&D investments in OpenView to reduce the cost structure of Services, and to optimize our R&D road map. Segment operating profit was 322 million, or 8.3% of revenue.  As in the third quarter, HP Services' margins were pressured by the Company bonus accrual, given the headcount intensity of the business.  If you exclude the fourth quarter bonus accrual, operating margins in Managed Services and Consulting and Integration were at their best levels in two and three years, respectively.  And operating margins in Technology Services were at their highest levels in fiscal year '05.  However, we need to deliver solid margins, while absorbing the Company bonus payments, and we’ll continue to work hard on the operations of the business to drive to this goal. Turning to Software, revenue grew 11%, to 311 million, with growth in OpenView and OpenCall of 16% and 3%, respectively.  Software delivered its first ever operating profit, with segment operating profit of 27 million, or 8.7% of revenue.  We are pleased to be in the black, and will continue to work on revenue growth and productivity initiatives, as well as cost discipline. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our Software offerings with the pending acquisition of Peregrine.  The acquisition will add key asset and service management components to the HP OpenView portfolio, a distributed management software suite for business operations and IT.  Peregrine's capabilities include: asset tracking, expense controls, process automation, service control, service alignment, and enterprise discovery, IT executive dashboard products, as well as outsourcing business continuity, and consolidation management. I'll leave my segments comments at that for now, and I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Bob Wayman: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone.  Let me begin with a quick review of the performance of our Financial Services business.  Revenue for HPFS during the quarter was 514 million, up 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.  Operating margin was 10.1%, up from 3.8% last year, and down from 11.9% in Q3.  The improvement in margin is largely due to the fact that Q4 '04 results were adversely impacted by the recording of reserves for certain receivables.  During the course of FY '05, the risk profile of the portfolio has steadily improved, and the reserve levels have been adjusted accordingly.  Financing volume decreased 1% year-over-year, and was up 21% sequentially.  Portfolio assets decreased 3% year-over-year, and increased 1% sequentially. Now, onto the key elements of the P&L.  Non-GAAP EPS was $0.51, up from $0.41 a year ago.  GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.14, which included 1.1 billion, or $0.37, in after-tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results.  The majority of the adjustments relate to pre-tax restructuring charges of 1.6 billion, which is a more significant charge than the 1.1 billion that we estimated when we announced our restructuring in July.  The increase over our initial estimates is due to the following: approximately 250 million, primarily associated with higher U.S.  early retirement program costs versus our original estimates, and incremental expense from the acceleration of vesting and extension of exercise periods on stock options; approximately 200 million, primarily arising from differences in the job mix of terminated employees versus original estimates; and we now expect to include approximately 15,300 employees in our announced restructuring program, approximately 800 more than our original estimate. While some of these additional costs will not yield additional savings, we do expect roughly 150 million in incremental annual gross savings beginning in FY '07, above 1.9 billion in gross savings that we estimated in July.  Consistent with our announcement in July, we expect roughly half of these savings to fall to earnings.  Note also, that although we took a significant charge in the fourth quarter, we will not begin to yield savings until employees have left the Company.  Approximately 4,700 employees left the Company in the fourth quarter related to the July announcement.  We still estimate that we will be executing on the plan throughout '06, and savings will increase accordingly. Revenue of 22.9 billion for the quarter was up 7% year-over-year, and up 6% when adjusted for effects in currency.  On a regional basis, revenue was up 5% in the Americas, 8% in EMEA, and 12% in Asia-Pacific.  When adjusted for the effects in currency, revenue is up 4% in the Americas, 8% in EMEA, and 9% in Asia-Pacific.  Gross profit was 5.4 billion for the quarter, or 23.5% of revenue, up from 23.4 a year ago, and 23.2% sequentially. Year-over-year gross margin improvements in ESS, PSG, and to a lesser extent HPFS and Software were partially offset by gross margin declines in IPG and HPS.  Non-GAAP operating expense totaled 3.6 billion for the quarter, or 15.9% of revenue, down from 16.4% a year ago, and 17.5% sequentially.  Adjusting for currency, expenses were up 3% year-over-year, and 1% sequentially.  Given that bonus accrual significantly pressured OpEx relative to the prior year, I am overall pleased with the progress we've made in OpEx, and we'll continue to focus on expense management. Non-GAAP operating profit was 1.7 billion, or 7.6% of revenue, up 245 million year-over-year, and 543 million sequentially.  Non-GAAP other income and expense was income of 135 million, or roughly $0.04 per share, above the $0.02 per share we had estimated coming into the quarter.  The increase reflects more favorable net interest income and currency impacts than our original estimate. Given current interest rates, projected cash and debt levels, and currency dynamics, we estimate OI&E to be about $0.03 per share per quarter for FY '06.  While we may experience some one-time gains or losses from this baseline, these items are difficult to predict, and we will just call them out if and/or when they occur.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.0% for the quarter, in line with our guidance.  I expect a non-GAAP tax rate of about 20% for fiscal 2006. Next to balance sheet.  HP-owned inventory came in at 6.9 billion, down 194 million year-over-year, and up 233 million sequentially.  Inventory days of supply stands at 35 days, down from 39 days last year, and 38 days sequentially.  Inventory was managed well across each of our businesses. Regarding channel inventory, we ended the quarter in excellent shape across the board, with ESS and PSG at roughly 4 weeks and IPG a bit over 5 weeks.  Quarter IPG channel inventory dollars were down year-over-year, while PSG was roughly flat.  PSS dollars were up from unusually low prior year levels. Trade receivables ended the quarter at 9.9 billion, down 323 million, or 3% over the prior year, and up 1.1 billion, or 13% sequentially, in line with normal seasonality.  As a percentage of revenue, trade receivables were 11.4%, down from 12.8% year-over-year, and up from 10.3% sequentially.  DSO now stands at 39 days, down from 43 days last year, and up sequentially from 38 days. Next, property plant and equipment was down $198 million year-over-year, and up 21 million sequentially, to 6.5 billion.  Gross CapEx was 522 million, down 29% year-over-year, and up 57% sequentially.  On a net basis, CapEx was 446 million, down 30% year-over-year, and up 114% sequentially, primarily reflecting a lease reclassification that I mentioned last quarter.  Financing assets accounted for a significant portion of CapEx during the quarter. Net PP&E as a percent of revenue now stands at 7.4%, down from 8.3% year-over-year, and 7.5% sequentially.  Regarding accounts payable, days payable closed the quarter at 52 days, up from 51 days both sequentially and year-over-year. Next some comments on cash.  Cash flow from operations was 1.9 billion for the quarter, despite paying approximately 900 million in funding to the pension plans and 300 million in tax payments related to repatriation.  For the full year, we generated 8 billion of cash from operations, up 58% up year-over-year.  Free cash flow, that is, operating cash flow, less net CapEx, was 6.6 billion, up 93% over last year.  Both operating cash flow and free cash flow are the highest in the Company's history.  For Q1 cash flow planning purposes do keep in mind that we expect significant cash outlays associated with our restructuring actions and Company bonus payment. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 billion in stock, and paid 229 million in our normal dividend.  For the full year '05, we repurchased 3.5 million in stock and paid over 900 million in dividends.  We closed the quarter with total gross cash of 13.9 billion, down from 14.6 billion sequentially, and up from 13.0 billion year-over-year.  Our weighted average shares outstanding remained flat from Q3 to Q4, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter. Going forward, I expect weighted average shares outstanding to remain about flat with our Q4 exit level of 2,915 billion.  This expectation takes into account our continuing share repurchase activities and the current year appreciation in the stock price.  There will, of course, be some variation based on our level of share repurchases and on the subsequent share price and its impact on option exercise patterns and common stock equivalents. Now, a few full year P&L highlights.  For the full year, revenue was 86.7 billion, up 8% year-over-year, or 6% when adjusted for the effects of currency.  On a full-year basis, non-GAAP EPS was $1.62, up 22%, from 1.33 last year.  GAAP EPS for the year was $0.82, which included 2.3 billion, or $0.80 in after-tax adjustments that were not included in our non-GAAP results. Now for a few comments on our outlook for Q1 and the full year fiscal '06.  On a constant currency basis, revenue typically declines by approximately 2 to 3% from Q4 into Q1, in line with normal business seasonality.  However, given the significant currency movements over the last few months, we are faced with an additional sequential headwind of approximately 1% in Q1, if exchange rates stay roughly where they are today.  With this in mind, we expect revenue of 22.3 to 22.6 billion in Q1 '06. The full year impact of currency fluctuations is more difficult to predict.  However, given the euro traded in the 1.25 to 1.35 range for the majority of FY '05, we expect an adverse full year currency impact of approximately 2 to 3% for FY '06, with our current modeling suggesting that Q2 '06 growth may be the most adversely affected.  When looking forward to the full year and taking these currency effects into account, we estimate FY '06 revenue growth of roughly 3 to 5%, suggesting FY '06 revenue of approximately $89.5 to $91.0 billion.  On a constant-currency basis, this would reflect similar growth to the 6% constant-currency growth we achieved in FY '05. Before addressing EPS guidance, a few comments on stock compensation.  Effective Q1 '06, we are adopting FAS123R, which requires us to include expenses related to stock compensation based on their fair values.  We are providing non-GAAP EPS estimates with and without option expenses for comparability purposes.  However, we will include stock compensation in our reported non-GAAP results and ask that all analysts include stock compensation expense in their officially submitted estimates. We are adopting FAS123R prospectively, and as such, we will not be restating prior period financial results.  To assist you in analyzing trends in our stock compensation, we have provided two slides in our earnings presentation which include stock compensation functionalized between cost of goods sold, and operating expenses for the last eight quarters.  Also, for FY '06 we currently intend to hold FAS123R expenses at the corporate level and not allocate them to our operating segments. We expect Q1 '06 non-GAAP EPS of $0.46 to $0.48, excluding stock compensation, or $0.42 to $0.44, including approximately $0.03 or $0.04 from stock-based compensation.  For FY '06, we expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.88 to $1.95, excluding stock compensation, or $1.75 to $1.82, including approximately $0.13 from stock-based compensation. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Operator, to begin the Q&A.
