===== 2025 Q1  (2025-02-25 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joel and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 25th, 2025 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. I'd now like to hand the call over to Harry Blount, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Blount.
Harry Blount: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2025. My name is Harry Blount. I have long admired Keysight as a market leader in accelerating innovation and I am delighted to join Keysight as Head of Inbestor Relations. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A section, we will be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Susquehanna Financial Group and Morgan Stanley. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight delivered strong first quarter results, revenue of $1.3 billion, and earnings per share of $1.82, both exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Core revenues grew for the first time in six quarters, reflecting strength in the Communication Solutions Group and stabilization in our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. Second, orders grew year-over-year for a second consecutive quarter, up 4% to $1.3 billion. We're seeing incrementally positive signals in our sales funnel and customer engagements. Our view of 2025 remains unchanged. We continue to expect gradual recovery even as we monitor the policy changes contemplated by the new administration in the United States. Third, we're well-positioned for the future. The world's most technologically advanced companies trust us to deliver market-leading products and solutions at the physical, protocol, and application layers. The underlying technological trends of more memory, faster processing, greater bandwidths and, with lower power remain intact. We are engaging with our customers earlier and more broadly, which gives us confidence in our ability to create value for our stakeholders. Now let's begin with an overview of Keysight's first quarter business performance. Communications Solutions Group revenue grew 5%, reflecting continued momentum in wireline, stability in wireless, and growth in aerospace, defense, and government. Orders grew for the third consecutive quarter, driven by growth in both wireline and wireless. In wireline, demand remains strong for our physical layer and AI workload emulation solutions, and we saw record orders again this quarter. Keysight is enabling the expansion of the AI data center network and the design of electrical and optical technologies for higher speeds and bandwidth. We continue to see strong engagement from a broad ecosystem, chipset designers, network equipment manufacturers, and hyperscaler customers. At DesignCon, Keysight demonstrated an industry-leading 400 gig per lane test solution enabling 3.2 terabit speeds along with industry-leading low-power DDR6 memory compliance tests. We believe AI will be a long-term secular tailwind for the design of next-generation technologies in the network, data center, and communications ecosystem. Our wireless business performed in line with expectations and consistent with the stability of the past two quarters with ongoing activity related to standards progression in 5G advanced non-terrestrial networks and research in early 6G. We saw relative strength in network infrastructure with ongoing innovation in radio access networks and early 6G, while demand remains muted in the smartphone supply chain. In Q1, we launched our flagship PNA-X pro network analyzer to enable the design of advanced components and modules for early 6G research, aerospace defense, and non-interestrial networks. This solution delivers high-performance capabilities and unmatched measurement speeds, while dramatically improving the efficiency of our customers' design workflows. At the upcoming Mobile World Congress, we will be demonstrating PNA-X pro along with other solutions addressing AI, 6G, open radio access networks, and satellite connectivity, many of which will be highlighted in collaboration with industry-leading customers. Turning to aerospace, defense, and government, revenues grew to a first-quarter record with strength in both the US and Asia. The funnel of opportunities remain strong in EMSO, secure communications, space and satellite, while orders were down in the quarter due to ongoing continuing resolutions. Keysight continues to develop differentiated RF and microwave capabilities for security applications such as radar, spectrum operations, and signal monitoring. This quarter, Keysight had a notable win with a European prime for advanced threat simulation solutions. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down 1% and orders were stable, reflecting mixed demand across end-markets. In semiconductor, fab capacity investment and AI-driven demand for advanced node technologies, high-bandwidth memory, and silicon photonics continued to drive strong customer engagement. New fab projects are ramping, helping drive a third consecutive quarter of strong order growth for our parametric wafer test solutions. In automotive, market conditions remain challenged, reflecting muted activity in manufacturing and EV battery development. Despite the near-term headwinds, customer engagement and innovation remain high in R&D for software-defined applications and autonomous driving. Next-generation autos will require optical technologies for high-bandwidth data transfer and processing within the vehicle. This quarter, Keysight partnered with fabulous semiconductor company to deliver a new multi-gigabit optical Ethernet test solution. In General Electronics, orders grew for the second consecutive quarter. Customer spending in our industrial end-markets was driven by high-speed PCB and connectivity applications and inventory normalization in the distribution channel. We also saw strong growth in advanced research, particularly in Europe and Asia. We have made strategic progress in growing software and services, which accounted for approximately 40% of Keysight revenue, while recurring revenue was approximately 31% of total revenue. We are seeing growing customer engagement in our Design Engineering Software solutions. And in ESI, we saw new demand in aerospace, defense, as well as industrial customers. In closing, we're pleased that we've returned the company to growth, our robust innovation pipeline, strategic customer relations, and strong operating and capital discipline position us well to create value for all our stakeholders. I'd like to sincerely thank our employees once again for all their outstanding contributions, commitment, and track record of execution. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. First-quarter revenue of $1,298 million was above the high-end of our guidance range and up 3% on a reported and core basis, while orders of $1,263 million were up 4% on a reported and core basis. Backlog finished the quarter at $2.3 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 65.8%. Operating expenses of $500 million were up 2% year-over-year and Q1 operating margin was 27%. Turning to earnings. We achieved $317 million of net income and delivered earnings per share of $1.82. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 174 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communication Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $883 million, up 5% year-over-year on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $572 million and aerospace, defense, and government revenue of $311 million, each increased 5%. Altogether, CSG delivered 68% gross margin and 27% operating margin. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $415 million, down 1% or flat on a core basis. EISG reported 61% gross margin and 27% operating margin, largely due to a higher mix of software. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $378 million and free cash flow of $346 million. We repurchased 450,000 shares this quarter at an average price of approximately $167 for a total consideration of $75 million. Now turning to our outlook. We expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,270 million to $1,290 million and Q2 earnings per share in the range of $1.61 to $1.67 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. As a reminder, Keysight's historical first to second quarter revenue seasonality will be muted by the cadence of the ESI business. Looking to the second half, the macro-environment is expected to continue to be mixed, including uncertainty stemming from potential US policy actions. Despite this, our base-case scenario for gradual recovery in FY 2025 remains unchanged with assumptions for revenue growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target and earnings growth consistent with our 10% target. In closing, we are executing well and capitalizing on the recovery as it evolves across our end markets. Our broad and diverse customer base, expanding solutions portfolio, deep customer engagements, and robust innovation pipeline provide a solid foundation for the year ahead. With that, I will turn it back to Harry for the Q&A.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instructions for Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Priyanka Thapa: Hi, Priyanka Thapa on for Samik Chatterjee. So my question is...
Satish Dhanasekaran: Hi, Priyanka.
Priyanka Thapa: What are the upsides from the Commercial Communications -- hi, yes. So my question is on the Commercial Communications segment. And regarding upsides to that segment, could you provide what you anticipate that kind of breakdown between the contribution from wireline versus wireless will be since you had this quarter stability in what -- wireless and you had a lot of strong growth in wireline due to the AI factors.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think you characterized it very well. We saw stability in wireless and some uptick in our infrastructure portion of the wireless business as operator CapEx outlook is getting better. So the smartphone ecosystem continues to be muted in its recovery. So that's the stability picture in wireless. But really the highlight was the strong growth in orders and demand that we saw for our wireline offerings driven by AI.
Priyanka Thapa: And what do you anticipate that trend to be in the future if anything? Do you think it's still going to be wireline stable or do you expect an uptick if the smartphone ecosystem improves?
Satish Dhanasekaran: It's -- at least in our short term, we think the wireless continues to be stable. That's sort of our base case thinking. There could be some upside as spending in infrastructure ramps in that area. But we feel very strongly that the innovation drivers in AI continue to be robust along with the investment outlook that our customers have shared with us today.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: [Technical Difficulty] Kind of noted continuing resolutions kind of as a reason for order weakness on aerospace and defense, but just kind of how you're seeing kind of the current budget environment around federal? And then maybe as a second question, is there any way to kind of contextualize the order strength you saw in kind of wireline specifically that would kind of allow us to kind of contextualize some of the strength you're talking about on AI? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I will, Meta. So let me start with the aerospace defense and then we get to the other piece. I think, look, it's a business I've said before, really difficult to call on every quarterly basis, but you take a long-term view, it's probably one of our more stable businesses to call because the defense budgets keep going up with GDP and an increasing portion of that is towards technology modernization or what we call defense modernization. So no change to that long-term trend. If I look at the pipeline of opportunities where we have engaged in, continue to remain strong. I point you to some data points, right? The backlog of prime contractors is at a record level and the demand for solutions from our customers remains strong. I think we're just balancing typical continuing resolution issues in terms of timing of those deals combined with administration change. So any minor near-term perturbation typically tends to get worked out in a few quarters. That's what we're seeing. But again, we had a strong revenue growth this quarter from our aerospace and defense business as we delivered some of the solutions that we have booked last year as well. With regard to AI, I would say that the supply-chain environment for AI remains constrained as capital flows through and we're seeing a strong uptick in manufacturing for these sorts of high-end capabilities and we're well-positioned and we're capitalizing on those at this point. But equally exciting for us is the longer-term opportunity coming in multiple dimensions for Keysight's products and solutions. And I would say all the way from the accelerated adoption of technology standards such as PCIe Gen 7, you look at LPDDR6, you look at the 400 gig to 800 gig to -- increased activity in R&D around the terabit speeds, all of that really creates a very robust pipeline of opportunities that really matches the areas that we had invested in last year and we're able to capitalize on that. And we feel good about the growing number of collaborations we have in this space with customers because the challenges that they're facing are quite complex as they start to put some of this CapEx to work and start implementing some of these high-speed AI clusters, I think we're making a meaningful contribution, then that's only going to grow with time.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Hi, Mehdi.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sorry. I had a hard time unmuting. Apologies there. A couple of follow-ups from me. One near-term, one short -- longer-term. Let me start with the longer term. And Neil and Satish, when you're looking at your R&D activity looking over the next -- commercialization over the next several years, how should we think about the pros and cons of 5G plus or 6G versus satellite communication? Could we at some point in the latter part of this decade, reach a point where there would be more of a commercialization of the satellite comm and would that be some sort of an I don't want to say substitution, but complementing the evolution of 5G? And I have a follow-up.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, I think that's a fair characterization, Mehdi, that satellite communications, especially non-terrestrial networks and that ecosystem growing in its contribution both for security and for commercial applications, it's an incremental opportunity for us if that's the way you want to think about it for our wireless business in the medium-term. And then 6G clearly is the other major technology driver that we're seeing increased R&D investments at this point, more R than D, but as things slow, eventually leads to standardization, leads to deploy -- development and deployment also to come.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. But what's the net impact on Keysight? Would that actually be incremental for Keysight, zeros -- or is no neutral -- net neutral for Keysight opportunities?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, whenever you're staring at a new generation of technology, I think it's safe to say that one doesn't see greatest resolution way ahead of time. But I can tell you just from looking back at history of every business, you go back to 3G, 4G, and 5G, and there is no doubt that the SAM, if you think of it over a longer period of time, has grown just because of growing complexity. And not to mention, we're still quite early in our innings in terms of expanding our capabilities and really deploying the fullest extent of capabilities of the company. That's been our focus. And I think you should take away that our ability to invest in the downturn last year is going to mean that we did not lose any steam. In fact, we continue to grow stronger in terms of our ability to say yes to our customers, participate in early pilots. So I feel good about our position. Hard to really say exactly how big the SAM will be, but if history is any gauge, the R&D opportunity will definitely be bigger and we're prepared to capitalize on that.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Nice quarter.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Can you give a little more color? You talked about a positive sales funnel and encouraging customer engagements. Just curious if that's an indicator that we might be closer to a mixed demand environment becoming a solid demand environment.
Mark Wallace: Yes, Adam. What I can say is that it's incrementally improving since the last time we spoke three months ago, and it's in-line with what we've been speaking about, which is the steady gradual improvement and recovery here in 2025. And we've spoken about our funnel, which goes out about six months and that six-month funnel is improving in multiple ways. The first is new funnel intake, which is the most important to me, that's new business coming in through the pipeline and we see that improving and it's solid as markets do begin to recover and increasing demand is occurring. The second is velocity. That means how fast customers are making decisions and that is improving and we look at that in terms of how much business is created and closed in a particular quarter. And then obviously, the third part, which is the end goal is having a big funnel and the funnel is growing and our short-term funnel, meaning looking out three months is in support of our Q2 guide. So I think the summary is, we have better visibility than we did three months ago. Our signals are generally moving more positive incrementally and it supports our thesis of a gradual recovery during the year.
Adam Thalhimer: All right. Good color, Mark. And then just also can you comment on how EV sales are trending? What the expectations are there?
Mark Wallace: How -- which part?
Satish Dhanasekaran: How easy are sales?
Mark Wallace: How easy are sales?
Adam Thalhimer: EV.
Mark Wallace: Oh EV, electric. Yes. So automotive in general is -- yes, so the EV sales, which in our focus is really around R&D for battery development has remained constrained. We see activity in e-mobility overall. So as the hardware and software architectures in the automobiles begin to disaggregate in terms of software-defined vehicles and communication speeds increase, we are seeing an uptick in that focus and investment from our customers. But right now, as far as what we're seeing in the last quarter and what our funnel tells us is that EV and battery test remains soft.
Neil Dougherty: Auto manufacturing as well remains soft.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. Can we get an update on sort of the performance of the ESI Group sort of following on that -- question is, is the software aspect also facing budget constraints and so forth? And how are you progressing on sort of your margin targets for that acquisition?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I would say the acquisition remains on-track from a target perspective and kind of a realization of synergy perspective, as you know, it's a high recurring revenue business and I think we saw renewal rates in the quarter were consistent with expectations. I do think the relative softness in the auto markets that Mark just talked about did unfavorably impact our upsell to those auto customers within the quarter, but that was then offset as we said in our prepared remarks as we started to get traction with aerospace, defense and industrial customers, kind of newer markets for the ESI product portfolio.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then you have two pending acquisitions coming out of the Ansys and Synopsys deal, right? You have the Optical Solutions Group from Synopsys. And then on the other side of the house, you have a PowerArtist software from Ansys. Are these deals contingent on Ansys going through? And how meaningful are these two on a combined basis just in terms of revenue earnings or some way of quantifying what's in the pipe?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. The two transactions are contingent on the closure of the Synopsys, Ansys transaction and to this point, we have not sized those two transactions, but they were excited to add them to our design engineering software portfolio. We have business in both power management as well as optical, and so they're complementary to the physical air tools that we currently have inside our portfolio.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Mark, let me give you my best and wish you well in your upcoming retirement. And Harry, congratulations on the new role with Keysight.
Mark Wallace: Well, thank you, Mark. Appreciate it.
Mark Delaney: And a couple on the financials, if I could, maybe on operating expenses. I know the company spoke on the last earnings call that as revenue comes back, you'd expect some incremental investments in the business as well as some of the variable cost structure that you have. When I look at OpEx in the quarter, it was only up, I think, about 1% year-on-year. And I think I was looking for a bit more and as I was thinking about fiscal 2025, I've been looking for mid single-digit OpEx growth this year based on some of your comments on incrementals from the last call. Maybe you can help us understand a bit more what you're doing from an OpEx perspective. Should we still expect some investments over the course of the year? And if so, how much?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I show total OpEx up about 2% on a year-over-year basis Q1 versus Q1. I think what you see, one of the reasons maybe that was a little bit more muted than you expected. Obviously, we were in a bit of a cost reduction mode last year. All of those were not realized in Q1. And so, we kind of made progress through the year on reductions. And then as we rolled here into Q2, not only we have seen our variable pay expense ratchet up, we'd be the salary administration as we always do in the first quarter of the year, midway through the quarter. So as you think about what's implied in our Q2 guide, we do expect a sequential increase in OpEx as you move from Q1 to Q2. We have a full quarter of those salary increases. Obviously, with the Christmas holidays as well as the Chinese New Year holidays falling as Q1, what significantly lower PTO usage in the quarter, which also puts upper pressure on OpEx. I think as you think about investments and Satish already alluded to this, our ability to continue to keep core programs on-track during the downturn and now potentially as the business returns to growth, start to fund some incremental dollars into things like 6G, quantum computing and capturing this AI market opportunity for us is something that we're excited about and there's no shortage of opportunities for us to continue to layer on incremental investment.
Mark Delaney: Thank you, Neil. In about 40% incremental margins, is that the right framework if you guys grow the top line mid single-digits for the year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I would say on average for quarters where we're growing 5% or better, you can think about that 40% incremental.
Mark Delaney: Okay. And then my other question was just around gross margins. I think it was down a little bit year-on-year. Maybe you could speak a bit on what was driving that in terms of factors like price cost and mix? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, it's mostly mix related. If you go back and look at the trend lines, we were still to some extent benefiting from the sale of backlog even into Q1 of last year. And then we saw a pretty significant step function down in the Q2, Q3, Q4 of FY 2024. So this was our last really tough compare from a gross margin standpoint. The gross margin performance that we just put up in Q1 is the highest gross margin performance we've had in the last four quarters was aided a little bit by the incremental ESI revenue. But again relative to the past three quarter some favorable mix, but compared to a year ago, the mix was less favorable.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I think just to add a little bit more color, you look at the businesses, which are a lot more R&D indexed, Mark, and the company in CSG, the gross margins are 68%. In the EISG business, as we've talked about, there's a wide dispersion between the manufacturing and R&D businesses and that's work that Jason's this new role is going to continue to do. But if you look at that portfolio last year, that was at 65%, just the mix was so much more favorable leading to this compare at the company-level. But longer-term, we feel-good about the opportunity to continue to bear on more R&D contributions to our customers and create greater value for them and ability to that value as we roll these solutions out.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. Just two if I could. First on orders, maybe, Neil, if there's any framework in terms of how to think about fiscal 2Q orders sequentially just in light of a gradual recovery in the business, but some moving parts with ESI. And then secondly, on the aerospace defense front, you referenced some softness in orders tied to ongoing continuing resolutions. I'm wondering if -- maybe Satish, if you can help frame any conversations, just any sort of sizing in terms of potential risk from those in terms of just government efficiency and what's been going on in DC with the new administration on your business? Thanks so much.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you. So why don't I go first and I'll deal with the sequential question. If you think about this business historically, we would tend to think about Q1 to Q2 seasonal, this is excluding ESI is kind of up mid-single digits sequentially and then that would be offset then by a pullback in ESI that recognizes close to 50% of their orders in the first quarter and Keysight's first quarter with the remaining 50% to 55% spread relatively evenly over the remainder of the fiscal year. So -- and I think that is a fair way to think about it going forward.
Satish Dhanasekaran: With regard to the aerospace and defense, I would say that many of our customers continue to believe that the programs that are already in their backlog from our prime contractor customers is at record levels and there's unlikely to be a big change to that picture. So those things that are already likely to continue on, and that's a pretty big at a record level as I mentioned. So that's number one. And what you look at the global picture in Europe and Asia and you start to see a scenario which is likely to emerge where given the geopolitical realities, their defense spending as a percentage of GDP is likely to go up. As a matter of fact, if you just watch today, UK confirmed taking up the defense spending just today as well. So I think that's likely to be the trend. And given our technology and capabilities, I think we'll continue to be in a good position to capitalize on those opportunities. With regard to the direct government spending, the RDT&E line item is something that we're watching for and will remain [Technical Difficulty] But it's unlikely that we see a scenario where there is a significant cut to technology advancement with regard to security and defense. But that's our base case thinking. That's sort of what our customers are telling us as well, but no one really knows until these things play out. So we're continuing to monitor that.
Matt Niknam: I'm clear in kind of what you're saying. On EISG, do you -- are -- as we see some recovery in that business, do you think that we can consider our gross margin back into that mid 60% range? And then, Neil, on operating margin, I know that you had outlined 31% to 32%. I think that target all the way back in 2023 at the Analyst Day. If we continue to see kind of a 5% growth profile or growth in that range of 5% to 7%, do you think it's conceivable that we can still see that targeted gross margin of 31% or 32% looking into 2026?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Okay. Why don't I explain address both those questions. So I think as it relates to EISG, it's going to be mix dependent. I do think it's likely that we take a little bit of time, again, excluding ESI to climb back to the operating -- to the gross margin levels that we were putting up in fiscal 2023, which -- prior to the addition of ESI running north of 60%. We'll see it's very mix dependent as Satish alluded to and we've talked about many times, it has a broader dispersion of gross margins within that portfolio. So it really depends on what the nature of this recovery is and which businesses are up relative to others. With regard to your -- remind me your second question real quick. Yes, here it is.
Matt Niknam: I was just...
Neil Dougherty: With regard to operating margin and the 2026 targets, I've said previously that we have not lost sight of that 31% to 32% operating margin targets. That still remains our goal. We are likely going to slip on the FY 2026 achievement of that, particularly if the scenario you lay out plays out, which is 5% growth for multiple years. In that case, you could think about 5% growth, 40% incrementals and do rough math on how long it takes to get back. I think we're optimistic that at some point, we get a little bit more of a bounce-back that allows us to accelerate that momentum. And then certainly, while not contemplated at the time, but the closure of pending acquisitions and ability to realize synergies on these high gross margin businesses may ultimately help us to achieve those objectives.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, the other thing worth highlighting to Neil's point is, while there are gross margin differences fundamentally between the two groups, we have tremendous organizational synergies between -- with the work we do for our customers. And so you will see even this quarter, even with the gross margin differences, the operating profit between the two groups were spot on, so 27%, so.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Satish, I was hoping we could go back to the AI business. If you could just maybe double-click on that a little bit. I think in the past, you've talked -- I know you can't really quantify kind of the scale of that business currently, but I was hoping you could kind of walk us through the top three or four use cases and kind of where you are with customer base and increasing new use cases, just trying to get a sense of what the tail will look like for the AI business? And then the follow-up would be on software and services. It looks like we got to about 40%. It's been a pretty steady climb for recurring revenues, the 30% or 31%. Could you talk a little bit about how we should think about that transition going-forward? Should still be this kind of slow and steady up and to the right or is there something that would accelerate that transition? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, let me take the first one. While there's a lot of puts and takes in the near term and I'll just say you take a future state here and say, look, we have about 11,000 data centers today in the world consuming 55 gigawatts of power. And in the next few years, there is an additional 63 gigawatts projected of data centers that are going to go online. Just let's think about that as a fact. Then you overlay on top of it, this difference between training and inferencing and therefore, all of the edge and inferencing applications that's going to grow. We're already seeing signs of increased processor designs, AI accelerated cards, and then you layer on reasoning and inferencing applications. So the long-term picture here is pretty robust for us and we see that picture. We see our customers moving towards that picture and we're in a great position to be able to intercept that and enable their innovation. And I would say, in the near term, we're participating meaningfully in the compute side of things. The 2-nanometer push that's happening, our semi business had a strong quarter again. And we're also working with customers on silicon photonics, which is a very promising technology to come. This is an investment we made about 18 months ago to work with customers. We noted it on a call and it's proving out to be one of the good bets that we've made that positions us well to participate meaningfully in the compute side of things. If you look at the memory, HBMs, again, DDR6, DDR7, again, areas that we participate today. You look at networking, this move to higher speeds is clearly a factor. And let's not forget, all of those interconnects that are going at a rapid pace from 112 to 224 to 448, I mean, requires a lot of high-precision testing because of the cost of failure of these interconnects is very-high when you put it in an AI cluster. And again, that's an area we're meaningfully participating. On the emulation side, we're -- we've launched this AI data center builder, which is our first platform to emulate high scale AI workloads that allows customers to get a meaningful insight into the time utilization, latency and cost to train AI model. So we're participating up and down the stack. Again, congruent with our strategy, we feel like we're well positioned in the short and medium-term and really see this long-term bigger opportunity that I'm very excited about. And then with regard to the second question, we've always from the starting of the company felt like as a solutions company, we're really focused on this software centric transformation as we call-it, that's core part of our transformation. We identify areas where we can add meaningful contribution to help our customers in a sustainable way. And obviously, we see 40% as a milestone in that journey and we're not done by any means. I think there is this organic capabilities that we'll continue to launch more new product introductions. I look at our hardware introductions to software introductions ratio or software introductions far outpaced our hardware introductions because it does take longer to launch hardware than software. So that's feeling good. And then as Neil alluded to earlier, as we start to bring in new capabilities that some of them we've announced with the Synopsys and Ansys to be played out still, we will start to expand our contributions in the design space, will continue to contribute to higher recurring revenue.
Operator: Thank you. The last question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.
Rob Mason: Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Satish, even in your last response, you mentioned your participation where you're participating in semiconductor. And I think earlier you talked about third consecutive quarter of good parametric test orders. I'm just, I'm curious if you're starting to build some backlog in that business and if that's the case, if you have, what's your visibility on revenue conversion for that?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I mean, so we -- as you noted, multiple quarters of growth here in the parametric test side of this business and continue to have a favorable outlook on that opportunity as we look forward, given some of these new fab opportunities that are coming online. We have built some backlog over the last three quarters, obviously and that will -- but again, reminding you of our primary order acceptance window is this -- is that we're accepting opportunities that are shippable within six months. So the conversion of those orders into revenue is relatively short.
Rob Mason: Understood. And just as a follow-up, just could you touch on your business within China in general, what you saw, how your business trend during the quarter, obviously it's geopolitical volatility probably. I know in the past when things have emerged, obstacles have emerged, you've been able to pivot to new opportunities. I'm just curious if you're finding yourself needing to pivot in the current environment and if so, what are you leaning into?
Satish Dhanasekaran: First and foremost, I would say I was just in China a few months ago. The strength of our customer relationships continues to be strong. With the geopolitical and trade restrictions, we've sort of used to a 1 to 2 headwind post Huawei, which happened a few years ago on a continuous basis. And so that's sort of the pivoting of -- when you call-it pivoting of our focus to customers that we can transact business with. It's also probably not a huge surprise to learn that many of China customers have a go global strategy and that's something that we're through the relationships we have with them, we're supporting their go global efforts, whether it is relocating their manufacturing to Southeast Asia or parts of the North America. So I mean at the end of the day, I think it is a shifting landscape, but there is no doubt that technology innovations are key to all our customers globally and we're well positioned as a company.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and -- sorry. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Harry Blount for any closing comments.
Harry Blount: Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today on the call. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q4  (2024-11-19 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joel and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, November 19th, 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Paulenier Sims, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ms. Sims.
Paulenier Sims: Thank you and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we will be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Wells Fargo and Barclays. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well and delivered fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share above the high-end of our guidance range under market conditions, which remain consistent with our expectations. Orders finished slightly above our expectations and grew 1% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by ongoing strength in AI and strong year-end bookings in our US Aerospace, Defense and Government Business. Second, strong execution and cost discipline drove full-year revenue of $5 billion and earnings per share of $6.27, which were down from record highs of 2023. Results were paced by gradual improvement throughout the year with better performance in the second half as expected. Under challenging market conditions, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model by delivering 26% operating profit and over $900 million in free cash flow. We also returned approximately 50% of free cash flow to shareholders through repurchases. Third, we progressed our software-centric solutions strategy by investing to realize organic growth opportunities through innovation and industry collaborations, while expanding the breadth of our solutions through selective M&A. As we look ahead, the strength of our differentiated portfolio, deep engagement with customers and the accelerating pace of technology innovation gives us confidence in our ability to outperform as markets recover. Now let's begin with an overview of Keysight's fourth quarter business performance. Communications Solutions Group revenue was flat year-over-year and grew 6% sequentially with growth across both Commercial Communications and Aerospace, Defense and Government. CSG orders returned to growth for the full-year, reflecting AI momentum in wireline, stability in wireless and consistent strength in ADG. In wireline markets, demand remains strong due to ongoing expansion in AI data center infrastructure even as telco investments continue to be muted. As the timeline for 800 gig and 1.6 terabit adoption accelerates, the industry is investing in advanced technologies, including silicon photonics, chiplets and high-speed electrical and optical interconnects. Keysight continued to expand its portfolio of solutions across the technology stack to enable customers in both R&D and manufacturing. At the Open Compute Project in San Jose, Keysight showcased our newly introduced AI workload and system emulation solution in collaboration with academia and hyperscalers. Our solution provides high fidelity emulation of AI model training and inferencing workloads to optimize training time and benchmark AI infrastructure performance. At ECOC Conference, Keysight showcased physical and protocol AI solutions with industry leaders to enable 800 gig interoperability with critical optical and electrical interface technologies. In wireless, demand was stable as smartphone industry nears the end of its inventory correction and telco CapEx normalizes from peak levels. Investment continues in Open RAN expansion, ongoing standards progression with emphasis on non-terrestrial networks and early 6G research. This quarter, we announced multiple O-RAN collaborations with industry leaders such as NTT DOCOMO, DISH Networks and Pegatron. We also collaborated with Qualcomm to establish industry's first end-to-end interoperability and data connection in the candidate frequency band for 6G FR3. We're also well poised to drive industry innovation forward with our differentiated full-stack solutions. Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government stronger-than-expected seasonality drove orders to an all-time high. The funnel of opportunities remain strong. The US defense budget is expected to grow low-single digits, while government investment in defense modernization in Europe and Asia is projected to increase. Customer engagements on electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar and advanced communication use cases remains high. Satellite communication investments is expected to continue as more LEOs constellations are launched over the next few years. Keysight is capitalizing on the growing investment in defense modernization around the globe. At the recent European Microwave Conference, we showcased our leading capabilities in phased array, over-the-air compact antenna design and test in collaboration with analog devices. We also highlighted our latest flagship performance network analyzer. It's differentiated and industry-leading capabilities include wide band, high dynamic range, pre-selective receivers for faster S-parameter measurements to enable customers' high-frequency component designs. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down year-over-year as expected, but grew mid-single-digits sequentially. Orders were mixed with year-over-year growth in semi and general electronics, offset by automotive market headwinds. In semiconductor, robust demand drove strong order growth for our parametric wafer test solutions. We saw broad-based foundry investment to expand capacity and address leading-edge applications driven by AI. This included advanced DRAM technologies such as high-bandwidth memory and DDR5 as well as silicon photonics. Enabling further advances in power semiconductor production and efficiency, this quarter Keysight introduced an innovative single pass 3 kilowatt high voltage wafer test solution. In Automotive, the industry is facing challenges and we expect the headwinds to continue in 2025. This quarter, production-related demand was sequentially stable, while we saw incrementally cautious pending due to slowing EV sales and battery oversupply. Even with near-term headwinds, we remain focused on customers' emerging innovation and design needs. Our R&D engagements for software-defined vehicle as well as broader electrical and physical design applications remain high. ESI grew its solution business this year through steady renewals and new customer additions. Over this period, the ESI team also made significant contributions to the use of AI to improve product performance simulations and offering workflow solutions with immersive visualization to validate assembly and servicing. In general electronics, we saw stable manufacturing demand, albeit at lower levels, and a modest sequential improvement in consumer and industrial high-speed connectivity applications. Public and private sector investment in support of advanced research and technology workforce development grew this quarter and digital health application demand was again strong. Turning to Software and Services, revenues grew 8% this quarter and accounted for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from Software and Services also grew 16% to approximately $1.5 billion and accounted for roughly 30% of Keysight overall. We saw solid growth in our design engineering software portfolio in 2024 reflecting the expansion of virtual prototyping across a broad range of industries. As a recognized thought leader in RF EDA, Keysight was selected to lead a US government joint public and private sector effort to leverage AI and machine-learning to automate and bring efficiencies to complex RF integrated circuit designs. In summary, Keysight has continued to sustain strategic progress and momentum through the downturn. The flexibility and discipline of our operating model has proven our ability to deliver strong financial results and healthy cash flows in a variety of economic conditions. We have positioned the business to emerge stronger as markets recover to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us and to create value for all stakeholders. Before I conclude, I'd like to sincerely thank our employees once again for all their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track-record of execution under a variety of market conditions. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1,287 million was above the high-end of our guidance range and down 2% or down 5% on a core basis. Orders of $1,345 million were up 1% as reported or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog increased $53 million in the quarter to finish at $2.4 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64.5%. Operating expenses of $497 million were up 5% year-over-year. Q4 operating margin was 26% or 28% on a core basis. Turning to earnings, we achieved $288 million of net income and delivered earnings per share of $1.65. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 174 million shares. For the full-year, Keysight generated revenue of $4,979 million, down 9% as reported or down 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was 65% down 60 basis points versus the prior year. We sustained investment in R&D at $871 million or 17.5% of revenue, while driving further operating efficiencies in SG&A, which declined 7% excluding acquisitions. Full year core operating margin of 26.5% was down 370 basis points continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resilience of the business. Net income of $1.1 billion resulted in earnings per share of $6.27. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $894 million flat as reported or down 2% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $591 million grew 4% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $303 million declined 6%. Altogether CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $393 million down 6% or 11% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 21%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents generating cash flow from operations of $359 million and free cash flow of $328 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 974,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $154 for a total consideration of $150 million. Full-year share repurchases totaled $439 million or 49% of the $905 million in free cash flow generated this year. Now turning to our outlook. We expect the demand environment to remain mixed and for recovery to occur gradually through the year, barring any further macro degradation. Our base case assumptions for FY'25 are for revenue growth at the low end of our 5% to 7% long-term target and earnings growth in line with our 10% target. As a reminder, the timing of ESI's annual contract renewals typically results in 40% to 45% of their full-year revenue being recognized in our fiscal first quarter with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the fiscal year. For the rest of the business, we are modeling the typical mid-single-digit seasonal decline in revenue from Q4 to Q1. As a result, we expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1,265 million to $1,285 million and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.65 to $1.71 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. Now a few modeling considerations for the full-year. Given the annual ESI contract renewals in Q1, we expect a material sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2. And over the same period, we expect a low-single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. At current debt levels, annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $70 million, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 14% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'25. With that, I will now turn it back to Paulenier for the Q&A.
Paulenier Sims: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. I guess my first question is, I want to ask you about the wireless piece of the business. It seems to be recovering. I think it was kind of mid-single-digit if I'm correct from the presentation order growth in the quarter. I'm just curious of how you, I guess, the past conversations suggested that's more of a stabilizing business as we move through this year. Has that started to change? Has your view of growth kind of recovery in that business started to evolve or deepen as we look through this next fiscal year?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, thank you, Aaron. Indeed a good quarter. We executed well and capitalized on the opportunities we saw. Specific to your question on wireless, we continue to feel more confident, I would say, after two quarters where the business has stabilized. And we're seeing more strengths on the infrastructure side where there's more activity from customers around Open RAN and 6G research. So that drives that. And on the devices side, it's lagging a little bit where customers still continue to be focused on ongoing standards evolutions. So, I mean, at this point, we continue to believe that the business will remain stable in '25. We'll call it when we see it. But we continue to feel good about the ongoing momentum we're seeing in our wireline business that's driven growth for commercial communications.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah and then as a quick follow up kind of sticking with looking at some of the segments. The Aerospace and Defense segment, I'm curious because this question come up with some investors. It sounds like you're pretty confident that, that business continues to progress on the growth profile that you outlined. But have you seen any areas of concern or any kind of churn in programs, et cetera, around some of the federal dynamics of spend? Any uncertainties around that, that you would point to?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think the Aaron, the long-term trajectory of that business is actually the one that is easiest to forecast given the budget clarity that typically gets and the priorities that get set both in the US and in allied nations. And if you look at electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite and other areas, those are the areas where defense modernization investments are moving to and we feel good about our position. Relative to the year, obviously, orders were slightly down year-over-year, but off of a record compare from a year-ago. And some of the wins that we had were systems wins, which take us a little longer to ship. So you haven't yet seen that in the revenue line. But as we look ahead, obviously, the short-term with the administration change in the US does bring some uncertainties. But even at times like in 2016 where that happened, we just had some business more out between quarters and so we'll monitor the situation, but we feel good about the current situation with regard to our business there.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open. I apologize. The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Yeah, two for me as well. First, could you -- you mentioned AI leading the strength in wireline, obviously a lot going on there, a lot of activity. Could you maybe expand a little bit on how big that business is getting for you and maybe some examples of newer areas that Keysight is being pulled into because of the move in AI? And then the second one, I just wanted to follow-up on the software services up to 39% of revenues here. Maybe just talk a little bit about that evolving part of the business model and how Keysight is going to be able to move that number further and maybe impact on gross margin as that moves higher as well? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Tim. Clearly, the wireline business has gained momentum this year driven by AI, but this is one of the examples of proof-of-concepts that I highlighted at Investor Day of last year. And so we're quite pleased with the way the opportunity has progressed. Our wireline business has exceeded over $1 billion in orders this year, growing at double-digit rates. And we service a broad set of customers in that industry, right. You think about silicon designers, system integrators, NEMs, hyperscalers and contract manufacturers. So it's actually a broad set of customers. But what's driving the activity in AI right now is actually a concentrated set of customers from hyperscalers that are investing in large infrastructure upgrades. So that's the effort. And the supply chain right now continues to be constrained. So investments are being made to unlock the supply chain to enable the scale to build. And so we're involved in that. We're capitalizing on that. But as we think about the future, we participated in some forums like the OCP and ECOC earlier this year and you can start to see the scale expand. It's not yet reflected in the results yet, but we start to build scale around compute, whether it's centralized or at the edge, power and thermal being very big issues for companies. Networking technologies are being adopted, maybe even faster than they were being adopted before this AI became a big trend. And our opportunities we're excited about are not just in the physical layer, but in the protocol layer, allowing customers to emulate how traffic flows through an AI infrastructure and therefore optimize their investments. So we're pretty excited about the opportunities long-term here and capitalizing on the near-term strength.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. And then as it relates to Software and Services, obviously continuing to see a nice mix-shift towards those portions of our business. And as I think the part of your question address gross margin, there could be, software portions of those businesses are accretive to Keysight's average gross margin, the services portions are slightly dilutive to Keysight's average gross margin, but overall both the service business has a lower expense structure, so both contribute nicely to profitability when you think about it from the operating margin line.
Mark Wallace: And then, Tim, I would just add, this is Mark. As far as the expansion, we've shown that it's more resilient to the current macro. Customers continue to invest in new methods shifting left on virtual simulation and emulation of their systems to help reduce costs and increase efficiencies and we're seeing that. And then the second part, of course, is the further leverage of some of our new assets like ESI, it being exposed to more of our customers in different regions, the US for Aerospace, Defense parts of Asia with a broad Keysight footprint in those regions. We see that as a driver for additional growth as we go forward.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Tim.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Jamieson with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Robert Jamieson: Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Just first on the Communications business. Just what kind of benefit could we see from the funding just in second half of '25? I mean is there much benefit there if that funding does get actually released and finally comes to fruition? And then I guess also any potential risk of that being reversed just given some of Trump's advisors at this point that have been anti-BEAD funding?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think the good thing about Keysight's business model in comps and in fact rest of our business is the broad set of customers we serve. That diversity and breadth is a source of great strength during times of change. And so while we do pick up some incremental business every year from new logos that come up because they're funded directly or indirectly there are some direct funding from government at times that flows into Open RAN. We've called some of those wins out and even the CHIPS Act, but we're not heavily tethered to any one of those things. So I would just say that those are incremental in some ways, but not as material as maybe the headlines enthusiastic especially because we're more involved in the R&D side of those labs and so we feel good. I think the momentum we see because of our renewed focus on go-to-market expansion that we had put in place with marketing is the continued attraction of new logos that we see across our business. It continues to be the focus for us moving forward as well.
Robert Jamieson: That's really helpful. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on tariffs just real quick. And just -- you guys have been dealing with this in one way or another for over eight years. Can you just talk about your previous strategies around your pivots in the APAC region, just whether it's been Huawei, ZTE or even the Trump tariffs, just how you've kind of managed that in the past?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I would just say it's probably, it's a question behind the question if I'm understanding you right is what are the implications of the US elections and therefore the policy changes that might ensue. And so like everybody, we're monitoring three areas, tax, trade, both tariffs and trade restrictions, right, the areas and along with defense spending that might ensue. It would be premature for us to comment on them, except to say that we've been pretty agile in ensuring compliance when there is a new government restriction and pivoting our sales resources to go after new opportunities. A potential offset could be and again I'm breaking my rule and speculating a little bit is if there were to be tariffs of the orders being discussed, many companies are looking to more of China into other areas in Southeast Asia and we remain prepared to capitalize on the opportunities if should that occur.
Robert Jamieson: Got it. Similar to like what we saw with reshoring and everything during supply chain disruptions, the benefit that we saw there.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Exactly.
Robert Jamieson: Great. Thank you very much.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.
Robert Mason: Good afternoon. And again nice jump on the quarter. Just with respect to your thoughts around 2025 revenue. Satish, I know you covered some of the segments, but just at a high-level I mean is it fair to think you think all of your major, I'll say segments, again we're talking wireline, wireless, automotive, general electronics, some of these verticals. Would all of them have an opportunity to grow in '25 do you think within the kind of mid-single-digit profile that you're talking about? Automotive sounds like maybe it was the most challenge, but I'd just like to get your thoughts there around all.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, that's good. Look, our job number one, Rob, was to stabilize the business and return to order growth, which we set out as a priority for the second half and I'm quite pleased that we've executed to that. Now looking at the facts, you'd say CSG has returned to growth in the -- for the full-year from an order perspective and EISG is yet to do that. So that sort of summarizes the mix demand environment. And just projecting forward, we expect continued sort of slow gradual recovery as we move into 2025. We're not baking in, in our base case all segments inflecting. And should that happen, we'll be prepared to capitalize on it. But our base case that Neil's called out at -- in his outlook section is for 5% revenue growth and 10% EPS growth for the year.
Robert Mason: Yes. Okay, that's helpful. And just as a follow up and maybe just directed to Neil just with the higher ESI revenue in the first quarter, I would assume that the gross margin will reflect that at least sequentially. Could you maybe give us a little bit of thoughts around your OpEx as you trend in from fourth quarter into first quarter, there's often some resets. I know seasonality as well influences that, but I'm just kind of curious what kind of trajectory OpEx is on as you enter the new year?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, let me just touch on a couple of seasonality related comments since you've opened the door to that. I think, first of all, as you mentioned with regard to gross margin, with the sizable uptick in ESI revenue, we would expect some gross margin upside from that business in Q1. Similarly, though, then as you move from Q1 to Q2, you have reverse effect as that revenue comes out of the model. So just if you put it on one side, you got to take it out on the other side. With regard to OpEx, just reminding you of some things that are kind of the norm for Keysight, we do salary administration for the entire company here in the first quarter of the year. So that will be impacting the P&L starting essentially now. And then as the business inflects from a period of contraction back to a period of growth, we have essentially our variable pay programs turning back on, which will increase OpEx here starting in the first half of next year.
Robert Mason: Very good. That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you so much for taking the question. On macro, I'm curious if you can speak to how that backdrop has evolved over the last quarter? It seems like there's some pockets that are getting better yet. It seems like others like auto that are maybe a little bit softer. So any general commentary on the macro backdrop you can provide? And then just as a follow-up on Aerospace, Defense can you talk about maybe what changed later in the quarter? You mentioned a very strong closeout to the quarter, particularly around the US. I'm just curious in terms of what changed and how maybe that's trended into the start of fiscal 1Q? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, why don't I start maybe by making some comments about macro and then we'll let Mark Wallace make some comments about the broader Aerospace, Defense business. So first of all, as Satish mentioned in his prepared comments, the results in Q4 were marginally better than we expected coming into the quarter. And so I think that's possible. A lot of that strength itself was in Aerospace, Defense and so Mark will talk about that. But I think as you think about macro changes and the previous question alluded to this as well, I think the automotive business is where we're seeing the most pressure significant pullback in spend around EV development at this point in time, which is impacting that industry pretty significantly. I think if you look across broader strength in wireline stability, maybe not yet a strong catalyst for growth in wireless, but at least stability, a nice forward momentum in Aerospace, Defense. I think with regard to semi, it's a question of timing. When do -- I think everybody is optimistic about a turn back on in semi. The question is when does that really begin in earnest. And then the industrial end markets, maybe the biggest question mark because I think some of that is going to be tied to how a lot of that capacity that was put in place during the '21, '22, '23 supply chain disruptions. Over what time is that capacity fully absorbed and people start to once again reinvest in manufacturing capacity? So that's kind of how we're thinking through the end markets from a macro perspective.
Mark Wallace: Yeah, and Matt, I think the Aerospace, Defense as Satish talked about, the focus on defense modernization has remained a top priority in the US and allied nations. We had continuing resolution in the first part of last fiscal year, the government fiscal year '24, which put some delays on new program starts. So as we entered into the fourth quarter with the government fiscal year-end in September, we saw increased spend as we would normally see, which was not certain because of delays in the budgeting process. So that was a big positive. We see continued investments from the prime contractors as well as the direct government in the US and the prime contractors in Western Europe as well as we've been talking about for many quarters due to the geopolitical situation that continues to unfold. So those factors come together. And then longer-term I think the areas that are promising for us continue to be around EMSO space and satellite and quantum with some of the government-funded research that's occurring in all parts of the world continue to offer us opportunities over the coming quarters.
Matthew Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for my first one, Satish, if I can go back to your comments earlier about not really embedding sort of inflection in all of the businesses and your 5% growth target for fiscal '25. How should I think about what kind of recovery or what your expectations are embedded in for semi-cap and general electronics? It seems like both are a bit mixed in terms of what you're seeing, but if you can just outline how you're thinking about those two areas in particular? And I have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik. I think for semiconductor fabs, just based on what we're seeing and the pipeline of opportunities we see for our wafer test solutions around silicon photonics and new memory topologies and some of the higher voltage types of wafers, I think that strength continues for us in somewhat a little bit offset by and that's the bigger part of our semi business, somewhat offset by a slowdown that a number of the semiconductor equipment manufacturers have reported as well. So you put that in the mix. We still think semi grows from these levels for us. And again semiconductor is, as you know, is roughly 10% of our total revenue at the company level. From a general electronics perspective, what we have started to see and again one quarter doesn't make a trend. So I just want to caution you. But I do think in Q4, we saw stability in manufacturing, which finally resulted in the underlying strength in research spending around next-generation technologies, the broad new customer logo, all of that return that business to growth. Again, it's just one quarter, but we think that stability in manufacturing continues as we move forward as well, which should give some -- which should return -- which should put EISG on return to order growth at some point in the year, it's difficult to call at this point.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, correct. And for my follow-up, maybe this is more for Neil. I think, Neil, a question you're getting a lot from investors is when they look at some of your previous margin targets that were a bit more longer-term for fiscal '26, you're not really that much different at this point from a gross margin perspective where the guidance was 66% to 67%, but you significantly had a gap to your operating margin target of 31% to 32%. How should we think about the drivers and sort of beyond volume leverage, how you're thinking about other drivers that get you closer to that target or is there something that sort of needs to be revaluated relative to those targets? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, I'd say a couple of things. So first of all, I think we're pleased with how gross margins have held up on the downside of the cycle. Obviously, we've gotten some benefit here from the addition of the ESI software business, but even if you look at the core Keysight business, the gross margins have held up pretty well in total on the downside of the cycle. I think when you start to think about those targets that we put out, 66%, 67% operating margin targets where again we're 150 basis points, 200 basis points off of that at current levels. And but we're significantly further off on the operating margin line. I think you need to look at the impact that the acquisitions are having in the short-run where we've made some acquisitions that are accretive to gross margins, but significantly dilutive to operating margins. And I think as we get those businesses integrated and start to operate them within the greater Keysight operating model, there's going to be opportunity for us to drive significant profit leverage on those acquisitions and start to close that gap on the operating margin side. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And Samik we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunities of this business. And you've seen when we can deliver above model growth rates, the sort of earnings power and leverage we have, we continue to operate this business in a disciplined way to be able to realize those and get us back on track.
Samik Chatterjee: Sure. Thank you. Thanks a lot.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Karan Juvekar: Hi. This is Karan on for Meta. Congrats on the quarter. So just starting on the Automotive side. Clearly, you remain quite positive on simulation. But outside of that, are there any other exposures that you have within auto that could cause a pickup in the business outside of maybe EV sales improving? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Yeah, so there are several parts to automotive. The part that we're seeing, the slowdown and project delays is around EV investments that have been quite robust over the last several years with battery test labs. So we're seeing a pause in that. We're seeing manufacturing demand also stay lower levels, but that's another part of our business that as inventories normalize that we should see some increasing flow through of manufacturing test for that. The part that's remained steady is the software defined vehicles or the ADAS, the autonomy side, where we have continued innovation crossing over multiple parts of our business into communications, sensor technology and so forth, and a lot of that is software as well. So there's a lot of work being done in that frame. And the other one that doesn't get as much attention, at least from these calls, but gets a lot of attention on the news is the infrastructure. So the charging infrastructure and the standards associated with those in every region of the world represents additional opportunities that we're pursuing. So long-term drivers of growth, secular drivers around AV, the manufacturing coming back on new advanced technologies remains an area of focus for us over many years.
Karan Juvekar: Got it. That's helpful. And then coming back to the AI side. Are there any areas that you see in your portfolio that you could maybe grow content or offer new products to sort of take advantage of the opportunity that you're seeing today? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, good question. I think as we mentioned, the more logical areas which we have seen growth come from to date or results come from to date are associated with the physical layer tools where we provide our oscilloscopes, our sampling scopes and other tools that we provide. And what we're seeing is a bigger opportunity for our emulation platforms we're still in early pilots with customers on. Again, it's a small, it's a concentrated set of opportunities today. We expect that industry and the impact AI is going to have to be broader and we're participating in enabling the ecosystem with the right set of tools all the way from design, emulation to test and our focus is on enabling our customers in the R&D parts of the workflow and it's a pretty rich opportunity for us. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the beat. And Mark, congratulations on your retirement.
Mark Wallace: Hey, thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask first about the operating margin in Communications. I think that was your best ever quarterly operating margin. It kind of took me by surprise. Curious what drove that and what the outlook is there?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. So obviously, we are very pleased with the results in CSG. Gross margins have held up very strong in that business. I think we see a tight, not only do we see a higher software content, higher recurring revenue from software, which obviously helps margins, but I think there's less margin diversity in the CSG portfolio than we see on the ESG side. So less impact from mix. From a profitability standpoint, I think we're very pleased that we're keeping our foot on the gas. On the R&D side, continuing to invest to position ourselves to capitalize on the upside while driving significant efficiencies and SG&A resulting in the strong profitability that we saw. So it was the strongest profitability we saw this quarter, not an all-time record, obviously, but very strong operating margins in CSG this quarter.
Adam Thalhimer: And then in EISG, as you think about the full-year, what are the growth offsets to the weakness in auto?
Neil Dougherty: You're talking about in '24 and '25?
Adam Thalhimer: For fiscal '25 what offsets in auto this year.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, I mean, I think as Satish look forward, as we look to semi and to the broader industrial markets, there is reason for optimism with some of the fab programs and the absorption of capacity that was put in place in prior years, again, likely to be more back-end loaded. We've talked about at the Keysight level of gradual improvement through the year. And so as Satish just said we would expect there is an opportunity for EISG, which has not yet returned to order growth to do so in the back half of the year. And I think that would be with some significant increase in the strength of the semi markets and some modest recovery in industrial end markets.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. Thanks, Neil.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
William Bryant: Hey, thank you for taking my question. You have Will on for Mark Delaney here. Just one on M&A. So, with the proposed Spirent transaction still ongoing, will Keysight be open to do other larger transactions in the near-term if one that made business and financial sense was available?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I would just say, look, we have reiterated a very strong organic growth strategy that we're focused on realizing. We've also identified specific markets that we have studied to pursue a selective M&A. And at this point, while we continue to evaluate targets, we always remain disciplined and we'll look at them. But it's not a matter of capital as much as bandwidths to pursue more deals given the deals that we've already announced, which we're working through.
William Bryant: No, extremely helpful. Thank you for that. And just one more on capital allocation. How should we be thinking about buybacks for fiscal '25? Any cadence commentary or any color that you can add there would be helpful. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, the only thing I would say is that obviously, we look forward to the close of the Spirent transaction, which will be a significant capital outlay for the company. And but we do expect that we will at a minimum continue with our buyback program at at-least the anti-dilutive level and then we'll be trying to strike a balance between starting to get the cash ready to close the Spirent transaction traded off against what we might see as opportunistic opportunities to do more on the buyback front.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Paulenier Sims for any closing comments.
Paulenier Sims: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining us today. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q3  (2024-08-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Keysight Technologies Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sierra, and I'll be your lead operator for today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, August 20, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's third quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran, and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussions are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, Citi and Goldman Sachs. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight executed well by delivering revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance in market conditions that were stable and consistent with our expectations. Second, orders of $1.25 billion was slightly above expectations and in line with prior year and growing low-single-digits sequentially. In a mixed demand environment, we continue to see stability and pockets of growth, particularly in commercial communications. The funnel of opportunities supports our outlook for second half orders to be above first-half orders followed by a more gradual recovery in 2025, barring any further macroeconomic degradation. Third, we remain confident in the strength of our business model and are intently focused on value creation for both customers and our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. First, we're strategically investing to deliver leading-edge capabilities as new technologies inflect and to return the company to our long-term growth trajectory. Second, we're expanding our SAM and growth opportunities through disciplined M&A. And third, we are committed to returning capital through share repurchases. In fact, we returned over $715 million or 78% of free cash flow over the past four quarters. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's third quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.57, above our expectations. And for the second consecutive quarter, we saw relative stability in both orders and revenue. Turning to our business segments. CSG returned to order growth in Q3. While revenue declined 8% year-over-year, we saw some modest improvement sequentially. Commercial Communications orders grew low-double-digits. Strong growth in wireline driven by AI, more than offset the year-over-year decline in a sequentially stable wireless business. Wireline orders grew for a third consecutive quarter, driven by robust investment in the re-architecture of data center networks for 400-gig, 800-gig and terabit data rates, AI model training and network performance. We're benefiting from the investments we have made to position Keysight ahead of this technology inflection. In R&D, we're enablers with our design and emulation solutions across the technology stack for key applications, including GPU servers, AI workload emulation and performance benchmarking. In manufacturing, AI cluster and switching deployments drove capacity demand this quarter, and we secured key wins in GPU rack connectivity applications with market-leading customers. Keysight also collaborated with Cisco and Panduit to demonstrate interconnect technologies in AI cluster networks to reduce power consumption. We're also actively engaged with customers in the ultra-ethernet consortium to define future network architectures for AI and high-performance workloads. In wireless, demand has been stable for the past three quarters, albeit at a lower level on a year-over-year basis. While customer spending remains cautious, the breadth of our solutions portfolio is enabling us to capture ongoing R&D investment in non-terrestrial networks, open radio access network deployments and release 18 of the 3GPP standard. Customers are also investing in scaling 5G and evaluating next-generation technologies. For example, at the recent IEEE International Conference and Communications, Keysight showcased early 6G technology together with Ericsson. Government incentives, particularly in U.S., Europe and Japan are driving development of a robust ecosystem to commercialize open radio access networks. This quarter, Keysight's open radio access network solutions enable state-of-the-art open testing and integration centers across the globe from Europe, to North America to Asia. Turning to aerospace, defense and government. Revenue and orders were down year-over-year, sequentially flat. The prolonged U.S. budget approval process has caused delays in appropriation of funding for new projects, which we expect to filter through over the next few quarters. In the interim, spending on defense modernization remains steady with healthy demand from U.S. primes and allied governments. Keysight recently expanded its engagement with U.S. government through joint cyber defense collaborative to enhance cybersecurity resiliency. In the quarter, we secured key wins with U.S. and European primes for spectrum operation applications. We also expanded our Quantum footprint with a multi-hundred Cubed application win with a key government customer. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue continued to normalize from a strong prior year declining double-digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability in orders and revenue on a sequential basis. In semiconductor, revenue was also down year-over-year versus an all-time high Q3 last year. Orders increased low-single-digits and were up strongly on a sequential basis. While certain segments of the market continue to work through excess inventory, higher performance requirements for AI workloads drove spending in advanced nodes, high-bandwidth memory and silicon photonics technologies. The investments that we have made specific to these market opportunities resulted in increased demand from foundry and memory customers for our parametric wafer test solutions. In automotive, orders and revenue declined double-digits. Lower auto manufacturing activity remains a headwind in the near-term. In new mobility, EV orders were lower as demand for some battery test and charging infrastructure investments were delayed, while AV orders grew mid-single-digits on a sequential basis. The opportunities in R&D continue to grow as customer engagement in transition to software-defined vehicles ramps. As an example, Riscure successfully completed the first car connectivity consortium digital key certification in conjunction with NXP. This certification strengthens trust in security of next-generation vehicles. It also further expands Keysight's security evaluation offering for the automotive industry. In general electronics, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel. There were pockets of growth in digital health and advanced research, where orders grew low-double-digits. Software and services revenues are resilient and grew this quarter while accounting for 39% of total Keysight revenue. Annual recurring revenue from software and services also increased year-over-year and in Q3 accounted for roughly 29% of overall Keysight. Our Eggplant software test automation platform is expanding with multiple consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We're also gaining early traction in sales channel leverage between ESI and Keysight to expand into select accounts and geographies. The collaboration resulted in a key win in the satellite communication space. Lastly, Keysight's design engineering software platform continues to grow. This quarter, we launched new releases for virtual prototyping and simulation capabilities, which address high-performance use cases across our communications, aerospace and defense and automotive end markets. In summary, the strength and differentiation of Keysight's business model is enabling us to outperform in a variety of economic conditions. We're well positioned to capitalize on technology inflections ahead of us and remain laser-focused on value creation for both customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Third quarter revenue of $1.217 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and down 12% or 13% on a core basis. Orders of $1.249 billion were essentially flat or down 1% on a core basis. Backlog at the end of the quarter grew $30 million to finish at $2.3 billion. Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 64%. Operating expenses of $484 million, were up 1% year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 7%, reflecting our cost flexibility and actions taken to-date. Q3 operating margin was 24% or 26% on a core basis. Year-to-date, core operating margin is down only 400 basis points, continuing to outperform Keysight's down cycle model and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. During the quarter, we amended our tax returns from 2020 onward to reflect an amortization deduction related to a prior period corporate restructuring. This change reduces our effective non-GAAP tax rate from 17% to 14% or 300 basis points for fiscal year 2024 and going forward. Turning to earnings. We achieved $275 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share, excluding the impact of the tax rate change. This tax change added an additional $0.16 to earnings per share, of which $0.11 relates to the first-half of FY '24 and $0.05 to Q3. All in, we finished the quarter at $1.57 in earnings per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $847 million, down 8% on both a reported and core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $572 million, declined 6%. While aerospace defense and government revenue of $275 million, was down 10%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 26%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $370 million, down 20% or 24% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 20%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points versus the prior quarter on slightly lower revenue. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $255 million and free cash flow of $222 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.07 million shares at an average price per share of approximately $140 for a total consideration of $150 million. Now turning to our outlook. We expect to finish the year slightly better than anticipated, with fourth quarter revenue in the range of $1.245 billion to $1.265 billion, and Q4 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. In closing, in an uncertain macro environment, we are executing on the dimensions that we control, capturing the current market opportunities and positioning Keysight for success as markets recover. With that, I will turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sierra, could you proceed with the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Definitely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking my questions. Orders were up slightly both sequentially and year-on-year after being down year-on-year for the prior six quarters. Maybe you can help us better understand how meaningful you think the pickup in orders is as a sign that the cyclical environment may be changing?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, hi Mark, thanks for the question. Obviously, we're encouraged by the continued stability that we see in our base business inflections that are material in our wireline business, some signs of rebound in semi, although it's too early to call it. So -- and then there's some incremental weakness in the automotive sector. So we put it all in the blender, and say, in this current environment, we're encouraged by this returning to slight year-over-year growth as we've seen, but it might be too soon to call a recovery at this time. And the key point is we're executing well, and we feel good about the -- our own portfolio and its differentiation and the investments we have made to continue to keep that going.
Mark Delaney: Thanks for that Satish. My other question was a follow-up on the orders. You mentioned AI as a positive contributor yet again to commercial communications. Maybe you can help us better understand what percentage of commercial communications orders are tied to AI at this point? And how impactful might AI be for revenue within commercial comms as you look out over the next 12 months or so? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thanks, Mark. Yes, we're quite pleased that commercial communications orders grew double-digits this quarter. Again, as I mentioned, we have a pretty diverse portfolio that caters to the entire communication cycle system with solutions. So you can think of wireless and wireline and the wireline ecosystem represents roughly about 40% to 45% of our commercial communications business, and it's inflecting driven by the AI spend. Now when you think about how big could be longer term, I think the answer is becoming quite clear that AI is going to be a pretty transformational technology that's going to lead to evolutions of multiple underlying waves of standards and technologies, but it's not yet played out. Today, the state of the affairs is it's a highly concentrated opportunity set driven by the big investments made by the hyperscalers. And it is a constricted sort of constraint, I should say, sort of environment from a supply perspective. So there are some challenges that the customers are working through. So we're seeing, and we're picking up some of that capital investments that are playing out through our manufacturing business that is rapidly expanding. But equally, we're making good progress, I would say, in engaging with standardization across the entire stack and in making meaningful contributions in R&D across compute, power and thermal, networking protocols and memory, all aspects of innovation that customers are playing into. But again, the ecosystem, I believe, will broaden over time. And our goal has been for the last 18 months to nest this opportunity, feel good about our market position.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question -- questions. I want to go back, it's been a little while, but at the Analyst Day a little over a year ago, you had outlined a revenue CAGR of 5% to 7%. And I'm curious as we kind of see the stabilization of orders, we think about the return of growth here. Is there anything that's changed as we start to think about the next fiscal year that you would put out there for us to think about relative to that 5% to 7% growth rate. And if so, I mean, why wouldn't we expect even a stronger growth rate just given the easy comps that you're looking at?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Aaron. Obviously, our long-term view of the opportunities and the underlying drivers remain unchanged. And so we would expect the business to trend back to those levels. That's point number one. However, look, '21 and '22 have been outsized years for our markets, and '23 was a flat year, flattish year. We continue to deliver value in '24 is a down year for the market. And so our first priority is to say that we can -- the business conditions have stabilized. That was our sort of first milestone, I should say. And as a sign of that, we feel good about what we had shared with you last quarter, which is that the second half orders would be greater than the first half, okay? So that's the first thing. Second is the shape of the recovery, as we've seen, it's still a pretty mixed environment. And we're not, at this point, factoring in an in-phase recovery, if you will, across all our multiple end markets. And therefore, we would, at this point, say we're thinking about this as a slow gradual recovery in 2025. However, the actions that we're taking in terms of things we control, our innovations, engagements with customers are all with an intent to maximize. And I feel good about Keysight's position. Obviously, we want to see some more progression in the funnel dynamics, which are trending positive, but you'll hear more from Mark later we want to see that progress a bit more before we can talk about what those growth rates might be for '25.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. I'm curious, as you -- Neil, I think a quarter or two ago, you talked about longer-dated backlog build or orders. I'm curious, any update on that and what you're seeing in the market today.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. The incoming order rate range reasonably stable in the upper single-digits level of mix. And on the revenue side, we are trending in that direction. We're not yet to the point where the revenues are at that level. But in the next quarter or two, we'd expect to achieve that.
Aaron Rakers: Yes, thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Nickman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Michael Allen: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Michael Allen on for Matt Niknam. I was just wondering if you could make a little more dig a little more to the aerospace, the ADG segment. Is -- or are these delays just kind of pushing more into the next quarter? Or is this kind of a slowdown of when you expect to see more of a year-over-year growth rate? Or just any more color on that.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I'd say the older arching trends given the geopolitics that we're under are positive, so that's number one. There is bipartisan support for budgets in defense in the United States and increasing support for raising budgets around the world. Japan just announced an increase and Europe is also focused on that. And I feel good about Keysights focus -- long-term focus we've had in defense modernization with Quantum solutions with solutions for ultra-magnetic spectrum operations, space and satellite. They're all aligned with the right priorities. Having said that, the budgets and appropriation timing does have an impact really hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But we like the pipeline that's building. The prime contractors increases are also something we monitor in the U.S., and we feel good that those will all eventually flush into orders for us. This year, obviously, we're lapping a full year of 2023 of record levels for order and revenue for the aerospace and defense business. So you'll see some -- the revenue levels are down. And to the point about the long-dated backlog, we have won some large systems businesses last year and this year, which will also convert into revenue next year. So I would say that the drivers have remained intact. Our position remains solid and the pipeline is strong. Thank you.
Michael Allen: Awesome, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Just on automotive. I mean, I think the broader weakness in the EV market is well known. But I saw you mentioned clients delaying projects. Are they looking to kind of restart maybe at the beginning of calendar 2025. just sort of gain a sense of the tone in those customer conversations.
Mark Wallace: Yes, David, this is Mark. It's hard to predict when the timing is for some of these projects. Some of them have very long processes associated with the procurement process, including proof of concepts. And then the projects themselves last many quarters, it falls into this category of some of the long-dated business that we've been talking about for quite a while. What I think we are seeing though is the continuous focus on innovation with our key automotive customers, the AV side and software-defined vehicles that is now migrating toward continued to show growth in the quarter sequentially. We are continuing to work with customers in all regions. So this is a global situation that we are well positioned for. And what I would look for in 2025 is some of the moderation of the slowness that we've experienced for many quarters around manufacturing as capacities are required to increase. And then I think given the regulatory situation, the political climate and the long-term commitments to e-mobility, I would expect the pause that we're seeing right now in some of these battery test and EV projects to begin gaining some momentum in the next several quarters.
David Ridley-Lane: Understood. And then a quick one for Neil. Just to check, when you said 14% tax rate going forward, that's a good baseline modeling assumption for next fiscal year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. For next year, we actually would expect it to that tax rate to hold for multiple years. The next thing that we're aware of is the U.S. GILTI tax rate, that's a tax on offshore profitability is scheduled to increase in 2027. So we'll need to evaluate the impact of that on Keysight once we get closer to that implementation date. And then the only other thing I would add is both of the current presidential candidates have prioritized tax legislation for the first year of new administration. Obviously, we don't have any way to assess what those programs would be like and so this doesn't account for anything that could be passed as part of a new presidential administration. But the status quo through '27.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. A couple of questions maybe on kind of the communications business. And what do you see as catalyst for improvement in fiscal '25 in that business, even if they are gradual. And then just maybe as a second question, I realize probably limited updates, but any update on Spirent acquisition. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would just say from a spiral, I'll take the second one first. Obviously, I'm going to be limited by what I can add. But I think an update to the situation is that we've received the shareholder approval Spirent shareholder approval for the transaction, and we're working through the regulatory process. And at this point, as we have stated before, we expect the transaction to be completed in the first half of fiscal '25. As far as your original question, I mean, it is quite exciting to see tremendous demand and inflection in the wireline business. As I mentioned before, it is concentrated and it is in a supply-constrained environment. So it remains to be seen how long the manufacturing build-outs go, but that's a near-term dynamic, and we're capitalizing on it. I think the R&D opportunities associated with the multiple areas that I touched upon the key sites, engaging with customers on. We feel like it gives us a good pipeline to go execute for the next three- to five-year horizon because there is going to be bigger wave. And with any of these technology trends, hard to really see it until it happens, so -- but we're engaged and we're making meaningful contributions for our customers. But I would expect stability in wireless to continue and some increase perhaps in deployment activity across the globe, which would give further some signs of growth to our component test business there. And then as I think about the wireline side of the business, continued investments in R&D, maybe some moderating manufacturing investments in the second half of next year. So that's sort of our thinking at this point.
Meta Marshall: Great, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. A couple of follow-ups for me. Thanks for color on the booking trends into the October quarter. But if I were just to take a look into the Q1 fiscal year '25. Historically, Q1 has been seasonally down in terms of booking. And is there anything with the startup of new fiscal year that would make this year any different than prior years? And I have a follow-up.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I think as it relates to that by '25, I think given visibility is probably a little bit premature for us to give too much guidance. As Satish said, we are expecting a moderate recovery into '25. I think as you have just noted, in Keysight's core business, we do typically see a sequential decrease in the mid-single-digits, orders and revenue as we move from Q1 -- Q4 into Q1. The one thing that we -- you will need to account for, however, is the ESI business has kind of the opposite seasonality, recognizing about 45% -- 40% to 45% of their revenues in the first quarter of Keysight's fiscal year. So you'll have the historic history would suggest throughout the Keysight business sequentially down in ESI sequentially up, and we'll have to see how that plays out given the market environment.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And maybe Mark can make a comment on the funnel dynamics.
Mark Wallace: Yes. So Mehdi, the funnel, as we said before, is trending positive, I would say. And as I look at where we are today versus three months ago, so this is kind of a sequential trend, we're seeing more funnel intake. So that's new opportunities coming into our pipeline. And we're seeing speed or the velocity at which some of those deals are going through the funnel and closing increasing as well. So that gives us a short-term funnel that supports our guide for Q4 and we'll continue to watch this carefully, but there are improving pipeline dynamics that we're seeing in the business.
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. Thanks for all the details. If I may just have a follow-up on that. As you look into next fiscal year, calendar year, is there anything with wireless infrastructure, anything that would help with some technology upgrade would -- and I mean like with the existing base stations would need to be upgraded from a not a stand-alone to a stand-alone? Or is there anything else that is out there that would also help with the upgrade? Or is the recovery in the core telecom wireless silicon is going to be driven by just a capacity expansion?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. It's a really good question, Mehdi. I think the thing about our business is we tend to be more on the R&D labs of our customers. So we're on the front end. So towards that end, we see continued progression of standards, release '17, release '18, release '19 coming in and new teams such as AI in the context of RAN becoming real, open RAN deployments or Open RAN interoperability labs around the world are scaling. So all those are, I would say, positive trends from a sequential basis. Obviously, were down from the peak as the capex cycle from telcos are down. But the stability in the business is good. We feel good about our engagements around these next-generation themes that I mentioned, and then some earlier activity around 6G is picking up, which we're making contributions to. So -- but again, I would expect that the 5G business will have some stability because there's more deployment activities around the world, and that should provide some more stability until six GRIs.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thomas Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon guys, nice quarter.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Hi, thank you, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Sorry if I missed this, but the sequential revenue growth that you're looking for in Q4, is that weighted more towards communications? Like do you expect both segments to be sequentially up?
Neil Dougherty: One moment. But yes, so this is the seasonal uptick, obviously, we see in both businesses. It's probably going to skew a little bit more towards the comms business than the industrial business at this point, given some of the pressure that we continue in manufacturing and automotive that Satish just shared.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And typically, end of the year, Adam, we would expect a seasonal uptick in our Aerospace and Defense business, which has always been the case. So that's another contributor as well.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And on the semiconductor side, last quarter, you talked about fabrication delays. I think you said it might come back late Q4 or 2025. Can you just give an update there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. On the semi side, I'd say that the project activities are returning and we started to see some sequential growth. The pipeline remains solid and especially around memory, which is stronger and technologies such as silicon photonics, where we had invested with customers. And now AI is driving a higher sense of urgency to pull the trigger on those activities. Some parts on the logic side, still, it's still a mixed environment on the logic side. But we feel good about sequential recovery in that business.
Adam Thalhimer: Great. Thanks guys.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Jameson with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.
Rob Jameson: Hi there. Yes, just a quick question on the auto exposure here. I know you talked about the EV weakness and some of the political headwinds there. But on the autonomous vehicle side, just would look to kind of have you expand a little bit on how that leads on your core communications? And maybe some color around what that opportunity might look like in the long term? And how much as a percentage of total orders that is for that business?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So thank you. As you have rightfully noted, the automotive business and the automotive marketplace is transforming, right? And I think for Keysight historically, very low exposure in that area. And as we have said before, we have grown the business to $500 million almost from a very small base. And a big part of that was really manufacturing, one-third of the business is manufacturing and production where we are engaged in the electronics manufacturing of it, and we have a differentiated position there. Two-third of the business, obviously, is all new mobility EV that Mark Walls talked about earlier and AV as well. And it's a marketplace that continues to transform. On one dimension you have Chinese battery, call it, commoditization pressures that customers are feeling. And yet the regulations around batteries and their safety needs dictate more testing there in region. And on the other side, I think the commercial ecosystem is starting to engage directly with automakers. And that's what Mark defined as the software-defined vehicle opportunity set with silicon software combining and it really plays to Keysight's traditional strength, and it's more an extension of what we do for traditional comps customers and we're able to take those and go to market for them. Mark, anything further?
Mark Wallace: Yes. No, you hit it on the last part. I was going to point out that this crosses over many parts of our business going back many years from our semiconductor and our comms EDA design tools to more and more our security and cyber types of tools that go into these environments with silicon. They obviously leverage our strengths in commercial comms, which we've been capturing for many years with communication standards, connecting vehicles to everything into the components that are used to sense as well as the computational capabilities and the standards that go within the digital standards and the optical standards that go within the vehicle itself. So that's the -- from radar to connected cars, this is crossing over multiple areas where Keysight has a leadership position, and that's why we continue to see such an active customer landscape.
Robert Jamieson: That's really helpful. Perfect. And then I guess just one last one. I know there was a lot of volatility in the end of July. But just curious on demand trends through maybe the back half of the quarter and an early look into August. Was there any material changes or is it just kind of like plotting along or any positive negatives that we should be aware of?
Mark Wallace: Now, we saw ramping in the quarter from month to month, but it wasn't necessarily unusual. We ended our first half in May, and that typically pull some business in because we -- most of our sellers are on a six-month quota. So we had to start a little bit with the depleted funnel, but then we quickly grew that in. As I said, what we've seen throughout the last three months is the positive funnel dynamics, which is more funnel intake and then moving that business through the funnel. So I would say it was a fairly typical seasonality to the quarter, and we're two weeks into Q4 now.
Robert Jamieson: Great, thank you.
Mark Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.
Priyanka Thapa: Hi, this is Priyanka Thapa on for Samik Chatterjee. Just one question. You stated that you have a huge opportunity set because of hyperscaler investments. Are these hyperscalers direct customers for test equipment relative to the AI data center equipment testing? And which kind of areas can you potentially see this exposure to hyperscalers broadening out over time? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Priyanka. So what I stated was obviously the hyperscaler investment in digital infrastructure upgrade and the capital equipment being deployed to upgrade the networks to be more AI ready, if you will, is proliferating through the ecosystem and the large supply chain, and we're benefiting from the manufacturing exposure there. So that was point number one. But we're increasing our exposure as some of the hyperscalers enter into silicon programs and build their own organic capability, that's a growing customer base that we're continuing to expand into. We're also participating in consortiums for more open standardization that some of the hyperscalers are leading. So we're making a growing contribution there. And we feel good about our ability to take the physical and protocol layer assets into this marketplace and provide total solutions for customers, not only in traditional areas you would expect us to in computation or connectivity, but also into emulating training and inference scheme so that AI can scale effectively.
Priyanka Thapa: Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you all for your questions. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Well, thanks, Sierra, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences this quarter and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2024 Q2  (2024-05-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Keysight Technologies Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sierra, and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded today, Monday, May 20, 2024, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.  
 I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under Financial Information and Quarterly Reports.  
 Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impacts of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors.  
 Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Baird and UBS. And now I will turn the call over to Satish. 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on 3 key headlines. First, Keysight executed well in a market environment that was largely unchanged from the first quarter, revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 exceeded the high end of our guidance. Second, orders of $1.2 billion were in line with prior quarter. We saw pockets of growth and stability across multiple end markets even as customer spending remained constrained. Our base case scenario for the full year is unchanged with the revenue relatively stable from Q2 to Q3 and orders increasing modestly in the second half.  
 Third, our deep customer collaborations and relationships are strong and continue to inform our future road maps. These engagements reinforce our confidence in the long-term secular growth trends of our markets. The pace of innovation is accelerating across multiple vectors, and while remaining disciplined, we are investing to increase our differentiation and to capitalize on the waves of technology inflection ahead of us.  
 Now let me begin with a brief overview of Keysight's second quarter performance. Revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.41 were above our expectations. Revenue and orders continued to normalize from the strong prior year, but were stable on a sequential basis, excluding ESI seasonality. We delivered operating margin of 24% reflecting a healthy gross margin of 65% and the cost actions and discipline that we have exercised to date.  
 Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined versus prior year, which benefited from robust backlog conversion. On the demand front, orders were flat year-over-year and grew 4% on a sequential basis. Investment in defense modernization continue to drive activity in aerospace, defense and government, and we were pleased to see commercial communications order growth for the first time after 6 consecutive quarters of declines.  
 Wireline orders grew on a robust demand for our differentiated AI data center solutions. These include a new AI test platform that is being used by several industry leaders to emulate AI workloads and benchmark network performance.  
 Hyperscaler customer engagements remained high as they accelerated their AI application development. We deepened our R&D collaboration with NVIDIA on next-generation communication technologies this quarter. We also saw strong demand for AI infrastructure solutions, including test and validation of 400 and 800 gig transceivers and ultra high-speed interconnects in GPU-based compute systems.  
 Our advancement of leading-edge network innovation was on display at the Optical Fiber Conference, where we demonstrated the industry's first 1.6 terabit Ethernet test solution in partnership with industry leaders. In wireless, there are some encouraging signs of incremental improvement in the industry outlook as parts of the ecosystem continue to normalize. Our latest suite of 5G solutions launched over the past year is enabling ongoing investment in evolution of 5G standards, nonterrestrial and open RAN.  
 With the first round of NTIA grants to enhance testing of interoperability, performance and security of open RAN networks, we secured key wins with several customers in the U.S. We also saw increased demand for chipset R&D as well as component production.  
 Earlier in the quarter, we partnered with industry leaders to showcase new products and solutions at Mobile World Congress including nonterrestrial network chipset development with Qualcomm.  
 Turning to Aerospace, Defense and Government, defense modernization spending continued in radar and spectrum operations, space and satellite and signal monitoring. We saw a healthy demand from the U.S. government and primes in the quarter. After several continuing resolutions, the 2024 U.S. defense budget was approved in late March. It includes a 5% increase for research, development, test and evaluation, which is expected to drive incremental program spend.  
 Strong demand for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications resulted in significant wins at U.S. and European Prime. We expect this trend to continue into the second half and 2025.  
 Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue continue to normalize from a record prior year, declining double digits as expected. Customer spending and market conditions remain muted, but we saw relative stability on a sequential basis.  
 In semiconductor, the industry outlook is improving with projections of recovery in 2025. Inventories are coming down to more healthy levels and demand is picking up in certain areas such as high-bandwidth memory. Additional new fab installations were announced this quarter, in the near term, foundry customers are working through delays in existing projects and expect production to begin in late '24 and '25. Consistent with this backdrop, we saw improvement in our memory-related business and ongoing steady demand for Keysight's proprietary laser Interferometer positioning systems.  
 In automotive, revenue was sequentially stable when excluding acquisitions. We had a steady demand for both our EV and AV solutions. Beyond the headlines, consumer adoption of EV continues to grow, although at a slower pace. The development of cost-effective, longer-range batteries and a more robust charging infrastructure remains a strategic priority for OEMs and governments in a very competitive market.  
 During the quarter, we expanded our global battery test footprint with a new large Gigafactory customer in Europe. We're also pleased with the addition of ESI to our automotive and simulation software solutions portfolio. The business is tracking well to both top line and profit expectations. This quarter, ESI expanded its multi-decade collaboration with Volkswagen Group, establishing a joint material testing and intelligent simulation lab in Asia. This collaboration will advance automotive simulation technology and drive new to industry standard safety and efficiency forward in the region.  
 In general electronics markets, customer spending remains constrained, particularly in manufacturing, China and the distribution channel, we do continue to see growth in digital health and advanced research supported by government funding in Asia and the U.S., such as the CHIPS Act. This quarter, we expanded our partnership with EMVision in Australia to enable innovation in novel point-of-care medical imaging technology and analysis.  
 As a key element of our solution strategy, software and services orders and revenue growth continued to outpace overall Keysight. At approximately 39% of total revenue, software and services enhance the differentiation of our solutions and are more resilient in current market conditions. Within the chip domain, next-generation performance demands are driving an exponential increase in system level design requirements and complexity. Keysight simulation and emulation software capabilities enable our customers to address these challenges and accelerate time to market for their advanced systems and chips. We recently introduced Quantum Pro, an integrated EDA solution for Cubic design and the development of quantum computers.  
 In addition, we launched a new solution for die-to-die interconnect simulation, which is a key step in verifying performance of heterogeneous and 3D integrated circuit designs commonly known as chiplets. Looking ahead, the pace of technology innovation and digitization is accelerating and proliferating across multiple industries and use cases. Keysight is investing today both organically and inorganically to capitalize on these future technology waves and inflections.  
 In addition to steady organic investment in R&D, we are expanding our solutions portfolio and our served addressable markets through M&A. This quarter, we announced our intent to acquire Spartan Communications, a highly complementary business in network analytics. We also completed the acquisition of Riscure in the quarter, expanding our automated security assessment capabilities and solutions for semiconductors, embedded systems and connected devices.  
 In closing, I would like to thank our employees once again for consistently delivering value to our customers and shareholders. The Keysight team's high performance and winning culture is key to our success and a competitive differentiator. While it's difficult to call the timing of the recovery, we're encouraged by pockets of growth that are emerging, the relative stability of investment levels and the strength of our customer collaborations Consistent with the Keysight leadership model, we remain disciplined and continue to streamline operations to ensure strong financial performance in these dynamic market conditions.  
 As we look beyond the current period of normalization, the long-term secular growth trends driving our business are intact. Taken together, our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions, strong customer relationships, technology leadership and durable financial model positions us well into a market recovery. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. 
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Second quarter revenue of $1.216 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 13% or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.219 billion declined 8% or 9% on a core basis. As a reminder, Keysight's historical first to second quarter seasonality was muted by the cadence of the ESI business with approximately half of ESI orders and revenue recognized in the first quarter of the fiscal year. Excluding ESI, orders grew 4% sequentially, and revenue was in line with Q1. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog.
 Looking at our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 65%. Operating expenses of $496 million were down 2% year-over-year even with the addition of ESI and Riscure. Excluding these acquisitions, SG&A expenses were down 10% or $29 million, reflecting the flexibility of our cost structure and actions taken to date. Q2 operating margin was 24% or 25% on a core basis. Despite a 14% decline in core revenue in the first half, first half operating margin declined 400 basis points, outperforming Keysight's downside model expectations and demonstrating the financial resiliency of the business. 
 Turning to earnings. We achieved $247 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.41 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 175 million shares. 
 Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $840 million down 10% or 11% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $563 million declined 10% while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $277 million was down 11%. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $376 million, down 17% or 21% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 58% and operating margin of 19% due to the seasonality of ESI profitability, lower revenue volume and some unfavorability in mix. 
 Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $110 million and free cash flow of $74 million, which reflected higher cash taxes and the timing of collections in the quarter. 
 Share repurchases this quarter totaled 302,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $153 for a total consideration of $46 million. 
 Now turning to our outlook. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.180 billion to $1.200 billion and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.36 and based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. As we look to the full year, our base case scenario remains the same and assumes a mid-single-digit increase in revenue from Q3 to Q4, which implies full year revenue of approximately $4.9 billion. 
 In closing, we remain disciplined and focused on what we control, while investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets normalize and recover. Keysight's customer focus, technology leadership and broad solutions portfolio give us confidence in the long-term trajectory of the business and the ability to outperform in a variety of market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sierra, would you give the instructions for the Q&A, please? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. 
Robert Mason: So I'm thinking -- it sounds like your base case for the year, obviously, is still intact. Just thinking through that more thoroughly, the orders typically in the third quarter maybe down -- maybe flat to down slightly sequentially. And then you have better order trends in the fourth quarter seasonally.  Should we think this is, again, still tied more to book and ship as you think about the revenue upticking in the fourth quarter? Or any help you can provide just on the clarity for that slope? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So yes. So first of all, I agree with your assessment of the typical seasonality of our business as we typically move from Q2 to Q3, I'd say the small downtick in both orders and revenue would be typical for seasonality, admittedly hard to find over the last couple of years, COVID, recovery supply chain. But if you went back in time, that would have been the typical seasonality. Then with the mid-single-digit uptick into Q4 driven by [indiscernible] annualized sales cycle or second half sales cycle as well as the strength of aerospace defense business tied to the government fiscal year-end. And I think that's largely what we're seeing here this year as well as we -- in terms of our expectation for the remainder of the year. 
Robert Mason: Very good. And then just as a follow-up, could you dig a little bit deeper into your overall Wireline business, the AI data center piece, obviously, seeing some strength. I'm just curious with these new platforms that are rolling out, what stage of adoption are we seeing with those? And just comment more broadly on the Wireline business over and beyond the AI data center exposure? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Rob. I think this quarter for the first time in 6 quarters, our commercial communications orders grew, and as a result of the inflection that we're seeing in the wireline business associated with AI. And it's still very early days as the world continues to look at all of the applications that could be launched leveraging AI at scale. And I would say it's still very early days even for Keysight's business. So what we're seeing is probably a first inflection, I would say.
 The big headline that we've seen in the last couple of quarters and that accelerated this quarter was the push from customers to lead in the hardware infrastructure space and how critical it's performance is for cost, for energy and in general for the user experience in the AI application. For Keysight, in our Wireline business, having the breadth of the portfolio that caters to networking, computing, storage, interconnects -- and we're able to make contributions that are broad, but we're just getting started is the way I would frame it up -- the heterogeneous environment there is helping us play a critical role, and we're also engaged in a number of these standards bodies. So we saw strong double-digit growth in the business for the Wireline business this quarter, and also sequentially a strong uptick in Q2. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. 
William G. Bryant: This is Will Bryant on for Mark Delaney. So in your press release, you all reiterated that you are assuming modest order growth in the second half of the fiscal year. Can you give us some additional color on what gives you confidence that the orders will pick up in the second half? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think what we have said is the market environment remains unchanged. And as we said in the previous call, we're not -- our base case does not assume any significant market recovery, right? So barring that is just a seasonal uptick in Q4 as Neil just referenced coming from our aerospace defense business. But we are continuing to feel that the demand environment is stabilizing. I would say, as I pointed out earlier, Wireline inflections and demand remains strong. I'd say the aerospace defense is stable. And our ISG business, which had -- which had seen 4 quarters, including the current quarter of declines stemming from normalization and manufacturing is also starting to show some seasonal -- or starting to show some sequential growth, I should say, this quarter, all of which we view as sense of stability in the business. 
William G. Bryant: That's helpful. And just 1 quick follow-up on just thinking about how you guys are managing OpEx as you guys are planning the business in these volatile end markets. Could you give us any additional color about what you want to manage OpEx? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. First, I'd remind you of the statements we made a quarter ago that we do expect if excluding the additional OpEx from our acquisitions, our total OpEx spending to be down about 3% on a year-over-year basis with all of that savings coming from the SG&A line items as we look to maintain our investments in R&D to ensure that the business is well positioned to capture the upswing when it occurs. .
 I think we're looking in terms of the types of actions that we're taking. We're obviously always looking for ways to streamline operations and drive efficiency in our business. I think if you take a look, you'll notice that over the course of the last 4 quarters, our headcounts are down about 5% as we look to absorb attrition. We've provided some incentives for folks to transition into retirement, and been absorbing those during this period of time. 
 In addition, we obviously have a very flexible cost structure -- cost structure has been flexing as expected, which is also contributing to the financial performance in line with our model. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. 
Aaron Rakers: I'll just put them both out there right away. I guess on the EISG segment. I'm curious on the semiconductor space. Can you, first of all, help us appreciate the size of that or any kind of clarity you could give in terms of that piece of ESIG. And within that, how do we think about these fab projects being delayed into late calendar '24 and into '25 and the timing when that starts to turn more positive. And then I'd also be curious on the interconnect side, you mentioned chip-to-chip interconnect simulation stuff. I'm curious how much of an opportunity that presents? Who are you competing against there and just kind of framing that out as far as opportunities as we look forward? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I'll take the first question, sizing of [semi and then] hand it over to Mark to make some comments on the market. What we've said is that our semi business is kind of 10-ish percent of total Keysight maybe a little less. 
Mark Wallace: Okay. Yes. And then in terms of the fabs and the delays of timing, we've been watching that closely over the last several quarters, we have seen some movement. We've said before that our funnel gives us about 6 months of visibility out into market timing, and we're starting to see some activity that would suggest that some of those fab expansions that have been delayed the funding associated with them should be beginning to show some signs of CapEx spend towards the end of the calendar year. But we're watching it very closely. 
 We have very deep relationships with the customers -- and certainly, the underlying drivers for advanced process technologies related back to AI are continuing to be very strong as these applications begin to grow at scale. 
Satish Dhanasekaran: And then last point of you question was on interconnect -- last part of your question, I didn't want to miss it. It was our interconnect technologies. And as you think about data center coming from today's node sizes of $300,000 or $250,000 to $1 million and beyond. At some point, I think interconnect has become very important. The nature of those interconnects, the high performance requirement associated with them are critical, and therefore, interoperability testing needs are key and key sites, differentiated technologies across our core product line is playing a critical role already, and we'll continue to play a critical role moving forward to help our customers. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. 
Meta Marshall: Maybe a couple of questions for me. First, just on ESI, -- any commentary in terms of ability to sell that product to other customers as you get it integrated in or just any commentary on early performance. And then just maybe as a second question, any update on long-dated orders or contribution of orders from long-dated orders worth noting? . 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Meta. Again, we're quite pleased with the acquisition. The performance in the first half has exceeded our initial plans, so which is good. Again, I view this simulation and emulation as a long-term strategic priority for the company and ESI was clearly -- gave us some differentiated capability to go pursue it. The culture fit 1, 2 quarters in is re-traded because our teams are working seamlessly, the collaborative culture, the focus on technology, all of those things are headed in the right direction. .
 And from a revenue acceleration perspective, that's the focus for the team, right? It's -- we're really prioritizing taking ESI's core products into aerospace defense in the U.S. and increasing our exposure with Asian auto manufacturers. I'll let Mark make some comments on how the sales team is doing on that front. But overall, quite pleased with the acquisition. 
Mark Wallace: Thanks, Satish. It's been an exciting quarter and half for us as we've begun to work more closely across different geographies, really the plan that we put in place back in late Q1 continues to be the plan we're executing around our common areas of focus from a customer standpoint in North America, where ESI is underexposed with aerospace defense. And then in both directions around auto, especially in Europe, we're seeing opportunities open for both our classic business and working closely with ESI. 
 So momentum. These are fairly long cycle, sales cycles many months to get to a point of closure, but we're already starting to see some progress in our funnel, and I'm encouraged with the way the teams are working together. 
Neil Dougherty: And just a quick comment on long-dated orders. The mix of long-dated disorders within the quarter were consistent with the recent past. 
Operator: Our next question comes from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. 
Matthew Niknam: Just 2, if I could. First, maybe big picture if you could talk a little bit about the Spirent deal, why now and maybe some of the strategic rationale behind that deal? And then secondarily, just as we think about operating cash flow, maybe for Neil, if you could just maybe talk a little bit about some of the drivers of relative softness this quarter and how to think about working cap and some of the other items that go into that for the second half of the year? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. As far as being a company we've known for some time, we used to have a partnership with them. And I think the rationale headlines are: first, it's a SAM expansion opportunity. You think about the portfolio aspirant with focus on service assurance, positioning really a good fit to that network analytics expansion opportunity I laid out at the Investor Day. And then when I think about the financial aspect of this deal, I think it creates value for customers and more scale and synergies inside the Keysight environment, but equally for our shareholders, it's a good deal from a point of view of -- it meets our hurdles, M&A hurdles internally and it's accretive to gross and operating margins post integration. 
 So we feel really good about the opportunity. We're continuing to work through the regulatory process right now. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. And then getting to your question on free cash flow and working capital. So obviously, free cash flow is a little bit softer within the quarter, but pointing out north of $350 million through the first half of this year. .
 In terms of within the quarter, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we do have seasonably higher tax payments in the second quarter of the fiscal year. That was expected. And then the timing of revenue over the past couple of quarters was not conducive to high collections within the quarter is the best way to say that. We actually entered the quarter with about $90 million lower accounts receivable than we entered the prior quarter. And then because of Lunar New Year and other things, we got off to a bit of a slow start in February. And so that meant that the -- those Q2 revenues that otherwise would have been collectible within the quarter was -- we were off to a slow start. 
 I think your question about working capital, just a couple of comments. So while collections were lower within the quarter, we do not have any material increased risk around accounts receivable, our allowance for bad debt is very low, and we tend to not have issues in that area. We do, however, have significantly increased inventory over the past couple of years, largely stemming from various things related to the supply chain. We delayed for a long time, the refresh of our demo portfolio so we could take new products and get them to customers. when supply chains normalize, we did refresh our demo portfolio and took the existing demo equipment and put it under a used equipment pool, which is a benefit now because it gives us yet another opportunity to serve customers. And we also had to make some investments because some of our vendors were cleaning up their part list, we had to make some longer-term investments in the assurance of supply -- in inventory. 
 So I feel pretty good about it. I think there is a path to reducing inventory over time, but it's going to be hard to market recovery. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. 
David Ridley-Lane: Several competitors have pushed out their own recovery time lines. You're obviously sticking with yours. What are the 1 or 2 things that you would point to in the results that give you the most confidence in that outlook? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, David. I think, look, we look at it 1 quarter at a time. And so far, our focus has been on execution in our discussion with customers, I would say that's the most relevant 1 as many customers have commented that they are going through the bottom. -- has their own economics improve. They've come back and they have doubled down on the programs and projects that we've been in discussions with. So that inflecting nature that correlation to their business is perhaps the most important 1 that we look at. 
 Big picture, when we start to look at macro factors, I would say, SIA, you look at even smartphone sales, PC sales, other things, you start to see some improvement along with the PMI indices that are growing. So while not calling for timing or magnitude of recovery at this point, we remain focused on execution. The 1 tactical area that we -- the data that we have in-house is on our pipeline, and I'll have Mark make a comment on the pipeline. 
Mark Wallace: Yes, David, I would just simply say our pipeline supports this expectation of the modest improvement in H2 orders driven by the seasonality in Q4. Funnel intake, which is growth of new business into the funnel is up in pockets with the green shoots that we've already spoken about with AI and wireline memory, and continued demand in the longer-term secular businesses that we've spoken about with aerospace, defense and EV. We have not yet seen the lift from the U.S. defense budget being signed in the middle of March. So we hope to see some of that come through as well. 
 And again, velocity is key, and we're starting to see some of that pick up, which shows some confidence in our customers. 
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. Okay. And just a quick follow-up. Obviously, you have your internal plans in terms of the cost actions you're taking. I was a bit surprised that the sort of the magnitude of the restructuring cost in the quarter though. Did you take expanded actions? Or is this all part of the plan as envisioned 3, 6 months ago? 
Neil Dougherty: No expanded actions. I think if you're looking at the reconciliations that were provided -- the category is actually listed as restricting other and there was a modest legal settlement that occurred within the quarter as well that's skewing that number higher. 
Operator: Our next question today comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis. 
Adam Thalhimer: In the EISG segment in the ESG segment, do you see revenue -- do you see further weakness in revenue and margins in the back half? Or do you think things improve versus Q2? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I would say the answer is twofold, right? One is on the order line, we think the demand environment improves a bit as we go into the second half, especially Q4, driven by some of the semiconductor spend that we're expecting to land in Q4, but again, revenue would be offset because some of the business that we book in the EISG does have a bigger percentage of long-dated sort of backlog items. So it is twofold. We expect that Neil can give us -- we would expect that revenue would be -- would face some headwinds in the second half even as orders improve. . 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. As you think about the margin situation in EISG, I highlighted kind of 3 factors, right, the seasonality of ESI, which is strongly profitable in Q1 in a modest loss position in the remainder of the year, that is impacting ISG profit. But by far the biggest -- the biggest driver is the revenue decline, right? So revenues down sharply here in Q2. And I think as long as we're operating in these revenue ranges, it's going to be reasonably range-bound in the current operating margin vicinity. 
Mark Wallace: And just want to add on the order line. The EISG business in Asia went in about 2 quarters after CSP. So that was just lapped at the end of Q2. So that gives us some confidence that the comparison lease will be getting easier in the second half. 
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then 1 for commercial communications on -- can you help us frame the AI data center opportunity for you guys versus 5G at the peak? 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, first of all, from a timing perspective, it's very early days for the AI opportunity primarily because there are obviously logical areas where we engage with customers, but we have several active collaborations underway around silicon, 1 on real-time training of clusters, interconnects, testing methodologies for benchmarking AI, protocol aspects of the new standard [EUEC] transceiver manufacturing interoperability. So while we are in booking some business today, and we have some several active collaborations underway which are quite promising, and the ecosystem of customers that we serve will expand over time. 
 Very hard to compare and contrast with 5G or wireless side. But I think -- the key for the commercial comps business has always been to increase our emphasis in early R&D because we know that it makes us much more strategic and critical to customers. Second is to maintain diversity in application sets. So we have both equal focus on wireless and wireline that give us ways to drive growth by market. And then we feel really good about our competitive position on our portfolio strength and it's only going to grow as we -- as the industry adopts AI at scale. 
Operator: Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Two follow-ups. Satish, I'm trying to better understand how you're managing business beyond the second half -- and I want to go back to the Analyst Day, you talked about the 5% to 7% longer-term revenue growth. And obviously, 2023 -- fiscal year '23, turned out will be a lot worse. So it helps you with a lower base. And if I even think of the low end of that longer-term revenue target range, your revenues in FY '25 and '26 would need to be up double digit. And what I want to understand, as I noted earlier, I want to see how you're planning how you're running the operation. I don't see any 1 killer app on the horizon. There are several smaller killer app. And to what extent M&A is going to be part of your strategy to hit that revenue target? And I have a follow-up. 
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. So I know you asked several questions in one, but let's make sure I hit all of them. But I'll start by saying, look, we feel really good about our long-term growth expectations for the business. And as we laid out the 3-pronged growth strategy at Investor Day, we see these technology trends are accelerating. We see transforming industries increasing our ecosystem of customers we can serve, and we see market dynamics with governments around the world investing for organic IP. So none of those have fundamentally changed, and we feel like we're in a good position. And if you look at our strategy through this downturn is to continue to invest in R&D in a prudent way, but really focus those investments on where our customers need the most help, especially in the R&D labs of our customers making us more strategic and the cost actions that we've taken in navigating this downturn has been largely on the SG&A line. So we feel good about the opportunity that we see ahead. .
 As far as the -- our ability to deliver to those results, clearly, while we feel good, it is possible that the time line pushes out a bit given the decline that we've had in '24. And so a lot depends on the timing of the recovery. But if history is any measure, every time we've had strong pullbacks, we've had stronger uptrend as well in terms of orders. So we continue to watch that strategically. Software and services has been an area of focus for us. Software and Services now is roughly 40% of the total company, which is a good trend, and we want to keep driving that higher -- and as I've reiterated before, we look at several deals. We've looked at over 350, 400 deals in the company, and we've only done about 20. So we're very selective in our strategy. It's not about revenue. We look strategically at the areas where we feel like we want to make a bigger contribution and where we can bring value to those assets when they come inside Keysight. So there is -- from that point of view, there's really no change. We're an organic first company. We believe in investing with our customers to create long-term value. 
Mehdi Hosseini: Great. And then maybe follow-up and put the question to Neil. As you think about these longer-term targets and inventory cash flow normalizing, should we assume that your free cash flow would go back to the historical average of like high-teen percentage of revenue that was very significant when we were going through the up cycle a couple of years ago? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I think over time, Mehdi, but I think in the short run, the way we think about free cash flow internally is we look for a relatively high conversion of non-GAAP net income into free cash flow. And we've talked about running that in the 90% or higher range. And so while we don't have a specific free cash flow guide that we put out there, I think that's how we think about it over the longer term. The 1 thing that I would say, and you can see this by looking back in our history, is that there are periods of time where we have kind of nonstandard cash flow items that can reduce that level of free cash flow conversion. And specifically, I'm thinking about things like restructuring costs. And most notably, given where we are right now, M&A costs, either integration or transaction costs associated with M&A. 
 So as you start to think of about us now working on the integration of ESI and hopefully in the not-too-distant future, beginning to work on the integration of Spirent, those things will be short-term drains on free cash flow conversion. I think the good news is the ability for us to drive future benefits. We talked about Spirent being ultimately accretive to operating margins, it's ultimately going to drive higher free cash flows going forward once we get through these periods of integration. 
Operator: Thank you all for your questions. That will conclude our Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, everyone, for joining us, and we appreciate the opportunity to speak with you today. We'll turn it back to Sierra just to wrap up and close the call. 
Operator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2024 Q1  (2024-02-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Joel, and I'll be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 20, 2024 at 1:30 PM Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's first quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2024. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under the Financial Information and Quarterly Reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them and encourage you to review our recent SEC filings for a more complete view of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences, hosted by Susquehanna and Morgan Stanley. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My comments will focus on three key headlines: First, Keysight delivered revenue of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $1.63, both of which exceeded the high-end of our guidance. Given the current market conditions, these results reflect the Keysight team's strong execution and resilience of our financial model. Second, orders were $1.2 billion as the demand environment remains constrained. As certain markets continue to normalize from post-pandemic spending levels, our aerospace, defense and government, and network and data center businesses grew, highlighting the benefit of our diverse end-market exposure. Customer engagement and collaborations on next-generation themes remained strong. The adoption of new use cases such as AI is driving new activity and investment across the ecosystem. However, we're not factoring in a strong recovery this fiscal year. Our base-case scenario is for a modest first-half to second-half improvement in orders and revenue. Third, Keysight continues to be well-positioned for outperformance into a market recovery. We are investing to enhance our market leadership and expand our broad portfolio of leading solutions. We are also pleased to have completed the acquisition of ESI ahead of schedule and extend a warm welcome to the team. Along with our existing EDA business, the addition of ESI further expands our software solutions for simulation and emulation, a market with favorable growth attributes as the virtualization of design and prototyping increases. Now, let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's first quarter performance. Market conditions were largely unchanged from the prior quarter. Across our end markets, investment in R&D remained steady, while manufacturing and overall economic activity in Asia continued to moderate. First quarter orders were $1.2 billion, revenue $1.3 billion, and earnings per share of $1.63 were above our guidance, and we generated strong cash flow. Gross margins across the business was strong, and including ESI, we achieved a record 67%, demonstrating the differentiation of our solutions. Operating margin was 28%, reflecting expense discipline and cost actions that we have taken over the past quarter and last year. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined relative to a strong compare last year, which was driven by robust backlog conversion. Quarter one gross margin was a record 68%, reflecting a greater mix of software and higher-value solutions. Orders were in line with expectations with strength in aerospace, defense and government, and the wireline business, while wireless continues to normalize. Aerospace, defense and government revenue declined while orders grew year-over-year. Spending levels remain elevated, as governments around the world prioritize investments in defense modernization, space and satellite applications. We are scaling our threat emulation offerings to a broader set of customers for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications in the US and Europe, resulting in key wins at large primes. Our space and satellite solutions drove businesses this quarter for new space modules and low Earth orbit applications. Leveraging our protocol and digital twin capabilities, we've partnered with Lockheed Martin and a broad set of technology leaders to successfully demonstrate a secure 5G and data link network that integrates land, air and space operations. In commercial communications, customer spending remains cautious. While we're not seeing a market recovery yet, industry inventories are slowly returning to normalized levels. For example, smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 grew meaningfully for the first time since mid-2021. In our wireless business, customer engagements remain high, with ongoing R&D activity in advanced technologies. This results in software and service upgrades that contributed to higher gross margins in the quarter. 5G standards continue to progress and are driving a wide range of new use cases and features for ongoing network deployment. New band combinations are expected to be added to the 3GPP standard this year, driving certification needs. This quarter, we hosted Global Certification Forum that brought together industry leaders across a broad array of sectors to collaborate on certification requirements for network and device interoperability and performance. Next week at Mobile World Congress, we will be demonstrating over a dozen solutions for 5G, Open RAN, satellite connectivity, AI and early 6G capabilities, many of which will be showcased in partnership with industry-leading customers. Moving to our wireline business, we saw order growth for our data center solutions. Orders for 400 gig and 800 gig solutions, both in R&D and manufacturing, grew double-digits. We also achieved a key milestone in partnership with Marvell by enabling test and verification of their new ultra-high-speed networking chip designed for next-generation AI-driven cloud applications. The adoption of AI is clearly lifting activity across the entire data center ecosystem. As the industry deploys AI infrastructure at scale, we expect the demand for high-speed networking and computing capabilities to grow. Turning to the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, revenue was down, reflecting ongoing normalization from outsized demand in the prior year. Customer spending remains cautious as market conditions, particularly in manufacturing, and regionally in China were weaker. Underneath the macro headlines, we see pockets of growth where customers are leaning in and investing to address new use cases and emerging technologies across multiple end markets. In semiconductor, the market environment is mixed. Despite the improved industry outlook for overall fab investments, foundry customers continued to push out large projects due to delays in construction and production timelines. At the same time, we saw strong demand for Keysight's proprietary interferometer system, driven by industry progression in EUV technology. Next-generation performance requirements for new AI-driven data center and ADAS use cases are also driving investments. And we saw some improvement this quarter in memory-related demand as well as mature process capacity in China. In automotive, the funnel of EV opportunities continues to be strong. Competition amongst OEMs, upcoming regulatory requirements and support from government subsidies are incentivizing investments in R&D for new battery technology and charging infrastructure. During the quarter, we secured a key win that marks the expansion of our European battery test footprint into France. As we have noted before, EV funnel is healthy, but the timing and the size of these system-level and longer-dated engagements are expected to vary from quarter to quarter. In general electronics, market conditions were unchanged from last quarter. Ongoing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh on the consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We saw steady demand for our solutions in digital health, industrial automation and advanced research. This quarter, we secured key wins in digital health applications for medical imaging and scanning as well as test automation. Consistent with our software-centric solutions strategy, the value that our customers derive from software and service offerings is enabling business resilience in the current market conditions. Software and services orders and revenue continued to outperform the broader business this quarter and were greater than 35% of total Keysight even excluding ESI. ESI further enhances our design engineering software portfolio and expands our addressable market in automotive, avionics, smart manufacturing, and human workflows. We were pleased to complete the acquisition ahead of schedule, and ESI's results were also ahead of expectations for the quarter. In summary, our market leadership and the strength of our solutions portfolio gives us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the multiple waves of technology innovations and long-term secular growth trends of our markets. Our team's relentless customer focus and sustained customer collaborations also position us well for long-term value creation. In addition, the strength of our financial model continues to generate healthy margins and cash flow. With that, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. First quarter revenue of $1.259 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9%, or 14% on a core basis. Orders of $1.220 billion declined 6%, or 12% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 67%, an increase of 200 basis points year-over-year. Excluding ESI, gross margin was a near-record 66% on lower revenue, supported by a solid mix of software and higher-value solutions. In addition, software was 22% of revenue, while recurring revenue from both software and services grew 10%. Operating expenses of $491 million were flat year-over-year even with the addition of ESI, demonstrating the flexibility of our cost structure and the cost actions that we have taken. Q1 operating margin was 28%, or 27% excluding ESI. These results demonstrate the financial flexibility and resilience of our business. We are outperforming the financial model that we put in place over a decade ago, which calls for only a 300 basis point to 400 basis point year-over-year decline in operating margin when revenue declines 10%. Turning to earnings. We achieved $286 million of net income and delivered earnings of $1.63 per share, of which ESI contributed $0.09. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 176 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $839 million, down 11%, or 12% on a core basis. Commercial communications revenue of $544 million declined 14%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $295 million was down 5%. Altogether, CSG delivered a record gross margin of 68%, and operating margin of 27%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 5% or 19% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which reflects the purchase of ESI within the quarter, generating cash flow from operations of $328 million and free cash flow of $281 million. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 625,000 shares at an average price per share of approximately $149 for a total consideration of $93 million. Now, turning to our outlook. Given Q1 core orders of $1.14 billion and the typical sequential decline in ESI orders and revenue from Q1 to Q2, we expect second quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.190 billion to $1.210 billion, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.34 to $1.40 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 175 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $25 million in ESI revenue and a few cents of earnings dilution from ESI. As we look to the second half of the year and our six-month order funnel, we aren't assuming a strong revenue recovery in Keysight's fiscal second half, which ends in October. Our base-case scenario is that revenue is relatively flat from Q2 to Q3 and sequentially up mid-single-digits Q3 to Q4, in line with typical historical seasonality. That said, we do expect second-half orders to exceed first-half orders, which will be supportive of revenue growth in 2025. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure and discipline, track record of execution and diverse end markets, give us confidence in our ability to outperform even in the current market conditions, while at the same time, investing to capitalize on the best growth opportunities as markets recover. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Neil. Joel, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe if I can start with the first one, just on the sort of what you're implying in terms of the recovery for the back half. I mean, just looking at the 2Q guide, to me, it implies that the organically the business is -- or the core business is down a bit and there is some ESI revenue sequentially declining as well. But if the core business is down sequentially, what's driving the expectation for a recovery starting in 3Q and 4Q? I know you said you're not baking in a recovery in relation to the macros, so is there something more customer-specific or end-market-specific that you're seeing that's driving that expectation? Then, I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. Hi, Samik. I would just say that, as we stated in our prepared remarks, right now, we are -- our base case does not include a meaningful second-half recovery. We're really more looking at seasonal changes as you move throughout the fiscal year, so flattish Q2 to Q3, and then a typical seasonal uptick into Q4, which is typically our stronger quarter of the year. In aggregate, we do expect orders and revenue in the second half to be modestly above the first half, but we're not baking in a recovery at this point.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. I guess -- sorry, Satish, just to clarify, I was more looking at what's the driver there? I mean, when you call it seasonal, it's been below seasonal for a bit. So, is it something more specific to the end markets? And I'll ask my follow-up at same time, if you don't mind.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Sure.
Samik Chatterjee: If you can just shed a bit more light on the order trends in relation to EISG? I know you said, largely unchanged spending, but what are you seeing in the different verticals when it comes to autos versus broader industrial because we've seen a lot of weaker macro data points on that front? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. Thank you, Samik. I would say, at the highest level, the customer engagements that we have are remaining strong. And while there are signs of optimism from customers as we enter the new calendar year, we have not yet seen a progression through our pipeline. And as we said in our -- in my prepared remarks, the market conditions remain largely unchanged from a quarter ago. The aerospace, defense strength that we saw last year continues on. And what we have seen incrementally is the wireline business has actually grown for the first time this quarter, and that was a function of some of the AI-related end-market inflections that are occurring. If I take a regional cut at this, I would say, our largest region, Americas, grew for the first time in four quarters, and this is driven by again the strength in aerospace, defense and the wireline business. But Asia continues to remain weak, especially which is impacting the EISG business and some of the wireless business in that region as it continues to normalize from the peak spending levels. Again to put your question in perspective, CSG entered that normalization phase early and EISG was offset by a few quarters. And so that's what's currently playing out. So, given this backdrop, we think it's prudent to think of a base-case assumption where orders and revenue would be up modestly first half to second half. But should there be a broad and stronger recovery sooner, and there may be some signs out there around SIA index where things are picking up, some of the inventory digestion that's happening, capacity utilization, fabs, but should that occur, we will be in a good position to capitalize on that and recover quicker.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Satish, you mentioned I believe double-digit growth in orders to support data center builds for products like high-speed wireline, which you attributed to AI. Can you give us a better sense of how much of either revenue or orders may be directly or indirectly benefiting from AI at this stage, and how you see that progressing?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, that's a really good question. It's still an emerging opportunity for us, but what is significant this quarter is, we started to see the wireline core parts of our business inflect. And if you recall in the past earnings calls, I've talked about the traffic patterns caused by generative AI really impacting the whole network architecture, compute to networking and switching and silicon, and therefore, we knew that demand was coming up. And so, what we noticed this quarter is our wireline business started to inflect, driven by 400-gig and 800-gig transceiver business in manufacturing as that starts to scale, increased focus on terabit research, we announced a collaboration with Marvell in advanced technologies as well there. So that's the business of today. But as we start to think about the broader landscape here, I would say the memory technologies with HBM is starting to gain interest in our customers, different processor architectures, increased silicon activity enabled by AI. And then, for us, it's very exciting because there is a lot of tools that we can deploy our IP because we have the total stack to help engineers train the AI ML models better. And so, you will see, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA on this front as well. And there's new interface standards. And you know our business is driven by standardization process. So, new interface standards are good for our CXL PCIe Gen-7 and the Ultra Ethernet Consortium are playing into it. Silicon photonics in quantum, while they are sort of enabling technologies, are other areas where we've had investment, where we're now able to address new opportunities. Now a lot of that is not yet baked into our forecast, but we're continuing to action these things through the investments we're making.
Mark Delaney: Yeah. That's a helpful color. My second question was on margins. The company has a target for its EBIT margin to reach 31% to 32% by fiscal '26. Maybe you can help us better understand what kind of revenue would be needed for the company to reach that kind of margin. And I think you have a 5% to 7% revenue CAGR target. I mean, should we be thinking about a couple of years of at least the high-end, if not, higher revenue relative to that targeted order to reach your margin objective? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. It might be a little too premature to talk about the outer years, but here's how we're thinking about it. We've had -- obviously, this is the second year we're entering in where orders are declining. And every time that's happened, we would expect a bounce back in the outer years to be stronger. So that's still to be proven out. And you know the sort of earnings leverage that we get when we are able to grow our business above our models. So, profitability, I'm pretty encouraged by the strong gross margins we're maintaining even on declining top-line right now, that's a function of the software and services content, and just the discipline which we run our business. And so, I feel like getting our business back to growth is the principal driver. And given all the trends that we see across wireless, wireline, the long-term trends we see in next-gen silicon and aerospace, defense and in semi, we believe that we can get back to this growth model that we put out at Investor Day.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. And apologies for the background noise. Maybe just a couple of questions for me. Maybe first, and just in terms of -- clearly, you guys were a little bit more cautious entering into the year. You had guided at the full year. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of versus the environment as you saw 90 days ago, how have your expectations changed? And maybe just on the second question, just in terms of ESI and the earlier closure that we had, just any changes that you can make or able to make to that business kind of earlier than you expected? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think as far as the ESI question goes, I think we're quite positive, incrementally positive about the opportunities that we have to grow our -- grow the ESI business in Keysight's environment. We've long studied the system simulation/emulation marketplace. And so, having all of the capabilities is definitely a huge advantage. And for us, bringing an asset that was sort of locked-in in an European environment and exposing it with our go-to-market channel and taking that into our customer base remains an opportunity to drive growth above what they've been able to do. But incrementally I'm pretty bullish about the technology and the depth of simulation capabilities they bring. They also have a hybrid AI capability that is pretty unique and differentiated that we'll look to fully leverage across the company as we go, and we're also positive about the strong start in the first quarter for ESI. And I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the pipeline that he sees and how he sees that progressing.
Mark Wallace: Yeah. Thanks, Satish. Well, Meta, the pipeline that we see today really supports our base scenario that second-half orders and revenue will be modestly higher than the first half, and this is seen through some improvement in our six-month funnel that Neil mentioned in his prepared statements and we've called out in various other earnings calls as well. The improvement comes in the form of some funnel intake up modestly indicating that we have some green shoots and pockets of demand that are showing up. And the other area is in the funnel velocity, or in other words, how long it takes for opportunities to move through the funnel as some customers are beginning to move a bit more quickly. So, 90 days later, those are the big changes. The short-term funnel is about the same at the beginning of Q1, which still remains constrained, but we are seeing some positive pipeline dynamics as we look out six months.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I guess it sounds like from much of the demand end-market commentary that things are very similar in a demand sense from where they were three months ago. But I guess my question is, is there any place in the business where you see demand continuing to deteriorate on the leading edge? Because orders were down, it seems like on an organic basis, about mid-teens versus Q4, which is a bit sharper than seasonality, and the book-to-bill did step back below 1 after being above 1 last quarter. So, are there any places in the business where things are getting worse? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. I mean I think areas of relative weakness, Satish talked about Asia and China specifically continues to be challenging. I think manufacturing continues to be challenging. And I think we see our wireless customers that are still working through some other issues. On the positive side, wireline, driven by AI is clearly a strength point. Mark, do you want to add?
Mark Wallace: Yeah. I would just add to that, we have said that the weakness is in China for EISG businesses. As we said, if you look at China, we saw customer engagements continue. I was there in December. Our historic exposure to China has been high-teens of revenue. It was a little lower than that in Q1, and it was because of the continued headwinds incrementally worse in semi and manufacturing. But we did see sequential order growth from Q1 to Q -- from Q4 to Q1 driven by this demand that we talked about earlier with growth in 400 gig and 800 gig, R&D for the data center upgrades, some demand for 5G private networks. And as a global company, we're also exposed to some of the offshoring, that has been going on and continues as some of the multinational companies move offshore. And the last thing I'll say is, thinking back over the last several quarters, we vastly de-risked China from a trade perspective. It was it was meaningless in Q1, additions to the RPL have had a [variable] (ph) impact. We continue to monitor the situation very closely. So that's where we've seen some of the headwinds, but even there I've seen some positive indicators in China as well.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. Appreciate that. And then, for my follow-up, I wanted to ask around backlog. Neil, I think you said $2.3 billion again, which is more than six months of coverage at this quarterly revenue run rate. But you guys are kind of saying that you don't expect revenue to get better into the back half of the year. So, on this excess backlog, when does the company think it could start coming through in revenue? And is it because these big chip customers are pushing out their CapEx plans, or is it just because of the company has moved more towards a solutions-based model? Any help with that would be great. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. So, you're correct. The number is $2.3 billion. And I would start by saying that we now stated a couple of quarters ago that we believe we've worked through the excess backlog. And so -- and we did that last year when revenue outpaced orders by the tune of $275 million or something like that was when we worked through that excess backlog. I think as we look currently, we're managing a couple of things. Obviously, by design, our recurring revenue businesses, software and services are holding up. You see that in an increasing deferred revenue balance. But in addition to this, we're also managing this dynamic between where our -- we've seen a pretty significant increase in these longer-dated orders, which if you remember correctly, historically been about 2% of our incoming order rate and we really didn't talk about it as a result of that. Last year, they were more like 8% of the incoming order rate. They were 8% again here in Q1. And as Mark talked about, we have a robust funnel of longer-dated opportunities as we look out over the course of the next six months. And so, that's the dynamic that we're starting to see. We are starting to see those longer-dated orders show up in revenue. We saw that beginning in Q1. And by Q4, we expect revenue from those longer-dated programs to be about 8% of that Q4 revenue.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Hi, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: I think to get to the -- a question on operating margins. I think to get to the midpoint of guidance, they're down 600 basis points, 700 basis points year-over-year. And my question is, is that what you would expect in your model? Or is there something specifically impacting margins in Q2?
Neil Dougherty: No. I think that's basically -- we are performing in line with the model, right? So, if you take a look at what's happening, obviously, you see the significant sequential decline in ESI, which is as expected. But if you adjust for that, you're seeing a mid-teens kind of decline in the core business, right, from a revenue perspective. And we've talked about the downside model that contemplates 300 basis points to 400 basis points of operating margin decline when revenues are down 10%. Obviously, we're down significantly more than that, but we're continuing to perform basically in line with that model. We've taken significant actions. Our cost actions started last year and enabled us to deliver record operating margins on flat revenue in an inflationary environment. And then, this quarter, as it started to begin to appear that the recovery was pushing out, we've taken incremental actions that are going to benefit us. We now expect that total OpEx for the company will be down low-single digits on a year-over-year basis prior to the addition of ESI. And all of that reduction is going to show up in the SG&A line items as we like to strike a balance between investment and financial performance. We're going to maintain our investments in R&D. We would expect R&D to be flat. But again, total OpEx down about 3%, driven by actions we've taken to control SG&A.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just a quick one on -- how is auto demand holding up in this environment, EV/AV charging?
Mark Wallace: Yeah, Adam, in the quarter, we saw continued R&D spend for battery and charging infrastructure. We expect that to continue. Manufacturing spend, supply chain spend was down. You've seen unit volumes drop for both conventional and EV demand. So that's where we see that. But e-mobility, which is EV and autonomous, as Neil mentioned, as I mentioned, the funnel remains strong, very robust, as we look at Q2 into FY '24. A lot of this is a long-dated program spend around battery test charging infrastructure. Some of these products -- programs are fluid. So many of them are based on some government subsidies that you may have read have been delayed in Europe and so forth. But we're tied into all of those. And as we look forward, this space continues to be one that's going to be driving growth for us for a long time.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And also, some of the capabilities that we have developed around electrification are finding new applications in aerospace and defense and other end-markets that are also going to be impacted by the similar trends. And so, we're quite pleased by the leverage and synergies we'll see as we move forward.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. I wanted to ask one on the wireless business. Can you just kind of run through some of the technologies and give us a sense how they might be influencing the business? Just curious, you mentioned the 5GPP standards. What's on the come there? Anything new with millimeter wave, or 6G, or O-RAN? If you could just kind of give us a little state of the union on those? And then, I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, we'll do. Tim, I think at the highest level, what we've seen so far is that Release 15 and 16 deployments that have occurred largely in the United States and in China and now in India. So, we expected, and we've talked about this to the industry capital, would peak some point in '22-'23. So roughly we got that timing right. But if you think about the business model that we established for commercial comms and for our wireless business, it was always about more vector to service the R&D customers. So, while even in this environment, the volumes are down especially the manufacturing production-related volumes with the RAN markets down. So, we're starting to see that effect and the businesses normalizing. But what we're continuing to see is customers engage with us in buying upgrades for their release library. So going from 15, 16 to 17 as an example, which is much more evolutionary nature. But as we think about the future now, the roadmap is very clear. It's sort of a roadmap for the next five years where the industry is working on Release 18, Release 19 followed by 20, which would include some early study items on 6G as an example. But some of the same ideas that we had for growth, which are built around vertical industry expansions with AI ML, new device form factors such as the Vision Pro that's just launched that's capturing a lot of imagination on what augmented reality can mean in the future. And just sort of the integration I should say of satellite communications and terrestrial networks is opening up new threads of innovation and exposing us to more customers that want our capability. So all-in-all, in balance, I look at the capabilities we have, our market leadership position that we've established in 5G, and I feel confident that post-normalization of this demand that we can return the business to growth even prior to 6G. But that's yet to play out, but that's our best thinking at this point.
Tim Long: Okay, great. And then I just wanted to follow up on the optical side. It sounds like 400 gig, 800 gig are pretty strong. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on R&D for the cycle beyond that? And also, curious about what's going on the software side Ixia and some of the other software businesses related to optical wireline. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think, what we're seeing is obviously, the first instantiation with every technology like this, where 100 gig times 400 gig times eight sort of topologies are currently being -- are being deployed. And so, we're obviously, engaged with that and we're starting to benefit from that. But the roadmap is clear, right, then it's going to get to 200 times four, because the scaling continues and leading to even higher-speed research in 1.6 terabits and beyond. So that's on the wireline side. The Ixia business or what was Ixia business, we -- it's integrated into our wireline business and it's been remarkably stable for us in the commercial communications market because of the higher services and software content associated with that business. And it's also a business that doesn't really trend up that significantly during upcycles. So, it's been a very steady business for us. And one we're -- now we're able to take out some of the traffic generation capabilities and adapt it to go address some of the emerging AI use cases. So, we're quite pleased by the assets we have in the company and by our ability to go and solve customers' emerging challenges even beyond the traditional segments we serve.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I have two as well. Neil, I wanted to go back to your prior comments on kind of backlog. I know last quarter -- last couple of quarters, you've talked about these longer-dated backlog or order dynamics, and I think even last quarter you quantified it at like $400 million. Can you give us an update how much of your backlog today is kind of these longer-dated deals? And could we consider them as kind of large lumpy deals that possibly rev rec wise show up late this year into more so '25? Or how do we just think about that?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. From a backlog perspective, we're in the $400 million to $500 million range of our backlog as these long-dated deals. You are correct that they tend to be larger lumpier deals in aerospace, defense, auto, and even in the semi space. And as I said on the previous question about this, we've actually started to see them now, because we started to see the ramp in a little bit in Q1 of last year, but then really in earnest in Q2 of last year on the order line, and some of those things are starting to flow through to revenue now. Now, we're not at 8% yet from a revenue perspective. We expect to be there by the end of the year. But just as you suggested, it is lumpy, right? So, you could end up in a situation where there is relatively lower either order or revenue activity from these types of transactions and some other quarter you might have double activity just given the nature of the business.
Aaron Rakers: Yeah, that's helpful, Neil. And then, as a second question, I wanted to go back to the AI networking discussion. Clearly, a lot of focus here, but a lot of focus on the wireline side is this 400-gig, 800-gig transition towards Ethernet versus InfiniBand. I'm curious to Keysight's positioning. Is there a disproportionate position around Ethernet and the deployment cycle of back-end AI networks based on Ethernet versus InfiniBand? Or is it maybe not such that we should delineate between the two for the company?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think for us, we don't try to pick winners. In some ways, innovation is best served when you have multiple competing technologies approach the same challenge. But fundamentally, data is growing. The pattern of data through these networks are altering and changing, which requires the communication systems to adapt. And I think all the way from memory to network, NIC cards, to compute architectures are getting more heterogeneous if you will. So, more standards. I talked about CXL, the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, PCIe Gen-7, et cetera. So, all of that really creates a real good bed of technologies for us to service through our platforms. And often, it's the same underlying platform -- I missed out USB 4.0, but often it's the same sort of underlying platforms that we have from all the way from oscilloscopes, to our BERTs, to our network traffic emulators from our Ixia acquisition. So, we tend to go approach these things and then add in more software capabilities as we move forward. We're actually quite pleased with the performance and the resilience of our software business even through these times. And software and services represents roughly now 40% of the total order/revenue in the most recent quarter, and we'll continue to keep growing the value of the company. Our ARR was also up double digits this quarter.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.
Matt Niknam: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe unpacking the guide for fiscal 2Q, are you anticipating modest sequential pressure across the board? Or are there any pockets in the business where you may be anticipating or seeing some level of sequential improvements in the fiscal second quarter? And then maybe just secondly, in terms of -- we talked a lot about wireline. I'm just wondering on the wireless side, expectations for that business this year, simply given maybe some green shoots we're reading about, and also the fact that seem to be a business that maybe started seeing the downturn a little bit sooner. So, I'm just wondering if there's any additional color you can share in terms of expectations for the year. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I'll take the second part, then I'll have Mark sort of walk through his thinking on the pipeline, which really no impact -- I mean, which really flow into our guide, if you will. On the wireless side, I think we're continuing to expect stability and moderation as it comes off of strong peak demand years in '21 and '22. So that normalization phase continues to play out over the next couple of quarters, and that's sort of our base case thinking on wireless. All of the R&D activity that I described continues on, but we're still waiting for any inflection in component spend which we're not seeing at this point. So that's sort of our expectations on wireless. And I'll just have Mark make some comments on the pipeline.
Mark Wallace: Yeah. And Matt, I think it's more of the same what we've been speaking about in terms of the markets that are driving growth. I expect aerospace, defense to continue to be an area of driving growth for us, not only in the US but in Europe and other countries that are faced with the geopolitical situation that exists today. We are operating under continuing resolution in the US, which we're expecting that budget to be signed this quarter, which is favorable for us in terms of the RDT and E-Line items that are getting bipartisan support to progress through this election year. So that seems to be an area for us. And then, the defense modernization, as we've already touched around, there is multiple areas of innovation that involve long-term, short-term programs with the prime contractors, again around MSO space crossing over into commercial sector. So there's a lot of vectors within what we would traditionally call aerospace and defense. Wireline as we just spent a lot of time talking about continues to provide opportunities for us to grow. And then I think as we've mentioned, the automotive funnel, which is quite robust, has programs that are crossing into the next several three quarters and we are actively engaged with all of those. So, I expect that to be a driver of growth for us as well. And we'll watch it and take it a quarter at a time with the headwinds that we're currently experiencing on manufacturing and on semiconductors. But as we mentioned, we saw some growth around memory. That's an early indicator that typically goes first. We expect that to continue to be an area of strength. And of course, we're watching very closely the status of these additional fabs that are in the process of being built out in various places around the world.
Matt Niknam: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. You may proceed.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. First one is for Neil. Just want to better understand the organic change in your revenue. Assuming $60 million from ESI in the January quarter and then about $25 million in the April quarter, the decline in organic revenue on a sequential basis is only 2%. Is that correct?
Neil Dougherty: It was -- ESI was $67 million, $68 million in Q1 a little higher, and so I think the revenue decline Q1 to Q2 in the core is still rounds to 1%. It's just a tick over 1%.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. So perhaps maybe the expectation was for a different contribution from ESI and maybe a little bit better than expected trend with the organic. But the ESI is making some compares difficult. Would you agree?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. I mean, yes. First of all, ESI was great in Q1. There's significantly 10% or more above our expectation going into the quarter. They saw strong renewal activity as expected with some good upsizing of transactions and other things that drove that revenue nicely. The sequential decline in ESI is totally as expected that we talked about it last quarter, that 40% to 45% of their orders and revenue are falling because their renewal schedules fall on Keysight's first quarter. But it does make the compares a bit more challenging when looking at the combined entity.
Mehdi Hosseini: Right. Okay. Don't want to come across [indiscernible], but I think these compares get a little bit murky looking into April versus January. Looking into July and October, obviously, your comments suggest maybe April, July will be the bottom and then a modest recovery in October. So the question for Satish is what do you think the driver behind that modest rebound would be? And why should we assume acceleration in that rebound into FY '25? The 5G is behind us, but what are some of the other key drivers that would give you confidence that the modest rebound should follow by acceleration unless you tell me it's just going to be a modest improvement into FY '25?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. The profile -- the timing and the profile of the recovery, Mehdi, as you can appreciate, is hard to really quantify or analytically quantify for you at this point. But let me give you some subjective color on what we're seeing. I think we're seeing continued strength in aerospace, defense. Mark touched upon that. The trends are on defense modernization. The new emulation solutions are continuing to proliferate through that ecosystem. And given the sort of national security emphasis that's playing out, we think that's on a sure track. We also have seen the 5G platform that we have get into some of the more defense-related applications and we announced a collaboration as an example with Lockheed Martin. So, we look at that and we look at the pipeline of opportunities that Mark referenced and feel good about the aerospace and defense. And typically, as you would expect, our aerospace, defense has the strongest quarter in quarter four. So that's one part of the equation. The other thing is what we're hearing from some of our semiconductor customers as the fab companies coming out and laying out their plans for '25 is they're all planning for a pretty strong '25 capital environment around next-generation 2-nanometer technology, and some of the new investments around power semiconductor and silicon photonics and other areas. And so, we would expect some uptick there in our semi business, which has been depressed by the time we roll out in Q4 and entering into Q1. So, it's hard to really time it on a quarterly basis, but that's sort of the horizon that we would expect. We would expect the wireline business to largely continue to perform well because the drivers on AI continue to remain robust. And then wireless, I'm just factoring in a pretty gradual recovery as we go through the year. So that's sort of our base case. Now, there is this whole macro. What does the macro do? And if the global PMI improves quicker, then maybe there's some upside in our general electronics business. But we're at this point just assuming that there isn't this big broad recovery this year or in this fiscal year anyway. We would assume that second half is just modestly bigger in business than the first half. But again, if we go back and look at the situation as we take it a step back, last year was the first year where orders declined double digits. We were still able to use our backlog to deliver revenue -- a stronger revenue -- I mean at least an upside revenue and strong profitability. So now we're coming off of that, this will be the second year when if orders don't rebound, we would expect a strong rebound from our experience historically running this business.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: One of the hallmarks of Keysight has been the ability to continue to invest organically and inorganically through cycles. How do you see R&D spending and also your appetite for additional M&A this year?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. Thank you. I think first and foremost, I would say from an organic -- we're an organic-first company. We believe in taking a long-term view of our markets. And what's changed since we formed Keysight is our organization that is focused on customers. So we're getting strong validation around our investments with our customers. So, partnerships and collaborations are key to how we are able to realize the full value of our organic investment. So, we feel very good about where we are focused on from a portfolio perspective and our ability to drive long-term organic growth. Now, having said that, I laid out at Investor Day four or five areas where we are looking at some expansion opportunities. Some of them we're pursuing organically as well, but we're also looking at our pipeline from an M&A perspective and looking for opportunities where we can create good return on investment for our shareholders. You've seen us be incredibly disciplined as we have pursued these opportunities. We walked away from deals where we thought we couldn't get a good return. And so, you can expect that even as we pursue these opportunities and look at the pipeline, we will stay disciplined as we go through this -- as we go through the evaluation.
Neil Dougherty: And I could add -- just add one additional bit of color on the R&D side. We stayed very disciplined in the period of time in '21 and '22, where revenues were growing at a high level of rate. We underspent our R&D target of 16.5% of revenue that continued into '23. What that enables us to do now in '24 is maintain R&D investments basically flat. As I said in my earlier comments, that'll take R&D up above that 16.5% target on a percent of revenue basis, but it'll allow us to continue our investments to make sure that we're full participants in the eventual upturn.
David Ridley-Lane: Great. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. How are you working on getting the ESI and Keysight sales forces aligned and prioritizing which customers to go after on a joint basis? And am I right in thinking just similar to other software companies, it takes six, nine months to build the pipeline and then another six months to close, so those benefits, we should think of showing up maybe in fiscal '25?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, I think ESI was well on track of transforming the business to growth. And our first priority is to continue to support their base plan. And that's baked into '24. But in a targeted way, Mark and his team have already started to engage to take those capabilities and apply them to our aerospace and defense customer base in the U.S. as a first order of priority. But as I've gotten to know that portfolio, what gives me excitement is their core technologies around hybrid AI, which I think could find a broader leverage into other Keysight applications to accelerate our pursuits. But that's with time. Our number one priority is to stabilize, integrate, and basically keep their base plan on track. And I think they're off to a good start.
David Ridley-Lane: All right. Thank you very much.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. You may proceed.
Rob Mason: Yes, thank you. Neil, I wanted to go back to the conversation you pointed out the operating model performing as expected on the downside operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Is there anything that you'd call out sequentially impacting operating margins? It just looks like the sequential deleverage is a little high, if I'm doing my math correctly, higher.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, it's a good question. And there are a few things. So, first of all, we had a very favorable mix within the quarter in Q1, not just because ESI was in at $67 million or $68 million of revenue on software, but even within the Keysight classic portion of the business, we were north of 66%, so very favorable in the core as well. We do not expect to be mixed to be as favorable next quarter as it was or frankly -- probably for the rest of the year, mix is unlikely to be as favorable as it was in the first quarter. And the other thing would be from an OpEx perspective, we do expect Q2 OpEx to be seasonally higher, that is typical. And the single biggest factor to that is PTO usage. PTO usage is the lowest in the second quarter of our fiscal year, and that's enough to drive a measurable increase in OpEx as we move from Q1 to Q2.
Satish Dhanasekaran: It might also be worth highlighting our confidence in both the operating cash flow performance and also the free cash flow conversion, we had 98% of net operating profit this quarter. So, we feel good about the cash flow generation capabilities as we navigate this near-term downturn in our markets.
Rob Mason: Yeah, certainly. Just as a second question. There's -- during the quarter, we saw more, I guess, some of your EDA and simulation participants in the market converging. I know Keysight has some strategic partnerships with some of the players involved there. I'm just curious how you think consolidation around those areas affects your opportunity? And maybe you could speak to any of the test layers that would be more impacted or not? And really just kind of getting at how do you define Keysight's moat in this backdrop where you're seeing some of the simulation converge?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think when we think about the markets, we're approaching it, obviously, from tests to emulation to simulation, and we're connecting the workflow there. In many ways, we collaborate with all of the players that have been on record, and we have a relationship with them so that we can offer a good workflow experience for customers. And this has long been a market where there's been good interplay between the tools because just like Keysight is an engineering company, we are also a customer of a number of these tools, and it's hard to standardize on the tool or the other because each of them have different focus areas and different strategies. So, when we piece it together, we don't view this as necessarily a big impact to our plans. We, in fact, are continuing to progress our system simulation, emulation strategy and SAM expansion. And with ESI in the company, we have more capabilities to drive that strategy moving forward.
Rob Mason: Very good. That's helpful. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in queue. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Jason for concluding remarks.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Joel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to talking to you later this quarter and wish you a good day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Wells Fargo and UBS. And now I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, Keysight reported solid fourth quarter results and finished the year with record revenue, gross margins and operating margin, in what remains a challenging macro environment. Fourth quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance, as orders came in slightly ahead of expectations. For the full year, revenue grew 2% on a core basis and earnings per share increased 9%, while we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow. Second, our customer engagement on next-generation technology teams remain strong and we continue to action opportunities, across a broad and diverse set of end markets. Despite the mixed demand environment, as end markets normalize from post-COVID supply demand imbalances over the last two years. Third, we're investing both organically and inorganically, to expand our addressable markets and differentiated solutions portfolio, which took other step forward this quarter with the addition of ESI. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth drivers of our business and our ability to address our customers' most challenging and diverse innovation needs. Now let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's fourth quarter and full year performance. We're pleased with our results and execution. Fourth quarter orders were $1.3 billion, and we delivered $1.3 billion in revenue and $1.99 in earnings per share. We also generated $340 million in free cash flow and repurchased $426 million of our shares this quarter. Full year results were strong in a year of normalizing demand. Orders of $5.2 billion were in line with our original expectations of approximately $1.3 billion per quarter this year. We delivered an all-time high of $5.5 billion in revenue and achieved record profitability with gross margins of 66% and operating margins of 30% and $8.33 in earnings per share. Moving to our markets. Overall, the demand dynamics within the quarter, were consistent with our expectations. Aerospace, Defense and Government demand increased, commercial communications was steady and as anticipated, broader manufacturing-related spending in the electronics industrial markets was incrementally softer. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group revenue declined 10%. Aerospace, Defense and Government grew, while Commercial Communication markets are rebalancing off of last year's record highs. On a sequential basis, orders grew across both markets. In Aerospace, Defense and Government, revenue grew 4% to an all-time high, we saw healthy order demand from the US and European primes, as well as direct government customers, driven by investments in Defense modernization, space and satellite applications. Keysight's Leading Threat Emulation solutions capabilities drove order growth in the US, including a large US Department of Defense win for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. We also saw demand from European primes for our Radar and phased array antenna solutions to support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. The breadth and the depth of our solutions portfolio enable new customer engagements and business in satellite communications 5G and 6G and advanced quantum research, including a large order from a premier research institute contributing to the record quarter. In Commercial Communications, revenue declined 17%, reflecting ongoing customer spending constraints, as inventories in their markets normalize. Sequentially, we saw stability in wireless orders and incremental strength in demand for network and data center applications. Demand for our wireline solutions was driven by AI ML and data center expansion, as hyperscalers build infrastructure to handle increasing network and compute workloads. We expect this trend to continue into the next year and beyond. Enterprise customer business was stable with ongoing investments in network monitoring, driven by increasing data traffic and cybersecurity compliance needs. In Wireless, the progression of standards is driving steady R&D investments in new capabilities and devices, as well as Open RAN and Release 17 features. Our R&D engagements with customers continue to expand. This quarter, we enable MediaTek to validate non-terrestrial network connectivity. In addition, Keysight was awarded two key UK government grants in partnership with universities and leading telecom operators to support Open RAN design, testing and deployment in Europe. Turning to Electronic Industrial Solutions Group. As expected, Q4 orders and revenue were both down compared to record levels of last year. It is important to note that the EISG has shown significantly about long-term expectations with revenue increasing by 30% in 2021, 14% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023. This growth was driven by both our Differentiated Solutions portfolio and an outsized demand from post-COVID recovery and supply constraints. In the second half of this year, we began to see a normalization from these size as well as ongoing cautious customer spending. In semiconductor, capital spending for wafer capacity contracted in the quarter, as foundry customers pushed out their new fab investment time lines. We continue to see strong customer engagement for Keysight's proprietary interferometer systems and differentiated R&D solutions for silicon photonics and power semiconductors, reflecting the industry's medium to long-term recovery and growth expectations. In automotive, customer investment in R&D for battery and charging infrastructure continues and is being fueled by increasing competition, regional legislative deadlines and government funding, particularly in Europe and Asia. The funnel of EV opportunities remain strong, while the timing and size of these systems engagements are expected to vary from a quarter-to-quarter. In General Electronics, we saw steady demand for our solutions in advanced research, industrial automation and digital health. However, and more broadly, manufacturing capacity normalization and cautious spending continued to weigh in on consumer electronics and manufacturing portions of the market. We're watching Global PMI and other macroeconomic indicators to gauge the timing of the market recovery. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services revenue growth this year continue to outpace Keysight overall. The recurring portion of software and services grew 9% this year, driving total annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.3 billion or 23% of total revenue, an increase of 200 basis points, year-over-year. In early November, ahead of schedule, we announced our acquisition of a controlling block of shares of ESI Group. The addition of ESI, further increases our software and annual recurring revenue expands our addressable markets and strengthens our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles. We continue to invest prudently to capitalize on our long-term growth opportunities. In parallel, we remain disciplined and are taking additional targeted cost actions to streamline operations and ensure strong financial performance. In wrapping up my first full year, as the CEO of Keysight, I'd like to thank our employees for their outstanding contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution in these tough market conditions. The strength of Keysight's differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets and the durability of our business model, all position us well for continued market outperformance, as we enter the new fiscal year. With that, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.311 billion was just above the high end of our guidance range and down 9% or 10%, on a core basis. Orders of $1.327 billion declined 16% on both a reported and core basis. Similar to the third quarter, demand in China was muted and accounted for roughly 1/3 of the year-over-year order decline. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 130 basis points, year-over-year and operating expenses of $474 million, resulting in operating margin of 29%. We achieved net income of $352 million and delivered earnings of $1.99 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 177 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $891 million, down 10% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $568 million, declined 17%, while Aerospace, Defense and Government revenue of $323 million was up 4%, driven by increasing defense budgets and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated revenue of $420 million, down 7%, as reported or 8% on a core basis. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 30%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered strong results, despite demand and foreign exchange headwinds. Full year 2023 revenue grew 1% as reported or 2% on a core basis to a record $5.464 billion. Gross margin of 66% expanded 80 basis points. We invested $842 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 90 basis points to 30%. The flexibility of our cost structure and actions that we've taken to further reduce costs, drove FY'23 net income to a record $1.5 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.33, which was up 9%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the fourth quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $378 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.212 billion, representing 22% of revenue and 81% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 3,270, 000 shares, at an average price per share of approximately $130. For a total consideration of $426 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to 4.9 million shares, at an average share price of approximately $143 for a total consideration of $702 million or 58% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook. Looking forward to fiscal year '24, we expect the demand environment in the first half to remain mixed, and we'll be closely watching for signs of recovery in the second half. Going forward, we will report results including ESI, which is expected to be slightly dilutive to earnings on the full year. Given the timing of annual contract renewals, ESI typically recognizes 40% to 45% of their full year revenue in Keysight's fiscal first quarter, with the balance recognized relatively evenly over the remainder of the year. Also, due to GAAP accounting rules, ESI earnings recognition will be proportional to our shareholding, until all shares are acquired. With the normalization of backlog over the past year, our Q1 guidance is based on, one, existing backlog that is scheduled to ship this quarter; two, our view of incoming Q1 orders and three, our ability to turn a portion of those incoming orders into revenue within the quarter. We now expect first quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.235 billion to $1.255 billion and Q1 earnings per share in the range of $1.53 to $1.59 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 176 million shares. This guidance includes approximately $60 million in ESI revenue and an EPS impact of approximately $0.05 from ESI net income. Now I would like to highlight a few modeling items for FY'24. As I just mentioned, we are modeling a significant sequential decrease in ESI revenue in Q2 and over the same period, we expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight revenue. Excluding ESI, FY'24 operating expenses are expected to be flat to slightly down year-over-year, reflecting the structural flexibility of our business model and the cost actions we have initiated. With the addition of ESI, we expect FY'24 R&D investment to be 17% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $150 million and we are modeling a 17% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY'24. In closing, Keysight's flexible cost structure, track record for execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform, even in challenging market conditions. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sarah, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thank you. Maybe first question, you guys talked about kind of an over-performance of EISG or how well that business had done over the last couple of years. Just trying to get a sense of, is there a period, where you think kind of represents, the run rate of that business just as we think of the growth of that business going forward? And then -- maybe just the second question, just on the Communications business. You guys have mentioned kind of seeing stabilization in that business. So I just wanted to kind of clarify that none of the weakness that you are seeing has kind of spread to more of the lab testing that it's largely kind of stayed on the production side. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Meta. Absolutely. The EISG business, as we have said, the long-term market growth rates 4% to 6% and our goal is to beat it. And the business, obviously, has been performing significantly above that for a prolonged period of time. And that's really a function of the differentiated positions, we have, almost unique positions in some -- with some customers across these end markets that they serve. And it's also been a focus for us to continue to diversify the company. And with regard to the Commercial comps business, we saw sequential order improvement between Q4 relative to Q3. And again, that's stability in Wireless, continued stability now for a few quarters in Wireless, especially with 5G. And again, that is a function of the R&D holding up much better, and we're still awaiting a recovery in manufacturing. And then we saw some signs of recovery in our wired part of the ecosystem, again, driven by, what appears to be a sustained push to invest in AI ML/data center infrastructure by the cloud/hyperscalers.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess for my first one, so just to clarify the comments around seasonality that you had, particularly now including the acquisition. I think what you're, I guess, guiding to is a sequential decline into the April quarter and that is the trough in terms of revenues. And when you think about the sort of back half of the year, how do you think about seasonality from 2Q onwards? Should we be thinking about sort of the typical seasonal increases that you see? Just any clarification in terms of, if I put in those comments correctly? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I do think you interpreted the comments correctly. I think as we move from Q1 to Q2, we do expect a low single-digit increase in core Keysight. But ESI, as we mentioned, because of the timing of their contract renewals, recognized as a disproportionate portion of their revenue in Keysight's first quarter, 40% to 45% with the balance 55% to 60%, spread roughly evenly over the subsequent three quarters. So there is a significant drop off on the ESI side of things, just given the timing of those contractual renewals. I think, obviously, we're taking this one quarter at a time, given the normalization that we're seeing in the marketplace. I do think that over time, we expect the seasonality of the Keysight business to return more towards historic norms, than what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a result of the supply chain disruptions, but we'll have to wait and see how that develops as we move forward.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. And just in terms of the -- how to think about margins for this year, just a lot of puts and takes. I know you had some comments earlier about, I think last quarter, it was about sort of a 10% revenue decline is where we should expect 200 to 250 basis points of margin deterioration in the operating margin side, but you now have the acquisition, which is probably a bit diluted, but you also have taken cost actions. So can you just give us an updated framework on how to think about margins for the year, particularly given all the puts and takes? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So we've shared the same essentially, model describing kind of demand normalization here, really since our spin. And that's a model that says, if our revenues are down 10%, that we would expect operating margins to be down 300 to 400 basis points in that scenario. That's obviously pre any acquisition activity. So when you think about layering in ESI, obviously, it's a public company, you can look at their results. At this point, we only own half the shares. It's going to take us a while to get to full ownership. So I think you can layer in ESI in the short run, much as they were -- as they were running as an independent company. And once we get to full ownership, we'll be able to really set our minds on cost reduction within that space, synergy realization.
Samik Chatterjee: Good. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Please proceed.
Robert Mason: Yes, good afternoon. Last quarter, we talked about a surge in some of these longer-dated orders year-to-date. I'm just curious as you wrapped up the year where the total sum of those came in relative to last year? And then do you have any perspective on how those would start to be converted to revenue? Are those 2024 revenue events? Or are we looking more out into 2025?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So first of all, as we said last quarter, they were about 8% of orders to date, and that's where they finished. So Q4 was on par with the first three quarters of the year, and that compared to we're like 2% as a historic run rate. The majority of that revenue will be in '24, although there is a portion, a sizable portion that pushes out into '25.
Robert Mason: And is -- just for clarification, is that likely to show up in the EISG segment or in the CSG segment?
Neil Dougherty: It's a mix. I think earlier in the year, those orders skewed towards EISG, not surprising with the strength in Aerospace, Defense and Government fiscal year-end. In the fourth quarter, they were more skewed towards Aerospace, Defense end market. So it really is a mix.
Robert Mason: Very good. And just as a final question, if I could. Just do you have any sense as to what a reasonable time line should be to come complete the entirety of the ESI acquisition, the squeeze-out process?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. It really depends on what happens during this tender offer process, which again, we expect to complete the tender in the calendar first quarter. I think if we do that, then we'll move immediately and that goes as expected, we'll move immediately to a squeeze out that I think would have us complete mid-year. There are scenarios, where if less than the required number of people get to tender, where it will take us a little bit longer to meet the appropriate thresholds to essentially do the squeeze-out process.
Robert Mason: Very good. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. I want to go back to the prior question on kind of the longer backlog metric. I think last quarter, you talked about that being $200 million. Is that -- I know you said 8% of orders, but is that still that -- roughly that number, which should be on top of the $2.3 billion or so total backlog you came out of exiting this last quarter?
Neil Dougherty: Well, the numbers are included in the backlog, right? And so if you take our order rate for the year about 8%. So you get to somewhere around $400 million of longer-dated backlog, orders with longer-dated backlog that we took within the year. Obviously, some of that -- if we took a 10-month order in Q1, it would have shipped here at the tail end of '23, but you can that view that most of that $400 million is sitting in our backlog, as we enter fiscal '24.
Aaron Rakers: And to be clear, that will, typically, your backlog was a six-month forward number. It sounds like a majority of that would be recognized in the back half of the fiscal year. That's a fair assessment?
Neil Dougherty: I'm just thinking, as we've received those orders all throughout the year. And so again, there is -- there are a couple of large-scale projects that pushed out into '25, where we'll get kind of lump sum revenue recognition. It probably has a back half skew though for the portion that's in '24, I would say there's a back half skew for sure.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. Perfect. And then the real quick follow-up is, could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on Wireline with regard to AI? Just maybe flesh out exactly where you're involved? Because it seems like that is -- clearly, as we move towards possibly Ethernet and 800 gig, it seems like that would be inflecting. I'm just curious to how Keysight's involved in that?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think as we talked about, our Commercial Comms business is diversified with exposure into both Wireless and Wireline parts of the ecosystem. For the Wireline parts of the ecosystem, we're obviously tethered to computing, networking, being the core end markets. And what we're starting to see is some signs to the compute markets are starting to stabilize after a period of inventory digestion that was underway. But equally, there is some incremental spend that's occurring driven by cloud and hyperscalers, who are pretty serious about upgrading that infrastructure. And so that's manifesting itself in manufacturing test for our transceiver test business. It's also manifesting itself in increased spend that we saw this quarter for 800 gig and also terabit Ethernet solutions. And so we're quite pleased with the sequential uptick we've seen. Again, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but I think we're encouraged by the progression that we've seen on the Wireline side.
Aaron Rakers: Thank you, guys.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Please proceed.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you. So orders came in up about 7% sequentially. I think it was the best order quarter number for fiscal '23. And I understand there's seasonality involved, but can you maybe just talk about, where orders have improved versus three to six months ago, versus maybe where you've seen continued softening in orders versus three to six months ago? And then specifically for the AI ML and the data center infrastructure, could you size how big that AI ML related businesses today, whether it's on orders or revenue? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, maybe at the highest level, I would just say, we got a sequential improvement, I would say, in orders from our Aerospace, Defense business, which was strong. Obviously, the year-end is typically what we expect. We saw that for Commercial Communications, sequential growth, stability in Wireless/5G and a sequential uptick in our Wired part of the ecosystem. And what we anticipated also was, we would see some softness in the EISG business, particularly with Asia and China, and we did experience that. Now again, to put it in context, the EISG business is just later in undergoing this demand normalization. And so that was what we had sort of forecasted, and so it behaved as we expected. With regard to the Wireline Ecosystem, I just go back to our long-term growth rate expectations for the Communications business in general and say that we see a business that is diversified, where multiple technology waves are overlapping. And that gives us inherent stability and resilience, and we're pleased by some of the progression we're seeing in the AI ML spend, because we've been working with customers on this for some time now. And we expect that as more of the network traffic is driven by applications that are coming out for AI ML, this will become a bigger part of our business. I'll just maybe hand it off to Mark to make some comments on orders.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, I'll just add a few color comments to what Satish did here. And then it really begins with all of our customers, still remaining very active in their R&D projects. And we see that in our funnel in terms of new funnel intake, which has been very positive. And our ability to convert that remains high, although as we've said for the last several quarters, some of this long-dated backlog and then customers taking a bit more time to make these decisions as have been a factor as well. I'm also seeing stabilization in the indirect businesses, some of the inventories in our distributors normalize, and I'm very pleased with our e-commerce business, which continues to be strongly adopted. We saw about a doubling of business through that -- through that channel. And in total, we continue to add new customers, more than 2,000 during the course of the last year, and about 300 of those came through e-commerce. So there's some positive elements of what we've seen in the fourth quarter.
Christopher Snyder: I appreciate that. And then for my follow-up, I guess maybe more of a modeling question. For the revenue, Q1 revenue guide, the $1.245 billion at the midpoint, does that include $60 million from ESI implying about $1.285 billion at the midpoint for organic Keysight. It seems to be a pretty sharp fall off versus the 1327 orders we just got. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. $1.185 billion, not $1.285 billion, but your math is correct. $1.245 billion, less $60 million gets you to $1.185 billion for Core Keysight. And what we've typically seen is on the order side is a high single-digit sequential decline as we move from Q4 into Q1. And I think given the normalization, that we're currently seeing, particularly in EISG, we expect a sequential decline this year to be a little bit larger than historical average. And so that's -- and again, with orders and revenue converging, that's how you can think about getting to that $1.185 billion for Core Keysight.
Christopher Snyder: Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
Mark Delaney: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. A question on Commercial Comms. And do you think the company can get back to the historical highs in the Commercial Comms segment, in terms of revenue from a resumption in 5G alone? Or do you think you would need some contribution from things like 800 gig and 6G in order to get there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mark. Absolutely, we are confident in the long-term outlook for the business, I outlined at Investor Day several overlapping themes of technology waves that are playing out across end markets. And our view remains solid with that. In fact, as we engage with customers even through this time, where the spend has been lower, customers are intensely focused on higher priority R&D programs. And so that strategic view has not changed for us. Obviously, there is this current demand normalization that's occurring after fiscal '21 and '22, where we had outsized order growth in the business. And so post normalization, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow the business, because of these multiple ways of technology across both wired and wireless ecosystem.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful. And other question on the competitive landscape with one of your competitors having recently been acquired. Have you seen any change in any opportunities in terms of new business wins or any changes on the competitive front that you would point out? Thanks.
Mark Wallace: Yes. No, we remain active in all of the markets that we serve. The automotive market, in particular, continues to be quite robust with many customers investing in long-term EV projects, which we continue to engage with. So no, we've not seen any change since any recent announcements.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please proceed.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Congrats on the strong Q4. Can you give a little more color into what is going on in China and whether you're seeing any green shoots there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I'll have Mark make some comments, but thank you. We're pleased with the execution and the operational performance of the business in fiscal '23. Our engagements in China with customers remain strong, but I'll have Mark make some comments by end market.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Our business in China remains very diverse. We did see softer demand in Q4 and in the second half. And actually, our business in China held up relatively strong in the first half, especially from the EISG standpoint. But there is incremental weakness in manufacturing and in semiconductor, and we expect that to continue for the next couple of quarters. Where I see the activity is around the areas that, we have remained focused on high-speed digital, optical, auto and EV and AE and opportunities for mature semiconductor technologies continue there as well. I also think we've de-risked quite a bit of the trade impact that we've been experiencing for the last several years. We'll watch that carefully. It's been fairly status quo, I would say, for the last couple of quarters. And if we do see some moderation to the demand normalization on the manufacturing side, I think we'll be very well positioned when that happens.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thank you, Mark.
Mark Wallace: Yes.
Operator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi. Please proceed.
Atif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The first one for Satish, you guys are seeing stability in 5G market maybe restocking in China smartphones. And it sounds like you're optimistic about second half of next year. Is it possible for you to provide us a few milestones on the next 5G standards and maybe earlier rollout of 60 that we should be looking forward to for next year?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think at the highest level, the things, that I watch for are the continued progression, the smartphone industry is making in inventory reductions, right, that's been talked about for chips and final device form factors. So that's one thing we watch. Obviously, when we think about the 5G standards progression, what we're seeing so far is increased interest from customers in Open RAN, even in our 5G business this year, Mark and team have added new customers to our already strong mix of installed base customers. So our leadership position continues to remain strong and we're continuing to remain differentiated with our portfolio, which is very broad and cares to the need of the entire ecosystem. The area that has also gained a lot of importance, as we went through the last year, has been the non-terrestrial networks so the satellite cases with 5G. And we're also seeing some interesting new use cases associated with Release 17 and the research interest across the globe to build organic IP in what comes beyond 5G has already kicked off and Keysight continues to play an early role in partnering with these customers. So when we look at our investment priorities. Yes, we're investing in R&D, but and we're focused on that -- focusing that investment around these next-generation themes, which will continue to enable us to be strong and grow the business over the long run at the rates that we've put out at the Investor Day.
Atif Malik: Great. And then a follow-up for Neil. Neil, you talked about orders down high single-digits, in the January quarter because of EISG being down more than historical average. And you're pointing to an April quarter revenue trough because of ESI seasonality. Should we be thinking about orders recovering in the April quarter or coming down with that revenue decline?
Neil Dougherty: On Core Keysight, we would typically see a sequential increase, as you move from Q1 to Q2. I think we'll need to wait for some time to pass, but to give you a sense of how that increase is going to compare to historic norms. But typically, you would see a Q1 to Q2 increase. And I think based on everything we see at this point, that's what we expect.
Atif Malik: Great. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
Matthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. I have one follow-up to a prior question and one other one for Neil. In terms of the follow-up. So we're talking about a softer than seasonal outlook for Core Keys, stripping out that 60-ish million from ESI in fiscal 1Q. Is that primarily EISG i.e. are their expectations for more relative stability to sustain in comms and some of the strength to persist in ADG? So more just sort of unpacking that outlook for fiscal 1Q, across the segments? And then maybe for Neil, you're talking about CapEx of about $150 million. I think at the Analyst Day, it was around a $225 million mark for fiscal '24. I'm just wondering what's changed?
Mark Wallace: Yes. So on the first question regarding the seasonality, I think you have it mostly right. I think we're experiencing incremental softness in EISG and then a lot of that is in China and Asia. And that's what we're attributing to the slightly expected higher seasonal decrease for Q1. And then the second.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. On the CapEx, I mean, obviously, the business has been softer this year than we expected. And so when you think about investments in capacity and those types of things, we have either canceled in many cases or delayed other programs in response to the current macro environment, which is resulting in the reduced expectations for CapEx going forward.
Matthew Niknam: Great. Thank you, both.
Neil Dougherty: In '24. You're welcome. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please proceed.
Tim Long: Thank you. Two, if I could. First, on the Wireline side, could you talk a little bit more specifically about optical kind of what you're seeing there? Where are we in cycle, it's been a little bit more challenged with some of the companies in the ecosystem. So if you could just talk about what you're kind of seeing on the physical test side, as well as Ixia. And then, just the second one on the Defense Automation business. It seems to be continuing rolling along really strong. Could you talk a little bit about sustainability of that kind of defense line, over the next multiple quarters? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. Sure. I'd say we've always believed that strategically, having both the physical and protocol and having a leadership position across both is an advantage, and we'll see that play out at this point, especially as the challenges migrate between SerDes and the Optical side and the Electrical side and our ability to connect the dots for our customers is an advantage for us, and we're able to monetize the advantage. I would say 400 gig Ethernet still continues to be the predominant investment standard with customers shifting priority to 800 terabit and beyond, from a research perspective or development perspective, and we're able to engage across that entire life cycle. Which has caused the sequential uptick we see. And we also see some of that. I'll have Mark make some comments on the funnel of opportunities as we look ahead. On the Defense side of the business, again, not only in the US but across the globe, the increased spending in technology investments in Aerospace and Defense is a trend that's playing out. In the US, I would say the prime contractors have been referencing growth in backlog and growth in orders. And I think all of that, we've seen a stronger uptick, I should say, in the Aerospace Defense business, in the most recent quarter. But equally, that bodes well for 2024. Obviously, we watch the Defense budget getting passed because that's an important milestone for that business. But I think given the bipartisan support that exists, we can be reasonably confident about the outlook for Aerospace and Defense in fiscal '24. I'll have Mark make some comments.
Mark Wallace: Yes. There's not much to add. Satish has covered it well. But what we've seen is this pattern of R&D and manufacturing on the wireline side. And we saw an uptick in 800 gigabit manufacturing spend for optical transceivers, feeding into network build-out and data center upgrades. So we saw a sequential improvement and the funnel would support that continuing. We saw AI server and GPU infrastructure testing also on the physical side. So there's some demand growth there. And as you pointed out, our broader portfolio in protocol solutions was reflected in some of our network visibility growth, particularly from enterprise customers. So these are all strengths that we were able to capture during Q4.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please proceed.
David Ridley-Lane: Good evening. Thank you. So just really quick question on the margins. If I'm understanding sort of the seasonality comments on the ESI Group, that actually should be very modest, but it should be a tailwind to margins in the first quarter? So I completely understand the revenue guidance, but is there anything onetime that's implied in the first quarter margin?
Neil Dougherty: You should be able to bridge from the Q4 results that we just put up to the Q1 guide, even if you adjust for the ESI, really with two bridging items. The first is the increase in the tax rate from 12% to 17%. And the second is the implied reduction in revenue, right, which we just talked about, goes from $1,311 million to $1,185 million so about $125 million reduction in revenue should be sufficient to bridge the delta.
David Ridley-Lane: Okay. And then for the full year, I know there were several project push-outs in semiconductors and other areas, maybe more broadly in China. But could you size sort of the full year impact of orders in fiscal '23, from those kind of project push-outs. And then look, it's always uncertain, but if the construction time line has stayed intact, should we expect sort of a similar magnitude to show up in fiscal '24?
Neil Dougherty: I'm not sure I follow your question. If people are pushing out and we have confidence that they're ultimately going to take delivery of product, generally speaking, we leave those orders on the books.
Mark Wallace: Are you speaking about semi specifically with fabs? Is that?
David Ridley-Lane: It was revenue and so if it was an order that tied to a semi fab, where the construction itself got pushed, that status orders, and you would just recognize the revenue later.
Neil Dougherty: So you're talking about where deliveries got pushed out of three out of '23 and '24 and beyond?
David Ridley-Lane: Yes.
Mark Wallace: Yes. So on semi specifically, I think there's two factors. One is the forward-looking demand, some of that has been pushed out because of delays in the fabs. And then the second part is delays of backlog. And I think you characterized it right going into late '24 and early '25.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you for your question. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would like to now turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Sarah, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Just to wrap up the call, I'll turn it over to Satish, and over to you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. I want to thank all our shareholders for your support of Keysight. And I want to let you know, we remain incredibly confident in our future, and we're continuing to invest for growth around next-generation technology teams, which have strong customer validation. While doing so, we're also prudent in our spending and maintaining a strong discipline from an operating perspective in factoring in the current environment. And finally, we're also very confident in the free cash flow position of the business, and you've seen us in the most recent quarter, buy back over 100% of our free cash flow in our own shares, given the valuation at this time. Thank you very much and hope you have a good rest of your day.
Operator: That concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2023 Q3  (2023-08-17 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cole, and I'll be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Thursday, August 17, 2023 at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Keysight's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2023. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, we'll be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information that supplement today's discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under the financial information tab and quarterly reports. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly-comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them. Please review our recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and Citi. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Keysight reported solid results in the third quarter, demonstrating the strength of our portfolio and the resilience of our financial model. We are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders in a challenging macro-environment. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, we delivered another quarter of strong financial performance demonstrating Keysight's diversified portfolio, strong execution, and operating discipline. Third quarter revenue was in-line with our expectations, while record earnings per share exceeded our guidance range. Second, while orders came in at the low end of our expectations, we saw positive and steady customer R&D spending and continued stability in commercial communications. Growth in aerospace, defense and government and growth in our automotive EV and AV solutions, partially offsetting incremental softness in EISG and Asia, primarily related to semiconductor and other manufacturing. This backdrop has tempered our near-term expectations for orders and revenue. We've factored this dynamic into our outlook for Q4, while now expecting full-year EPS growth of 7%. Third, despite the near-term challenges, Keysight's diversified business, differentiated solutions, and durable operating model give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends of our markets, as well as outperform in a variety of market conditions. Now let's take a deeper look at our third quarter results. While orders declined 15%, revenue of $1.38 billion was up 1% on a core basis and a record for the third quarter. Our differentiation and strong execution resulted in gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 31%. We delivered $2.19 in earnings per share, which was an all-time high. Turning to the demand environment, we continue to see steady investment in strategic R&D programs in commercial communications, aerospace, defense and government and automotive EV solutions. In fact, over the past year, we've seen a meaningful growth in large long-term customer commitments related to strategic programs, particularly in automotive and ADG. We view this as an important validation of our strategy, it puts us in a strong position in key emerging technologies and positions us well for future growth. Demand was incrementally weaker in Asia this quarter as customers deferred manufacturing-related spending in semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive markets in many cases well into next year. Taken together, the increase in our customer strategic program investment combined with soft near-term demand environment is moderating revenue in the fourth quarter, which Neil will discuss in more detail. Turning to our business segments. Electronic Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 14% to another quarterly record and the 12 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. The strong financial performance was driven by double-digit growth across all markets and regions. EISG orders in the third quarter trended lower, particularly in semiconductor and manufacturing. Our customer engagements remain high as they're planned for, and continue to invest in key long-term strategic initiatives. In semiconductor, despite a near-term pullback in capital spending for wafer capacity, the industry is marching forward and planning for a strong future demand environment. In the near term, customers are prioritizing new applications such as silicon photonics to address the AI demand. As a result, this quarter we did see significant slowdown in our new wafer test solutions, while demand for Keysight's silicon photonics test and proprietary interferometer systems remained high. We expect these dynamics to continue over the next few quarters. In automotive, investments in EV and AV technologies continued to be strong. This quarter we secured a third strategic win with another large European OEM to supply an EV battery test system that includes our PathWave Lab automation software. This program will be implemented in 2025, and we're quite excited to be working with industry leaders and supporting their goals. To address customer needs for wireless tracking, diagnostics and connected vehicle communications, Keysight also announced support for automated RF testing for Autotalks’ C-V2X chipsets on our PathWave Test Executive software platform. In general electronics, the growing collaboration between universities and companies is driving further investment in our solutions for advanced research. We're also expanding on our customer engagement in digital health solutions to support the growing digitalization and connectivity requirements of this industry. Turning to Communications Solutions Group, revenue declined 5%, while the overall stable demand environment continued quarter-to-quarter. Aerospace, defense, and government revenue grew 11% with strong demand from U.S. government and primes. Keysight's differentiated signal generation and threat scenario emulation capabilities led to a large U.S. Air Force contract in Q3. We also won a key contract from leading Canadian prime contractors for electromagnetic spectrum operation applications. In addition, the demand for our radar and defense modernization solutions grew robustly as prime contractors placed orders for systems that support their delivery goals in 2024 and beyond. Government research demand and investment in 5G and 6G continued as well. Commercial Communications revenue declined 12% due to cautious spending by customers and weaker manufacturing activity in smartphone, PC, and component supply chain. Customer engagements remained strong with R&D investments in key technology to support 5G and 6G AI/ML-driven high-speed datacenter networking and satellite communications. Demand for our wireline applications improved sequentially driven by cloud provider and hyperscaler investments as they designed their networks for AI and ML workloads. Enterprise customer and key service provider investment was steady, driven by increased digitization, heavier network loads, and rising cyber security concerns. In wireless, 5G standards are progressing and we saw steady R&D investment in Open RAN, satellite, non-terrestrial networks and 5G RedCap Release 17 capability targeted at industrial and IoT applications. Early 6G engagements continued this quarter. We enabled the University of Stuttgart to advance 6G integrated circuit research with our sub-Terahertz solutions. Keysight also led the agreement between the 6G-SANDBOX consortium and the European Space Agency to further research to integrate terrestrial 5G/6G technologies and satellite networks of the future. This quarter, we continued to strengthen our technology leadership in the industry and enable our customers' innovation. For example, we extended our flagship network analyzer portfolio by introducing industry's first integrated platform with vector component and analysis capabilities for power amplifier and component design applications. We also announced industry's most comprehensive multi-speed ethernet performance platform supporting data center interconnects up to 800 gigabit ethernet that are critical for data-intensive applications such as AI. And lastly, Keysight enabled 3GPP protocol conformance validation for Release 17 non-terrestrial networks and is continuing to partner with new satellite operators like Skylo to accelerate the deployment of satellite networks. Software and services remain an integral part of our solution strategy and again accounted for one third of total company revenue. Overall, software and services revenue grew year-over-year reflecting the continued expansion of our software-centric solutions. We remain confident in the long-term secular growth of software intensive R&D applications, particularly earlier in our customers' development process. In line with this trend and the software system simulation opportunity that I laid out at our March Investor Day, this quarter we announced our intent to acquire ESI Group, a leader in virtual prototyping solutions for the automotive and aerospace markets. The addition of ESI broadens our software capabilities into physical simulation and furthers our strategy of moving upstream into earlier stages of our customers' design cycles Keysight's technology leadership and deep collaboration with industry players remains a significant competitive advantage. Despite current macro uncertainty, we see continued investments in R&D driven by multiple waves of technology innovation and broad-based industrial digitalization and connectivity needs. While continuing to invest in these long-term secular growth trends, we remain disciplined and have driven incremental cost efficiencies throughout the organization this year. Our current guidance expectations are to finish the fiscal year 2023 with 7% EPS growth and 1% revenue growth. We believe this financial performance exemplifies the strength of Keysight's differentiated first-to-market solutions portfolio, our durable and resilient business model, and our winning culture which altogether positions us well for continued market outperformance. With that, I'll turn the call to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered solid financial performance in Q3. Revenue of $1.382 billion was just above the midpoint of our guidance range, flat year-over-year and up 1% on a core basis. Orders of $1.244 billion declined 15% on a reported and core basis. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $478 million, resulting in record operating margin of 31%. We achieved net income of $393 million and delivered record earnings at $2.19 per share. Our weighted-average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $918 million, down 5% on a reported and core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $611 million declined 12%, while aerospace, defense and government revenue of $307 million was up 11%, driven by increasing defense budgets worldwide and investments in technology modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered gross margin of 68% and record operating margin of 30%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $464 million, up 14% or 15% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 34%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash-flow from operations of $241 million and free cash flow of $196 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 930,000 shares at an average share price of $162 for a total consideration of $151 million. Now with regard to our outlook. Exiting the quarter and as Satish mentioned, the demand environment was mixed with areas of stability and growth partially offsetting pockets of incremental softening. In addition, the composition of our order mix has changed over the past year. Our ability to deliver differentiated solutions and innovate at the pace of our customers has resulted in meaningful growth and strategic long-term customer commitments, which will deliver high-quality revenue over multi year periods. These commitments were approximately 2% of orders in Q3 year-to-date last year and are approximately 8% of orders year-to-date this year. Turning to our fourth quarter guidance, which incorporates these factors, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $5.5 billion, representing 1% growth. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $1.89 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Full year earnings per share at the midpoint of our guidance is $8.19, representing 7% growth. As we look to next year with the capitalization of R&D, the pending increase in the guilty tax-rate on offshore earnings, and efforts by the OECD to establish a global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, we now estimate that our non-GAAP tax rate beginning in fiscal year 2024 will be in the range of 15% to 17%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Cole, please give the directions for the Q&A.
Operator: Of course [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Yeah. Hi, so many thanks for taking my question. Hi, Satish. Can you hear me?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We can hear you.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi. Can you hear me? Yes. Hi.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We can hear you,
Samik Chatterjee: So, if we can start with EISG where you said demand trends or order trends are stable. Maybe if you can sort of dig into that a bit more because there have been concerns given that the smartphone ecosystem still remains really sort of below average in terms of demand that there could be further weakness there. What are you seeing in terms of wireless versus wireline, particularly interested in understanding if you're seeing any demand uplift from all the uptakes in the AI applications on the wireline side? Just maybe dive into that a bit more. And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Sure, Samik. Let me just start by saying, the Keysight team executed very well under these conditions, and you see that reflected in the strong quarter and year-to-date performance. Based on our guide we expect to deliver 7% EPS growth for the year, on 1% revenue and we're maintaining solid profitability. So that's sort of the baseline. And then when we looked at the orders, obviously the orders were down 10% year-over-year in Q2, and when you look at our orders right now for the quarter that we reported, were down 15%. A big part of that decline year-over-year came from our Greater China operations which were associated with the slowdown in production, which impacted the EISG business which was actually holding up pretty well till the first half. And we expect that this dynamic to last a few more quarters, again, we think it's transient. And I want to stress that based on all of the customer engagements, including the fabs that we engage with, they continue to believe that this is a temporary situation that is playing out. Now I also want to sort of elevate this to a regional perspective, because it will get at the core of your question. Our Americas business grew this quarter on top of a record Q3 a year ago, and Europe was stable driven by strength in EV and AV. And again, I'll go back next to the segment perspective, commercial communications continued to be stable, and I'll get a little bit into the different segments. Aerospace and Defense grew, and EISG, as I mentioned before, incrementally declined. From a commercial communications perspective, 5G investments in R&D continued to be stable. And what was driving some of that is, yes, we still are yet to see any uptick in the manufacturing business associated with the components and that's correlated with your smartphone -- declines in the smartphone -- in general smartphone volumes. But I think the driver here is the premiumization of the smartphone market, right? And that is really resulting in those customers that have better than expected performance or earnings improvements have actually come back and pulled the trigger on investments with regard to their innovation needs in R&D. And this is again reconfirmation of some of our base-case thinking that the R&D investments are much more robust and our customers don't want to get behind. On the wireline side, the dynamics were influenced by AI as a number of hyperscalers are starting to look at the AI through the lens of AI their investments in data center. We started to see some uptick in investments in 800 gig, again, very preliminary, I don't want to draw too far conclusions, one quarter doesn't make a trend, but the stability two quarters in a row, we're quite encouraged by that given the economics. And I also think the breadth of Keysight's portfolio and the contributions we're making end-to-end to the communications ecosystem is enabling us to outperform. I would say our Network and Security business or Network and Application Security business, which was formerly Ixia business has also been holding up pretty well through the year and I believe we're continuing to take share. I'll wait for the second part of your question.
Samik Chatterjee: Yes, please. Thank you. Thanks for that. For -- relatively sort of again thinking in relation to orders and if orders -- sort of your thoughts on what orders -- what we need to see in terms of orders going into next year for Keysight to be able to get back to the long-term growth outlook that you have on the revenue side, particularly in relation to, I think, historically, your orders and revenues have been pretty tightly correlated. So how you're thinking about what you need in terms of orders? And maybe one thing to clarify is, I didn't really fully comprehend the implication of what Neil is mentioning in terms of more long-term strategic orders from your customers. Is that necessarily a divergence between sort of what you would see on order trends versus that translating into revenue next year? Any thoughts on that, please?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, I'll just make some high-level comments. First is, the successes we are having in this environment is a function of execution, but also a function of the breadth of the company and all the different end markets we serve. Obviously, we don't control the macro, but we're able to figure out where there is strengths and we're able to maximize, such as in aerospace, defense and automotive with AV and EV, which is going through a bit of an uptick in the market and we're able to capitalize on that and outperform. I'll just let Neil speak about the guide and the comments he made about our system integration business and associated revenue implications there.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Hi, Thanks, Samik. Yes, so as you think about orders, obviously, through the first quarters of this year, we've been able to run revenues at a level that was materially higher than the incoming order rate as we work through some of the backlog that we built up over the COVID period of time and then the supply-chain disruptions of the last 12 to 18 months. And as we look-forward, we've seen this degradation in the demand environment this quarter that is going to put some pressure on orders as we move into Q4 and likely into Q1. And so, our ability to continue to drive revenue based on backlog is becoming incrementally challenging, right? We've burnt about $300 million -- burnt through about $300 million of backlog so far this year, that's the rate at which revenues have outpaced orders. And then I talk about this change in mix towards longer-dated system, so it is a small portion of our business, which we haven't talked about much because it's been consistently less than 5% where we're working on larger-scale strategic programs that are delivered over an extended period of time to our customers. And we view it as very positive that our customers are continuing to invest in those kinds of projects, that portion of our business was roughly 2% of orders through three quarters last year, it's about 8% of orders through three quarters this year. And what that essentially means is an addition to the $300 million we -- a backlog we burnt, we've taken another $200 million of short-dated backlog and turned it into long-dated backlog. And so, as you think about our guidance for Q4, it's essentially built on the scheduled backlog that we have set to deliver into the -- into next quarter, and our own view of orders for the coming quarter and our ability to turn a portion of those orders into revenue within Q4.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Samik, I think just to add to what Neil said, this $200 million that Neil referenced roughly, these are high-quality customers making long-range commitments, further validating our strategy with them. And these are -- you can think of them as large aerospace defense companies that are looking towards -- looking to us to provide more comprehensive solutions and systems. And in the automotive application, especially with regard to EV and AV, we're offering total solutions, including power management and software for workflow automation and all of those take time for us to complete those projects in tandem with their bring-ups of their gigafactory. So they're highly coordinated, highly strategic to the customers. And I view this as giving us a further penetration with new applications supporting our long-term growth rate.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik.
Operator: Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. And two for me. Just as a follow-up to your commentary to the prior question. I just wanted to get a better understanding, especially in terms of backlog normalization, it's good to hear of strategic orders longer-term and the inherent business is also driven by some of the R&D projects. And in that context, should we assume that backlog normalization is into full gear? And then your backlog could remain in a level that would start with a two-zip code? And I'm not asking for order guide, but I just want to better understand how you see the post-COVID normalization of backlog is trending against some of the pluses and minuses in various parts of the business. And I have a follow-up.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, Mehdi, I think that's largely correct, right. I've talked over the past year about the fact that we felt like we had built -- excuse me $400 million to $500 million what I call abnormal backlog. And as I just stated, we burnt through $300 million of that through three quarters of this year and then we've essentially converted another $200 million of essentially short-dated turns backlog into backlog for these long-dated programs. So I view that we've materially worked through that abnormal backlog at this point and I don't think it's unrealistic to assume that in this environment our kind of normalized backlog level will have a two handle on it.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I also thank Mehdi to the point I think you're alluding to is software and services, we continue to be stronger even in this environment for us, again reflecting the strength of our customer relationships. And so the deferred balance is also a factor that is elevated that leads to the two zip-code calculation you have.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, great. And my follow-up has to do with the semi-mix. I think you mentioned that the semi-bookings or new orders were weak in the quarter. Is that due to the delayed ramp of tape-outs for 3 nanometers? And if that's the case, should we assume a rebound in semi-related orders as we start with the new fiscal year, fiscal year 2024?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Mehdi, I think what you've probably seen public announcements from major fabs around pulling back of wafer capacity, so some of the investments associated with our parametric test systems, which typically feed the fabs have been pulled back, especially around legacy technologies and memory applications. So as that rebounds, you can expect that capacity to rebound. Again, this is an area where we have good customer visibility given long-standing relationships that we have had. But it's also a tale of two words because the same customer base is focused with us relentlessly about the advanced node development, about new application areas such as silicon photonics which in today's world translates to AI. And we also have another business that we've talked about in the past around making interferometer systems for two nanometer sort of technologies. And there, there is no change in demand because we are working with customers on enabling this technology. So, yeah, there is a pullback in the near term. But again, I want to stress this is temporary and transient.
Mehdi Hosseini: I just want to understand would increase 3-nanometer tape-out next year have a positive impact for your semi-business?
Satish Dhanasekaran: I'll have Mark Wallace take that.
Mark Wallace: Yeah. Hi, Mehdi. What I can say is that despite the pullback in the short-term, the engagement with our customers on advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer, 4-nanometer, 2-nanometer have continued. And many of these customers are looking at a variety of aspects of their market as well as managing their financials. A couple of examples, one is we have a customer in the US that has delayed some of the fab build-out because of construction issues. So we expect that to -- we will correct itself in the next couple of quarters. We have another customer, again, working on these advanced node sizes and technologies, who has locations in the US and in Asia, and they're maintaining their total project plan and investment, but spreading the CapEx over several quarters. And there's a lot of those stories. So, it really feels to me like we are going through a phase of pullback. But the answer to your question is, yes, we expect this to positively impact our business in 2024.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. And Neil, I apologize to go back to this. But I want to be clear, what I'm hearing from you guys is that, it sounds like Neil you believe that backlog coming out of this quarter is basically near normalized levels in your opinion. And I guess what I'm really asking is that if I look back over the past couple of years appreciating that there is some variables with COVID and everything else involved. But it looks like seasonally, you typically see a sequential increase in your order growth in fiscal 4Q. I guess, as I look at that, are you expecting sequential or how would you characterize seasonal growth in orders? Or maybe rather discussing on a book-to-bill basis, embedded in your expectation for the fiscal fourth quarter at this point? I apologize for the confusing question, but I'm just trying to understand how you're seeing order growth and backlog.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. No, it's a fair question. So first off, do we believe backlog has normalized, and I'd say the answer to that is largely, yes. We believe backlog has normalized at this point. With regard to incoming order rates and seasonality, you're absolutely correct. We typically see a pretty sizable increase as we move from Q3 to Q4 at the end of our fiscal year and what I would say is, we do expect orders to be up sequentially from Q3 to Q4. But we expect a significantly smaller sequential increase than would be typical based on weakness of the funnel that materialized during the third quarter.
Aaron Rakers: That's fair. So a book-to-bill improvement from this level is basically what you're alluding to?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, I guess, I would think of it as with backlog having normalized, we would expect orders and revenue to start to converge.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess as a quick follow-up, just maybe the opportunity to ask you about the ESI acquisition. How do we think about that as far as the strategic positioning and what expectations or kind of targets we should be thinking about as far as that acquisition folding into the financial story as we move forward?
Satish Dhanasekaran: So let me take that, and Neil if you have anything to add, you could. First of all, I would say, it's a great strategic fit, one we're very excited about. I think you've heard me describe the system simulation and emulation opportunity as a near adjacency to the work that we do with customers, especially as we have focused the strategy on engaging with customers early and in their R&D workflows. So the addition of ESI really is a great fit there. Financially, it's accretive to our gross margins, it will be when we close the transaction. And we also think it will be accretive to our [SOFR] (ph) percentage by at least two points at the company level. And from a cultural perspective, I think it's very important as well. ESI is a company that's been around for 50 years and has been involved in some of the most complex simulations associated with crash testing and other areas. And I think with the -- by coming into Keysight and what's exciting is the combination of that can now not only provide go-to-market capabilities that can further accelerate growth but also engage with customers in new applications in aerospace, defense and other end-markets leveraging the deep technology expertise of ESI. So very excited by this transaction as we announced it. Thank you.
Aaron Rakers: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Wondering if the shift to the longer-term orders is that driven by things that you're doing internally or is this just a function of the demand that you're seeing from these large aerospace and defense and auto OEMs?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think some of it is the implementation of our solutions approach to what was otherwise markets that we had maybe sort of purely through the lens of products historically. I think of aerospace, defense, David, as an industry, where we largely sold instrumentation tools. And over the past few years, we've put focused effort to adding more value to the customer base by integrating the instruments, but also layering on software and creating more services opportunities. So some of it is a function of the go-to-market push that we've had, but also equally the acceleration in demand we see in specific areas such as automotive. And I'll have Mark maybe give you a couple of more examples to make a drill.
Mark Wallace: Well, it might be just better -- just to lay it out, because it's hard to imagine these. But these are very strategic, very complex engagements with customers. So if we think about an EV or a battery test lab, you're talking about multiple racks of equipment for testing cells and modules and packs, there's battery cyclers, there's low voltage interfaces for communication, there's a chiller to cool the batteries, then there's environmental chambers, their safety aspects, fixturing software, project management, installation, site prepping very, very complex business. And then the other thing that's really exciting for us is, this gets us deeper into the customer's business. As we announced in Q2 we won two new OEM sites, in Q2, we won another one in Q3. And over that last three months, we have now through the deeper visibility engagement across the R&D labs have uncovered many other opportunities within those customers and across the ecosystem. So it also has an additive effect in terms of finding new opportunities to contribute. So that's a typical example of why it takes longer.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Thank you for that. And then just on the fourth-quarter guidance, I think the kind of implied incremental margin is quite high. Is there something unusual about the margins in the fourth quarter this year?
Neil Dougherty: No, I mean, I think, obviously as I've got the Q4 numbers in front of me. We typically see some uptick in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4, various factors. But I'd start with the fact that in Q3, significant portions of population on summer holiday, spending less money as a result, and as they come back here into the fourth quarter, we tend to see a pickup. We do expect a little bit of a sequential decline in gross margin and a lot of that driven by the implied volume reduction as well as kind of how we're getting to the numbers.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. So, A, I guess, I wanted to just figure out relative to the order level we're at now, I know it sounds like we're going to get a maybe lower than seasonal bump in fiscal 4Q. But it sounded as though this may persist for a couple of quarters, at least based on current visibility. And so, what I'm wondering is, if we sort of stay at this $1.25 billion $1.3 billion range and we work through excess backlog, is it -- and I don't want to jump the gun on fiscal 2024. But what I'm effectively getting at is, I don't think it's hard to see a pathway to maybe more negative or slightly negative growth next year. So I just want to make sure that -- if that maybe sounds reasonable. And then just maybe, secondly, as we think about the EPS growth outlook, obviously you're facing a pretty sizable headwind it seems like from tax rate. And so, I'm curious just if there's any color you can add in terms of the margin structure and your ability to maybe effectively flux some of the margin upside that you've showcased in the past around COVID in the times of topline pressure. So, long-winded question, but any color you can provide would be helpful. Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So, obviously, we'll give you more color on FY 2024 here in three months. But obviously, we spent a fair amount of time thinking through it ourselves. And as you noted and as I've noted, through the first three quarters of FY 2023, we were able to drive revenue at a level that was significantly above the incoming order rate. As a result, we're going to have some difficult revenue comps as we enter 2024. As I'm thinking about the transition from Q4 into Q1, at least right now, I'm thinking about kind of the typical seasonal decline that we would see on the revenue line as we move from one period to the next. And then I think as we look forward beyond that right now, we don't see a catalyst right now that is going to drive a significant market recovery in the first half of the year. But I think we're looking to a recovery in the second half of the year because as Satish has said, we believe that much of what's impacting our markets at this point is temporary in nature, right? Our commercial communications customers are going to work through their inventory challenges, the major investments that we're seeing in fab capacity they've been delayed, but they're still moving forward and that includes investment for the insurance of supply for 2 and 3-nanometer, silicon photonics, silicon carbide, all of that stuff is moving forward. And on the technology side, their R&D investments continue, right? We're going to see additional standards releases for 5G, continued investments in 6G research, AI, quantum, AV, EV, all of that stuff is moving forward. With regard to EPS outlook again, tough, tough, tough revenue comps, but we're a disciplined organization, the flexible business model you've seen that in the results that we published year-to-date. I think going forward the challenge for us is to maintain balance, right? We're optimistic about the long-term, we're going to continue with the investments that are going to enable us to fully participate in the recovery when it happens, while at the same time relying on our discipline to drive EPS growth. We're certainly working to offset whatever tax impacts we can, but as you noted, the tax impacts are significant.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Just I want to also add that, you've seen us -- Matt, you've seen us stay disciplined and I think at the beginning of the year I did reference that we will be accelerating some of the synergy work that we were starting to plan for anyway and we've executed on that very well. And you can see year-to-date, our OpEx has been flat, even accounting for a lot of the inflation environments. So as we invest in these next-generation technologies that have high customer validation and we know will position the company to outperform over the medium-to-long term, we're also remaining prudent and disciplined towards the macro situation in the short term.
Matthew Niknam: That's great. Thank you, both.
Operator: Thank you, Matthew. Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So, I very much appreciate that the softer orders and the backlog burn is leading to the softer sequential revenue from Q3 to Q4. But I wanted to ask about the sequential margins. It seems like the guide puts margins maybe in the mid-28, so down 250, 300 or so basis points year-on-year -- sorry, sequentially. So looking at 80% sequential decremental, it seems very steep. Can you just maybe talk through why that margin fall off is so sharp sequentially? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, I'm not showing a quite as strong on my -- as I'm looking at my pages, you might want to -- with more time you might find it's not as steep as you're calculating at the moment. And I think I've highlighted the factors, we are expecting our gross margins to be down sequentially, Q3 to Q4, again volume dropping a significant portion of that. We did have -- in our Q3 numbers, we did have about $0.03 of kind of one-time effect spread across OpEx and gross margin, mostly related to some favorable one-time impacts with our health care plans. That's not expected to repeat. And then, again, we're looking at typical sequential increases in OpEx as we move from Q3 to Q4.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that. Thank you. And then I appreciate the guide on the tax next year for the non-GAAP 15% to 17%. I just wanted to -- I guess maybe a housekeeping one. Is there any change in the cash tax rate when we think about 2024 versus 2023? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: It's a little bit too early to tell, that's why I still have a range, I'll expect to tighten up that range on rate here in three months. Outside of even the things that I listed, one of the things that could impact cash taxes is this move towards the corporate [indiscernible] tax which will go into effect for us next fiscal year. So, right now, too early to tell. I'll make some comments in a quarter, I'll be better able to address that.
Chris Snyder: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon, guys. The revenue guidance for Q4 of minus 10% at the midpoint, do you see both segments down? Can you just help us on how that plays out between the segments?
Neil Dougherty: Just give me one second here. Yes. We certainly see -- I mean, we certainly see declines across both segments, which obviously for EISG, which has grown revenues pretty significantly through all three -- through the first three quarters of the year is a significant change. But we do see revenues down similar levels across both segments.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, helpful. And then in aerospace and defense, can you talk at all about the outlook there? It's been a well-timed acceleration offsetting some weakness in communication. Just wondering if the aerospace and defense can stay as strong.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think the -- if you look at the security environment around the world, there is no doubt that the defense budgets are getting bipartisan priorities in the US. Look at Japan, it also put out doubling of defense spend in the next five years. Europe raising defense spend and security spend as well. So I think this is a business, as we've always said, harder to call on a quarterly basis, but very easy to look at the long-term trend. And our goal is to continue to outperform it. So we expect Q4 to be seasonally strong generally with the end-of-the-year sort of budgets that come open.
Adam Thalhimer: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe first question for me, you guys have talked about a lot of new kind of extension areas that you're seeing traction, and particularly on the AI side. With the flat OpEx that you've noted, just wanted to get a sense of how you're making sure of kind of touch base with some other new customers that might be entering into this space or how you're finding better leverage through channels. And then as a second question, just as a reminder on the Communications Group, can you just kind of lay out what you would consider as kind of rough percentages of kind of maintenance standard, so 4G you're kind of existing 5G versus kind of the next-Gen portfolio. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would say we're preserving our R&D investments, so we can outperform the market -- continue to outperform the market as it rebounds in the medium-term to long-term, which we fully expect it to. With regard to AI, a lot of our customers are launching AI projects in their own way, whether it's in silicon or in the networking side. And so, there is a considerable channel leverage there for AI. Clearly, the move to 800-gig ethernet that I referenced with higher interface capacity, higher bandwidth, lower power per bit, all of this are plays to our strength and our leadership there is helping us pick up some orders and set ourselves up as this business scales that we expect it to. With regard to the comms segment, and commercial communications, three dynamics, right? I would say deployments are continuing to scale. Second, globally and as that scales the business there grows. Second one, it's really the standards progression, I would think of Release 17 new use cases are driving customer need. And then the research activities around the world around, I call it beyond 5G because it's too easy to -- too early to call it 6G yet because there's the standard. But beyond 5G that exploration is proliferating and I think it fits our strategy to address the R&D customer.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks.
Operator: Our next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Thank you for taking the questions. Follow-up question as it relates to 800-G ethernet and some of the AI activity you're seeing. You mentioned some orders already on that front, but you described it is still in the relatively early phases. Do you have a sense of when 800-G orders related to AI or are there reasons 800-G may become more meaningful?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think it's hard to put a timing there, but we've seen this sort of overlapping waves of technology really be the basis of our strategy, Mark. And having that exposure to both wireless and wireline is a core strength for the company and we're seeing that play out, even today, the diversity of applications that we pursue. I would say that the 800-gig ethernet abilities -- ability to be first-to-market have that capability is definitely helping us now win some early engagements which should set us up well as that industry scales. As the hyperscalers are coming out of the economic situation in their business and as they're starting to upgrade, they are looking at 800-gig ethernet for some of those technical reasons I just mentioned.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful, Satish. Thank you. And then on the ESI acquisition you made some comments already that were helpful, including the gross margin accretion. I apologize if I missed this. But can you talk a little bit more in terms of what it may mean in terms of EPS contribution when it's integrated and how is that progressing over time? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, this is Neil. We do expect that there's some complexities of doing a public deal in France, it takes a little bit longer than typical to get the deal fully closed, and for us to then, therefore, begin to start realizing the G&A synergies that we typically rely heavily on to drive EPS. But I think first and foremost, this is a business that we feel like we can grow pretty aggressively with obviously strong software-like margins, we can via the significant breadth and reach of our sales force to get them access to new market participants and then heavily leverage our G&A, our highly offshored low-cost G&A infrastructure to drive significant margin expansion for the business and ultimately drive EPS growth.
Mark Delaney: Got it. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.
Rob Mason: Yes, good evening. I wanted to go back to the conversation around these more strategic longer-dated orders. I'm not sure that I still fully understand what the ship schedule or revenue recognition timing would look like on those. And I'm just curious, as well as those have been booked into orders. Have you widened or changed the order booking policy around kind of shippable in next six months around those timing?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I would say -- yes. Thank you. I would say, again, this is a very small part of our business historically, so we've never had to speak about it. As a function of the lower order levels today, the presentation appears higher. But I'd -- so no change to our order acceptance policy, other than these are complex systems which requires a start work today by inventory and staff people to deliver to our customers. So they are on the books for the right reasons. They're high-quality deals that we feel good about.
Neil Dougherty: Generally uncancelable without significant penalty would be the last part of that I would make. And from a delivery schedule, you could think of them certainly beyond six months or they'd be within the standard, but you can think of it as in the case of a lot of the aerospace defense kind of 12 months, some of the auto ones are 18 months or more because they tend to be even longer types of programs for us to deliver. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, some of these deals are scheduled for revenue recognition out in 2025 upon delivery of the complete project to the customer.
Rob Mason: Understood. And just as a follow-up. Satish, the -- certainly ESI Group, certainly makes sense from the standpoint of moving upstream and staying very close to R&D and into simulation. But I'm just curious how do you think about the opportunity set beyond kind of core electrical engineering customer base, this is around more physical test. Do you start to -- it was ESI unique in that regard or do you start to look more broadly at things outside of electrical engineering test?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah, Definitely, the -- when we look at the entire system simulation emulation opportunities, what you really need is the ability to simulate very complex interactions or physical electrical and software capabilities. So again placed to the system strength that the company has, so having these assets in the company will allow us to identify new use cases and serve them differentially which I think puts us in a very unique spot given our entire portfolio and test now mirror it with the strengthening portfolio and design. I think we see this as a very unique positioning for the company, one that aligns with our software-centric transformation that we've been on. I also think that being a European asset, obviously a French asset has been in France, there is more opportunity with our US base of customers to really focus this go-to-market motion and accelerate growth and create greater value.
Mark Wallace: I would just add one thing to the exciting part is the alignment to the verticals, automotive, aerospace, defense, it's broadening our footprint and broadening our value to these important customers.
Rob Mason: Very good.
Operator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citi Research. Your line is now open.
Adrienne Colby: Hi, it's Adrienne Colby for Atif Malik. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask a clarifying question on orders, you had commented that the 15% decline in overall orders was heavily influenced by China. Just hoping you could clarify what you saw in the Americas and Europe if you were seeing improvements in the rate of year-over-year declines there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I've mentioned -- Adrienne, hi, a good question. Our Americas business grew quarter-over-quarter -- in Q3, and Europe was stable.
Adrienne Colby: And sorry, was that sequentially or year-over-year?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Year-over-year.
Adrienne Colby: Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask with regards to the long-term strategic multiyear engagements, you've been speaking about. Can you comment on how much of the growth in orders is a factor of up-selling or expanding some of the existing agreements versus new agreements? Just trying to get a sense of the number of customers that are falling into this category, if that's growing.
Mark Wallace: Yes, Adrienne. I think it's a combination, as I mentioned before, these strategic first-time wins with the automotive OEMs into themselves are long-dated and enlarged. And through the process, we work with the customers to up-sell and cross-sell capabilities and then get more visibility across other parts of the groups as they're oftentimes organized or across the ecosystem as well. So I think the way to think about it in its simple terms is these longer-term programs are about as strategic as we can get with our customers. So it opens up new opportunities to sell, including software and other aspects of delivering value services, et cetera. So we're excited about it and we're looking forward to continuing to deliver through these vehicles.
Adrienne Colby: Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Adrienne.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Hey, thanks, Cole. And thanks everyone for joining us. I'm going to turn it over to Satish for a few closing comments and then we'll wrap up the call.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thank you very much. I know we discussed quite a bit today, but I want to leave you with some -- few important takeaways. First, we're executing very well, maximizing our performance in the near-term and we're tracking to deliver 7% EPS growth with 1% revenue growth this year. Solid profitability in the business and you should take that away. Second, we have strong differentiated portfolio that's aligned with multiple end markets and customer priorities and this will continue to enable us to outperform, both in the near-term and will go stronger as market conditions change. You see the differentiation in our portfolio reflected in our ability to maintain strong gross margins in our business in these conditions. Third, we have a strong balance sheet, strong cash position, and we remain confident in our free cash flow generation capabilities in the business, and we will continue to maintain the balanced capital allocation approach that we described at Investor Day. Fourth, we have a proven operating model with a highly flexible cost structure, and which has been proven before and will continue to play out as we had projected as well. Fifth, we have a seasoned management team here that has experience in the business for decades, and will continue to remain proactive and balanced in navigating this environment and you've seen us do this already this year. Finally, I want to remind everyone that we remain incredibly confident and excited about the favorable long-term secular trends that are underpinnings of our growth strategy. This is around the next-generation technology waves, new addressable customers and industries, and R&D investment wave across multiple end-markets. We are focused on positioning the company to grow and emerge from this environment, stronger. Thank you very much for joining us today. I'll hand this back to Jason.
Jason Kary: Thank you. Satish. And that concludes our comments today. Have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your line.

===== 2023 Q2  (2023-05-16 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Elisa, and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] The call is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 16, 2023 at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the call over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead Mr. Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome everyone to Keysight’s second quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2023. Joining me are Keysight’s President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran, and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session we will be joined by Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. The press release and information to supplement today’s discussion are on our website at investor.keysight.com under the financial information tab and quarterly reports. Today’s comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to “core” growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions, or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company on today’s call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them. Please review our recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by J.P. Morgan, Baird, and UBS. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered a solid second quarter performance caping of a record first half of the year. Our consistent execution as we navigate near-term macro dynamics reflects the resilience of our diversified business and the differentiation of Keysight solution portfolio. My comments today will focus on three key headlines. First, our strong financial performance in the second quarter demonstrated the depth and the breadth of Keysight solutions and operating discipline. Revenue was at the high-end of our guidance and earnings per share exceeded our guidance range as we delivered record gross margin and record free cash flow. Second, orders in the second quarter were stable and consistent with our expectations. As near term macro dynamics play out, we're capitalizing on growth opportunities across our end markets with particular strength in automotive and global aerospace defense. And third, we remain confident in the long-term secular growth trends in our markets. While the current environment is uncertain, we are continuing to prudently invest for the future to build on our leadership positions and to deliver on the long-term strategy that are laid out at our Investor Day in March. Now, let's take a deeper look at our second quarter results. Orders declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. Record Q2 revenue grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Operational excellence combined with favorable software and services mix resulted in record gross margins of 67%, operating margin of 30%, record free cash flow of 370 million and earnings per share growth of 16%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered record Q2 orders, driven by demand in automotive and general electronics, representing 33% of the total company revenue, EISG revenue was an all-time high and grew 17% with strong double-digit growth across all end markets. This was also the eleventh consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for this business segment, which underscores our broad market reach and diversified portfolio. In automotive, we delivered strong double-digit revenue growth and secure new strategic wins with two large OEMs. Building on our strong position in this market, we introduced further automation and protocol test capabilities for our industry leading EV charging test portfolio allowing customers to accelerate their innovation, improved battery performance, and ease of charging are among the most critical capabilities EV developers are bringing to consumers today. Keysight’s complete solutions allow customers to develop batteries with better range and faster charging time and importantly to efficiently test their interoperability against all global infrastructure standards under real world conditions. General Electronics revenue grew by double-digits to reach an all-time high. We are capitalizing on opportunities across a broad range of applications. For example, in quantum and silicon photonics where we are seeing more advanced research investment. In digital health, where we closed deals with several prominent medical device customers for Keysight’s microwave sensing and imaging solutions, and an industrial automation where customers are developing components and products to connect factory and warehouse environments. Our outperformance in general electronics in a soft demand environment demonstrates the benefit of the broad and diverse set of applications and used cases that we enable. Semiconductor solutions delivered double-digit revenue growth, driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. Our strong relationships with key customers in wafer test and precision lithography provide us with long range demand visibility, which remains favorable, despite near-term inventory headwinds. We believe the long-term growth drivers remain intact, supported by the government investments in initiatives such as CHIPS Act, and advanced node development for small, more efficient, and multifunctional chipsets. Turning to our Communication Solutions Group, revenue declined 3% against a strong compare of double-digit growth last year. At 45% of company revenue, Commercial Communications revenue declined 7%, which reflects the normalization of demand environment that we referenced last quarter. We saw cautious, but stable spending across the communications ecosystem, particularly in the smartphone and PC computing markets as customers work through post-pandemic, inventory dynamics, and macro uncertainty. At the same time, our customers continue to invest in long range strategic R&D programs. Keysight’s first-to-market solutions are enabling future requirements in 5G, including non-terrestrial networks, release 17 capabilities, Open RAN, AIML driven data center networks, and early 6G research. After a 3-year pause, we saw strong global industry participation at Mobile World Congress and Optical Fiber Conference this year. At these events, we showcased our capabilities with the key industry players to advance new technologies and used cases. This quarter, we enabled Samsung to demonstrate 5G new radio non-terrestrial network used cases and satellite connectivity. In addition, we secured a key win in commercial space to test antennas, transceivers, and telemetry systems. Keysight is also enabling ongoing Open RAN adoption. For example, CableLabs used Keysight's Open RAN architect solutions to achieve key interoperability milestones. Regionally, we saw strength in India with ongoing 5G and Open RAN deployments. Strategic data center R&D activity continues to gain momentum and Keysight secured an early win with a leading customer to implement AIML used cases. Our unique and comprehensive solution stack, which spans the physical protocol and the application layers, is enabling us to capitalize on these new market and technology inflections. We are also continuing to advance early 6G research with industry leaders around the world. In Japan, we engaged with NTT DOCOMO, a new spectrum technologies for sub-Terahertz frequencies. In the UK, in collaboration with National Physical Laboratory and University of Surrey, we enabled connectivity at speeds greater than 100 gigabits per second using Keysight’s 6G testbed. Turning to our aerospace and defense government business, we achieved record second quarter orders and revenue. Double-digit order growth was driven by increasing defense spending worldwide. At 22% of company revenue, ADG revenue was up 7%. Defense modernization spending remains strong in radar and spectrum operations, while investment in space and satellite and ongoing research in 5G and 6G drove growth. We saw strong demand from the U.S. and European primes with spend picking up in next generation programs. We recently announced software based real time spectrum analysis solution allowing satellite network operators to provide users with the highest quality of service. Keysight continues to innovate to meet the needs of this evolving market. Software and services revenue growth across business segments was steady and represented over one-third of company revenue. Value-added solutions are becoming increasingly important in the evolving design, emulation, and test environments. In collaboration with Synopsys and Ansys, we recently announced a 79 gigahertz millimeter wave radio frequency reference flow for TSMC. This allows us to provide mutual customers with the solutions they need to push the boundaries of RF and millimeter wave design into applications for autonomous systems. Technology megatrends and customers innovation workflows are driving an expansion in software opportunities. We expect software and services growth to continue to outpace overall company growth over the next three years. Before I turn it over to Neil, I'd like to highlight some of the things that make me proud to lead this company. A collaborative and innovative culture is one of the strategic enablers for Keysight’s continued value creation and an enduring competitive advantage. We recently published our 2022 corporate social responsibility report, which showcases the progress that we have made against our commitments and we're proud to have significantly surpassed many key impact goals for fiscal year 2022. We also released our 2022 diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the company's accomplishments in building an inclusive workplace and expanding new STEM partnerships. To sum it up, our market leadership and deep customer relationships are sustainable competitive advantages. We’re guided by our Keysight leadership model and run the company to outperform and to consistently create value under all business conditions. We believe the structural and financial flexibility of our operating model enables us to be resilient in the current macro environment. I would like to thank our employees for exemplifying a high performance winning culture and consistently delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. With that, I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. 
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello everyone. We delivered exceptionally strong financial performance in Q2 demonstrating the resilience of our business model. Revenue of $1,390 million was at the high-end of our guidance range and grew 3% or 5% on a core basis. Macroeconomic uncertainty continued to impact demand in the second quarter and orders of $1,319 million declined 10% or 8% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported record gross margin of 67% and operating expenses of $504 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $380 million and delivered $2.12 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 179 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $937 million, down 3% or down 1% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $627 million was down 7%. Aerospace Defense and Government revenue of $310 million increased 7%, driven by investments in defense modernization. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 28%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $453 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis with double-digit revenue growth in automotive, general electronics, and semiconductor demonstrating the diversity of our markets. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 35%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $423 million and free cash flow of $370 million or 27% of revenue, which includes $107 million in one-time proceeds from the unwind of an interest rate swap. Now, turning to our outlook. In this challenging macro environment, the scenario we laid out last quarter for first half demand levels to persist through the remainder of the fiscal year is playing out. However, given the strength of our operating model and the actions we have taken to date, we now anticipate better earnings performance than previously communicated, with strong mid-single-digit EPS growth expected for the full-year. Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1.370 billion to $1.390 billion, and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.06 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. Despite ongoing uncertainty, Keysight's durable and resilient financial model positions us well to outperform in the current economic environment. Over the longer-term, we remain confident in the underlying demand drivers for our markets and our ability to execute and achieve our new raised long-term targets, as presented at our Investor Day in March. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Elisa, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Absolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess, if I start with the strong operating performance, I think, Neil, you were mentioning in your prepared remarks. Just maybe give us a bit more color there? Obviously, record gross margins, very strong operating margins in the context of sort of how the top line is playing out and how the macro is? What are the drivers behind the gross margin improvement? And overall, how much of this is just, sort of some of the supply pressures easing versus something that you, as you said, you've taken actions and sort of that's driving some of the improvement? If you can lay that out for us in terms of how sustainable that is? And I have a follow-up.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Samik, it's a great question. And to some extent, it depends on what your compare is over the past couple of quarters. A big driver of the sequential improvement from the last couple of quarters comes from the improvement in the supply chain. And in fact, I would tie it to the reduction in the third-party premiums that had, kind of peaked in the back half of this year and last year and into the first quarter of this year. On a year-over-year basis, it's really far more mix. We had significantly favorable mix relative to the mix that we saw in the same quarter a year ago. As to sustainability, I think obviously, we set a new – raised a gross margin target for this business of 66% to 67% over the longer-term. I think this is a great proof point in terms of showing our ability to achieve those kinds of levels. I don't necessarily know that we're ready to operate at this level continuously going forward, but we also raised the EPS guidance for the year relative to the scenario we laid out last quarter. And certainly, the operating margin performance – excuse me, the gross margin performance and the easing of the supply chain constraints and costs are a factor that led to that increased EPS guidance.
Satish Dhanasekaran: This is Satish here. If I can add to Neil's points, quite pleased with the financial performance in this environment. Obviously, both CSG and EISG showed gross margin improvements. In EISG, a lot of it was linked to volume, but if you look, the business model is solid, right? You look at the software and services, have been steadily outpacing the business – overall business growth for a long time now, and we expect that trend to continue. And I would say that that gives us confidence, as Neil pointed out, that as we continue to execute our strategy of going up the stack all the way from physical protocol and application layers, we'll continue to have more opportunities moving forward.
Samik Chatterjee: Got it. And Satish, if I can follow up with you on the demand side for Commercial Communications. You talked about the sort of customer spending patterns last quarter. Have you seen any more sort of broadening out of the weakness? I know some of your peers have talked about even some of the base station testing, et cetera, being a bit weaker. But have you seen any broadening beyond, sort of just the smartphone ecosystem of players and that weakness that you're seeing? And even interested in hearing what you're seeing from your customers in relation to, do you really see, sort of your Commercial Comms hit, sort of hitting a trough already and now starting to sort of stabilize at these levels? Because that's what the numbers are indicating, but interested to hear how you're thinking about it. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So, I think the headline on demand, I think, in orders has been stability, right? I think that's sort of the theme and it holds true even in Commercial Communications where, obviously, we discussed the dynamics of customers working through inventory corrections. Some of them are in a place where they're starting to think about next year's programs. They're starting to think about other programs. But then some of them are still working through the inventory correction situation in their business. So it's really dependent on different customers. But broadly, I would say, if you look at our 5G business, the R&D parts of the opportunity continues to hold up better, and there are different drivers there. And then you referenced the base station side, actually, was also holding up in-line with quarter one. And I think on the networking side, we had slightly down quarter-over-quarter. But all-in-all, it's holding up well at this time. I don't know that I would go as far as calling a trough or calling a bottom, but I – we remain focused on delivering to our customers' road maps. And we're seeing high engagement with our customers, particularly in comms after the OFC and Mobile World Congress, I think people are starting to think about what the future might bring, and there's tremendous opportunity to innovate and nobody wants to fall behind.
Neil Dougherty: And if I was just going to add on to that, I mean, just kind of catching on to that theme of stability that Satish mentioned. I think as we look at demand and turn that lens forward, we're thinking about second half demand that's largely in-line with what we saw in the first half, albeit with some seasonality attached to it. Typically, we would see Q3 tick down and Q4 tick up, not just because of the way we manage our sales compensation programs, but also particularly in this scenario, where one of the growth drivers that we're seeing in this market is aerospace defense and the fact that those markets tend to skew up in our fourth quarter.
Samik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Congrats on the execution.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Going back to backlog, I want to better understand how the normalization, especially post-COVID, is played out? And just for illustration, if I were to look at prior to COVID and look at like 3 years to 5 years of history, the next quarter revenue to prior quarter backlog averaged around 0.9, reflecting the nature of the business which has turned, COVID changed that. Your backlog went-up due to supply chain disruption. And as you look forward post-COVID, should we expect more of a turn business? And I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think maybe from a business model standpoint, as you know, we've been driving to increasing solutions, more software and services mix, higher ARR, and that's been part of the strategy for go-to-market and that could alter in a very moderate way, the mix. But at some point, yes, I think as demand gets back in-line, we would expect the supply and demand balance to be restored.
Neil Dougherty: Sorry, Mehdi. As I think about it from a backlog perspective, I think in terms of the backlog normalization, it's happening much like we laid out last quarter, right, that orders or revenues have outpaced orders in both Q1 and Q2. We expect that largely to continue here through the remainder of the year. And while we may not work through all of what I've, kind of had described as the abnormal backlog, we're going to work through a significant portion of that, if you think of it as kind of $80 million a quarter, kind of a run rate. And you are correct. As the supply chain situation is involved, we are once again becoming more and more reliant on turns business. Not quite back to where we were pre-COVID, but some of that is the fact of the, kind of the structural changes that have occurred in our business over that period of time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. Thank you. And I certainly don't want to take away anything from the demand drivers. And in that context, maybe you could remind us what are the key demand drivers looking forward, like 600 gig Ethernet [nearly] [ph] semiconductor? And to me, those dynamics are very different than the 5G investment cycle that you went through from 2017 through 2019. And then if you could just remind us how the next couple of years could be different than prior upturn?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. And as you know, we have a diversified portfolio, and we have diversified end market exposure that gives us plenty of opportunity to continue to expand our share position. We still only have 25% market share in our markets, and we have additional new [SAM] [ph] opportunities that I outlined at Investor Day. But if you just look at the high level, you'd say the innovation trends across our end markets continue to accelerate. And I think what we're seeing even during this time is customers are not pulling back on their long-term priorities, especially with regard to keeping their competitiveness going. And so, that is a trend that we expect to continue, and that would bode well for – in wireless Release 17 and new innovations that are coming up. And heading into 6G, which is on a road map for the industry. And in wireline, clearly, the move to 800 gig terabit Ethernet and multiple optimizations that networks have to go through in the world of AI-ML, I think that's another diversified opportunity for us that we're pretty excited about. And then you go into aerospace defense. I think research spanned across multiple nations of the world continue to remain strong as many nations are investing in organic IP. You look at supply onshoring or reshoring or security around supply chain, that is a demand driver. And when you look at semiconductor, the move – the road map is pretty secure to actually go through the progression from 7-nanometer to 5 to 3 to 2 and so on and so forth. So, we look at across our end markets, including the General Electronics business with digital health, and I didn't talk about the one that is currently inflecting, which is automotive, with EV and AV. And all these are secular trends. And I think our focus as a company on R&D innovations, enabling customers to go faster, is definitely – will put us in a good position to capitalize.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So, fiscal Q2 revenue came in below typical seasonality. And obviously, you guys have been talking about the cyclical slowdown, so not a surprise there. But I guess my question is, if the guidance calls for, kind of typical seasonality into the third quarter with top line largely flattish, can we take that or should we take that as a vote of confidence that the market dynamics or demand is not getting worse?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, as I said, I think we largely think – albeit at a lower level, we think – we largely see things as stable here as we move from the first half into the second half, right? I just talked about how on the demand side, we expect second half orders to be on par with the first half, albeit with the seasonality that I mentioned. And I think from a revenue perspective, the same is largely correct. We delivered [13.80] [ph] in Q1, guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q2. We did a little bit better. We've guided to [13.80] [ph] in Q3. And I think if you think about a level of revenue stability at about that level, you're thinking about it the right way.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that. And kind of taking that and following up on the guide. If my [back to] [ph] the envelope math is correct here, mid-single-digit EPS growth for the year would imply a pretty big decline in Q4, both versus Q3, but also year-on-year. And with top line seemingly at least, kind of stable, it would – it seems to be calling for a decline in margins. Any reason for that? I don't know if there's ever been a quarter where Q4 EPS came in below Q3. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Well, again, as I said, I think if you think about the top line for Q4, stability would be the term that I'd use to describe that. When it comes to EPS, I think on a year-over-year basis, you're not incorrect at modeling a decline. While Q4 a year ago was not that dissimilar from what we just delivered here in Q2, as we look into the back half of the year, as I said, we might not be able to sustain the gross margin quite as favorably as the mix we just delivered.  And then in addition, we want to see some incremental investments into some of the future technologies that are going to drive our markets as we move forward. So, I do think on a year-over-year basis, you will expect a decline in the fourth quarter.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. And I think just to add to the point, right, it is an uncertain environment that's out there. And I think when we speak with customers, the engagement levels are high. But in terms of them planning for budgets, they're really relying on their underlying business to pick-up. And so there's that dynamic which results in an elongated cycle to close the pipeline, and so that's the case. And our guide, we try to be central weighted. We're not factoring in any macro recovery nor are we factoring in any recovery from China reopening into the guide. And those could be upside, but the macro could get worse too. So, that's the way we see it, and we'll keep you updated.
Chris Snyder: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Also congrats on the execution in the quarter. A lot of questions that I had were already answered, but I want to go back to kind of the narrative around AI and ML, and maybe you can help just unpack a little bit of the demand insertion that you're seeing? Just maybe help us appreciate where and to what extent Keysight's involved in those opportunities? I'm just kind of curious, so just helping us appreciate a little bit more of the AI narrative and the demand drivers you're seeing?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think AI, it's safe to say that it's been under discussion for quite a long time, and you could say machine-learning algorithms are not that new. But what we're seeing now is a tick up in networks really thinking about the way to train AI models, the way to infer in an AI environment, and that creates some opportunities for us. I think Kailash has referred to that in our presentation at Investor Day as some pilots that we have going on. And fundamentally, you look at it at the high level, you have in a typical search not so traffic in the network. And with AI-ML, you have a lot of east-west traffic. And I think modeling that and being able to train your network to perform is going to become a differentiator. And I think having the full stack in wireless and [ wireline ] allows us to go address opportunities for our customers. How big that could be, I mean, to be determined. But I do know that a lot of our customers are having discussions with us at this time, and we're continuing to invest in this new emerging opportunity.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, I noticed this quarter, you did not repurchase any share. I think that's the first time in a little while. So, Neil, I'm just curious of how you're thinking about very strong free cash flow? How you're thinking about share repurchase, maybe M&A, just overall capital allocation given the strong balance sheet position?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. There have been no changes to our capital allocation priorities. Obviously, we re-laid them out at our Analyst Day in March. We continue to look for opportunities to grow our business via value-accretive M&A. While we didn't purchase any shares during the quarter for a variety of reasons, we've been very active in the buyback markets and would expect that our – to continue to be least anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and be opportunistic on top of that. And so, we continue to believe there is ample opportunity for us to create value through appropriate capital allocation.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: This is [Will Brian] [ph] asking a question on the behalf of Mark Delaney. So, first question is, with orders down year-over-year, will easier comps in backlog be enough for the company to grow at that 5% to 7% target that you laid out next year if the macro is still similar to current conditions or would the macro need to improve at all to reach that goal?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. As we said, the macro environment continues to remain highly uncertain, and we're not ready to make a call as to what the environment is going to be 6 months from now when we get to FY 2024. I think what we see right now is largely stability, and as Satish just said, we're not ready to call an upturn, but nor do we have any additional downside baked into what we're seeing currently.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And my second question, I just wonder if you can comment or give some additional color around regional order trends at all? Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Sure, Will. This is Mark. I'll talk about the region trends. So, it begins with the word stability. We talked about that many times already. Q2 orders were steady and predictable and really consistent with our expectations. We saw increased customer demand and increased customer engagements with continuing focus on their R&D programs across all four regions. This was especially shown in the case for aerospace and defense, where we saw strong growth in demand across all of our regions. We saw the demand in automotive continue with some key wins, a couple of key OEM wins, particularly in Europe. And in general, the broad base of customers and the variety of applications that we serve within General Electronics really held up strongly across most regions as well. We did see some pullback, as we saw in Q1, around commercial comms that was centered with some of our larger customers in the Americas. We saw some pullback in short-term demand with semiconductor in Asia. But in general, across all regions, we saw this continuing stability in engagements and order flow as we expected.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: Great. Thanks. It looks like you guys bring down about 100 million of backlog this quarter and you had been kind of guiding to about $300 million of backlog for the remainder of the year, so it seems like everything is on track there. I guess I just wanted to get an update as to whether, kind of 200 million of additional backlog for the year was a good estimate? And just kind of what segment that's most concentrated on? And then just a second question, just in terms of where you're seeing some of the more cautious spending on comms? Is that legacy standards? Just kind of what projects are being potentially pushed out while, kind of emphasis is still being put on 6G, kind of new releases of 5G? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you. Meta, I'll take the second part first and then Neil will speak to the backlog. I think the – in comms, obviously, the big driver is new innovation, new technology trends. So, we saw strength in Release 17, non-terrestrial networks, all of the same themes that we've been talking about, and some increased investments around the globe around the next-generation technologies. And so, largely in R&D, the trends are holding.  And in production environments, our production test environments is where we're seeing much more weakness in demand as customers are digesting this excess inventory associated with smartphones and PCs and such. And our share position, even though at a lower level, continues to be strong, and we're focused on our portfolio and our portfolio continues to grow, and we'll continue to release new products in alignment with customer needs. With regard to the backlog position, obviously, we have a backlog situation. As Neil mentioned, we have a growing deferred revenue balance with increasing focus we have placed on software services and ARR. And we also, in accordance with where we're seeing the order strength, whether it's automotive or in semiconductor or in aerospace defense, we're also providing more system type of capabilities to our customers, which have longer lead times. Neil will give you more specifics.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I think on the backlight side, you referenced our comments about expecting to burn somewhere around $300 million of backlog for the year. I mean, that statement was made last quarter when revenues outpaced orders by $80 million, and we talked about how we expected that demand environment to sustain itself for at least the next couple of quarters. And that's, in fact, what's playing out. So, if you think about kind of an $80 million backlog burn per quarter, you get to [320] [ph], and that's largely how we're thinking about it with orders and revenue largely stable into the back half of the year. And the last question you asked is, how does it skew by business? Right now, it's clearly skewing towards CSG.
Meta Marshall : Okay. Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey guys. Nice quarter. Neil, the working capital was pretty negative in 2022, and it looks like it’s, kind of finally starting to swing positive in Q2. Do you expect that trend to continue in the back half cash from working capital?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, it's certainly something we're watching carefully. There's a number of factors there. The supply chain situation clearly put pressure on working capital in a number of ways. First of all, inventory purchase commitments, which while things are getting better, we did make significant purchase commitments over the course of the last 4 to 6 quarters during that time frame, so think that's going to keep some pressure. And we also, to be honest, had begun to alter our processes around demos so that we could – rather than putting new units into demo inventory, we sustain the life of our demo inventory so we could deliver products into the hands of our customers. And so, as we start to normalize that, rotate that demo back out and sell that equipment via our used equipment business, I think we'll be able to bring inventory over time – down over time. And then I think on the receivables side, what's really going to help us there is, as the supply chain situation continues to improve and we can really start to linearize our revenue delivery within the quarter, that will help. And I think there is room for continued improvement there over time.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And it was slight, but the CapEx guidance came down a touch. Just wondering what drove that?
Neil Dougherty: Well, similarly there, you think – the CapEx that you're seeing there is obviously the cash flow side of things. And again, with the supply chain situation, a lot of what we're seeing on the cash flow side is – were commitments that were made many months ago and to which we're starting to get delivery. We actually have seen our new commitments actually drop even further than what you've seen on the cash flow side of things as the supply chain situation is resolved. But we do expect CapEx cash flows to be high for the remainder of the year. Higher for the remainder of the year.
Adam Thalhimer: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. I want to go back to gross margins, and maybe if we can talk a little bit about some of the drivers of upside. I think there was reference to product mix, if we can just go back to that and unpack that. And I'm also curious whether there were any software license sales in there that may not recur on a go-forward basis? And then just one follow-up as well on orders, if you could talk about the linearity over the course of the quarter and how that trended by month, if possible? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Let me take the gross margin question, and then we'll have Mark address the orders question. I think on the gross margin side, again, on a year-over-year basis, it's primarily mix. And we do see a fair amount of movement in mix. Mix within the quarter can shift. But if you think about it in this particular situation, obviously, the shift towards higher recurring revenue is helping to the extent that those software revenues are sustained and stable in a period of time where revenues are – orders and revenue and demand for hardware is generally under pressure. I think that's a favorable shift on mix. And then probably even a bigger impact than that within the quarter is within the product shipments itself, it's skewed towards higher-end systems rather than lower end tools within the quarter is the best way to describe it. And particularly versus a year ago – versus prior quarters where we maybe have had an unfavorable mix shift towards high levels of [indiscernible] shipments, some of our lower-end products or things that can skew mix the other way. So, that's what we saw within quarter.
Mark Wallace: Yes. And Matt, as far as the order flow within the quarter, I would say it was very typical for a Q2 as the second period and the 6-month performance period, we saw it ramp throughout each of the 3 months. February is a shorter month, fewer selling days. As you get to the end of the performance period with our incentive comp and sales, we do expect a stronger finish, which is exactly what we saw. What I can say though was very consistent was the, kind of elevated level of customer engagement as customers prioritized on different programs that they felt were important going forward, and we saw that really is a stabilizing factor after coming out of Q1. So, we did see a ramp, but I wouldn't read anything more into that other than the natural seasonality of the Q2.
Matt Niknam: Got it. And just on the gross margins, any sort of abnormal software license sales in there to call out?
Neil Dougherty: No.
Matt Niknam : Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Good evening. Maybe a little bit of a strategy question. So, as you've grown your automotive and EV battery business, are there some attractive adjacencies there? Would you consider inorganic investments to, kind of round out the offering? Or do you feel that you have, kind of the solutions that you need to keep up the growth there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think as we mentioned, automotive has been a fairly new vertical expansion for us, one that we focused on since Keysight was formed, and we have successfully grown that to over $500 million. And we continue to see even more opportunity to expand as there's going to be ongoing innovations in EV and AV, not only in automobiles, but in other sectors as well, with the push for autonomous and electrification even in a broader set of industries. And we're continuing to build the most comprehensive portfolio all the way from design to silicon bring up to simulation, validation, compliance testing and manufacturing with more emphasis on R&D, really. And we're helping create standards, we're also working on finding new methodologies for testing that will be disruptive. And to that extent, we've made a small technology tuck-ins that have enhanced our software content and ability to make contributions to the workflow in this area. And we see, as we think about our M&A, we see a strong pipeline for opportunities and we'll continue to evaluate them against our strategic and financial hurdles, and we'll look to lean in for the right opportunity.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you for that. And then just a quick follow-up. How are your own lead times – as the supply chain has improved, how are your own lead times relative to pre-COVID history? Where do we stand on that? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So still improving. For a significant part of the portfolio, we're already back. There's another significant chunk that should work its way back to kind of pre-COVID lead times here over the third quarter. And then there will continue to be some outliers beyond that, but we're rapidly moving in the right direction.
David Ridley-Lane : Good to hear. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the call back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thanks Elisa, and thanks everyone, for joining us today. That concludes our call, and we look forward to seeing you at some of the upcoming conferences here in the quarter.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2023 Q1  (2023-02-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jason, and I’ll be your lead operator today.

And now, I’ll turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Keysight delivered exceptional first quarter financial results, posting revenue and earnings above the high end of our guidance against a backdrop of moderating demand. Our performance and consistent execution demonstrate the resilience of our business, and despite the challenging macro dynamics, we believe Keysight is well-positioned to build on our success and expand our leadership across our end-markets. I’ll focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, we achieved strong financial results. Revenue was a first quarter record and grew 14% on a core basis, driven by strength in both business segments and across all geographies. We again demonstrated the durability of our financial model and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share. Second, we started to see a normalization of what has been a robust and prolonged period of investment by our customers. Over the past two years, significant demand for Keysight’s solutions resulted in a 15% compound order growth rate and a book-to-bill of 1.09. As demand slows in the near-term, Keysight’s exposure to multiple end markets, its differentiated portfolio, and our strong operating discipline positions us well to weather the current macro dynamics. Third, we remain confident in the secular, long-term growth trends across our markets. Our software-centric solutions strategy is well-aligned with the needs of our customers, which we expect will enable us to outperform the market. We look forward to providing you a more comprehensive update on our long-term growth strategies and financial objectives at our upcoming Investor Day. Now let’s take a deeper look at our first quarter results. Orders declined 13% year-over-year against a strong compare of 22% growth in the last year’s first quarter. The slowing demand and business specific headwinds that we anticipated last quarter materialized largely as expected. These included the year-over-year impact of currency, our exit of Russia, and incremental China trade sanctions, which together contributed to a 6-point drag on the compare. We saw customers exercise caution in response to macroeconomic uncertainty. This was most notable among our largest customers in Commercial Communications, who were impacted by sharp demand decline in consumer electronics and computing segments. They are restructuring and reassessing their near-term priorities as the industry digests inventory, while at the same time maintaining investments across key, strategic programs. While the duration is difficult to predict, we expect these dynamics to weigh on our customers for at least the next couple of quarters. Despite macro challenges, revenue grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. Strong execution and operational discipline resulted in gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 30%, and earnings per share growth of 22%. Turning to our business segments. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group revenue grew 19% and delivered double-digit revenue growth for the 10th consecutive quarter, which underscores the diversity of our industry exposure. In automotive, we achieved record revenue and strong double-digit growth across all regions. Sales of electric vehicles continued to grow significantly in 2022, further fueling investment in EV and AV technologies and manufacturing. This quarter we secured multiple strategic wins with large OEMS and Tier 1 suppliers across a breadth of applications such as 5G, autonomous driving emulation, battery and charging infrastructure design, and in-vehicle networks. To strengthen our position in this market and capitalize on this growing, decades-long opportunity, we continue to expand our portfolio of solutions. An example is our current collaboration with Jiyun Technologies to develop a high-efficiency, compact battery test system to help accelerate the launch of new electric vehicles. In general electronics, double-digit revenue growth was driven by continued strength in emerging verticals such as digital health and IoT. We also secured wins in advanced research, as R&D investment remains robust in quantum, photonics, and Beyond 5G. Semiconductor solutions revenue growth was driven by continued fab investments in new wafer capacity and advanced nodes. While the inventory adjustments are pacing demand, foundries continue to execute their longer-term plans to globalize their production. We see significant opportunities in this market, and are investing in solutions for emerging semiconductor applications such as silicon photonics, high-power semis, and millimeter wave. Turning to our Communications Solutions Group, revenue grew 7%, with growth across both end markets and all regions. Commercial Communications revenue grew 11% on a core basis, to reach a record Q1, which was driven by ongoing, strategic investments in communications ecosystem. We saw strength in 5G R&D and deployments, Open-RAN, and datacenter networking, with increased focus on 800 gigabit and terabit communications solutions. These programs remain a priority and are driving demand for Keysight’s first-to-market solutions. As a trusted advisor, we remain actively engaged with our customers as they adapt to the current macro environment. We recently announced our collaboration with Qualcomm to accelerate 5G non-terrestrial network communications for broadband in remote areas, and enable device makers to speed development and verification of 3GPP Release 17 compliant designs. We continued to support the progression of standards and submitted the first 3GPP Release 16 protocol conformance test, enabling new use cases such as private and industrial networks, and autonomous vehicles. Investment in early 6G research is underway and Keysight joined forces with 16 organizations to create 6G-SANDBOX, a pan-European testbed for 6G experimentation and validation of 5G-Advanced and 6G capabilities. Nokia recently selected Keysight’s sub-Terahertz testbed to validate D band and E band technology to accelerate R&D critical to 5G-Advanced and 6G use cases in millimeter wave and sub-terahertz frequency spectrum. We also announced industry’s first and highest density network cybersecurity test platform, which provides data center network infrastructure and cloud providers with leading 400 gigabit Ethernet security validation capabilities. These solutions reinforce our leadership across wireless and wireline ecosystems. We are also looking forward to Mobile World Congress in Barcelona next week. Keysight will be engaged with many customers and industry leaders, and showcasing our solutions for advancing 5G standards including Release 17 and early research in 6G and intelligent automation. Turning to our government, defense, and aerospace business, record Q1 revenue grew 9% on a core basis, achieving its second highest revenue quarter driven by increased U.S. government spending, and strength in space and satellite, including new applications for non-terrestrial networks. We recently won a five-year contract with the U.S. Army who chose Keysight’s Field Fox handheld spectrum analyzer for field use. We expect U.S. government budget appropriations to ramp spending in new programs in the second half of this year. We also anticipate an increase in defense budgets worldwide, and growing investment in new technologies such as 5G, space and satellite, quantum, and advanced research. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to expand our software capabilities. We recently completed the acquisition of Cliosoft, whose data and IP management software tools enhance our portfolio of electronic design automation solutions. In addition, Eggplant’s test automation platform was recently recognized as a leader by The Forrester Wave. About one-third of total revenue, the growing mix of software and services is integral to the durability of our financial model. Keysight’s differentiation is a function of our software-centric solutions strategy, collaboration with our customers, and investments we are making to ensure that we address the most challenging technology needs of today, and into the future. We are prioritizing high-conviction growth opportunities to solidify our competitive position for the long-term, while at the same time accelerating initiatives to drive further efficiencies consistent with our financial model. We remain committed to creating long-term value for business stakeholders, and positively impacting the global community. I’m proud that Keysight has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth year in a row. I’d like to thank all our Keysight employees for their dedication and relentless execution, which drives our strong track record of performance and is a testament to Keysight’s Leadership Model, our values, and to our people. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a strong quarter and a solid start to the year. We delivered revenue of $1,381 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10%, or 14% on a core basis. As we anticipated, macroeconomic uncertainty moderated demand in the first quarter. Orders of $1.3 billion were down 13%, or 10% on a core basis. Even with revenue outpacing orders by $80 million, we ended the quarter with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $492 million, resulting in operating margin of 30%. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.02 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated revenue of $939 million, up 7%, or 10% on a core basis. Commercial Communications revenue of $629 million was up 8%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $310 million benefited from increased U.S. government spending, which we believe will continue to ramp through FY23. Altogether, CSG delivered record gross margin of 67%, and operating margin of 29%. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $442 million, up 19%, or 23% on a core basis, with double-digit revenue growth in automotive and general electronics, demonstrating the diversity of our markets. Growth was strongest in the Americas and Europe. EISG reported gross margin of 61%, and operating margin of 32%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $366 million, and free cash flow of $306 million, or 22% of revenue. Shares repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 700,000 shares at an average share price of $176, for a total consideration of $125 million. Now, turning to our outlook. We’re navigating the same evolving macro and industry dynamics that others have noted. As Satish mentioned, we expect it will take at least a couple of quarters for customers to work through their near-term challenges. If the current demand environment persists through our fourth quarter, we would expect to deliver low single-digit revenue and earnings per share growth for the year, achieved through steady backlog conversion, strong cost discipline, and the flexibility of our financial model. Turning to our second quarter guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $1,370 million to $1,390 million, and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.91 to $1.97, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 179 million shares. While near-term uncertainties are moderating the demand environment, Keysight’s secular, long-term growth trends remain intact. Our differentiated, first-to-market solutions, durability of our financial model, steady cash generation, and strong balance sheet position us well to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing more with you about the compounding nature of our business at our upcoming Investor Day. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Neil. Jason, can you give the instructions for the Q&A, please?
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the question. I was hoping, first, if you could elaborate a little bit more on the comments on orders. It seems like it’s particularly impacting the Commercial Communications business and maybe certain other areas are doing a bit better. But if you could offer a bit more on where you’re seeing the orders and where perhaps you’re seeing some moderation from customers?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi Mark. What we’ll do -- first, I want to start by saying our customer engagements remain very strong, robust shipment activity this quarter, and you see that reflected in the strong revenue performance. Second, our backlog is still at $2.5 billion, high-quality, low cancellations to date. And to put this demand normalization in context, I would just point to two things. First, as we said in the last earnings call, we have some business-specific headwinds, roughly 6 to 7 points, that played out. And this quarter, our comps from a year ago, we were up 22%. So putting those things in context, a little bit more deep dive I’ll provide on the end markets could be helpful. In Commercial Communications, we saw the top customer pull back, especially in the wireless part of the business, due to the macro challenges and the inventory digestion that they were going through, especially with regard to the smartphone industry. We also saw equally the activity system pickup on the wireline side as customers are investing in 400 gig and 800 gig Ethernet and terabit and beyond. So, those investments remain strong. In our aerospace and defense business, we’re starting to see a favorable uptick in the U.S. business as budgets are passed and program spends get unlocked. It’s also important to note that the -- that all of the prime contractors had stronger backlog positions, which also gives us a good outlook as we look ahead. And our Industrial business continues to show resilience with the research spend occurring in different countries around the world, automotive with EV and AV and next-gen semi investments remaining strong as well. So, we put all of this in context and say, we remain confident in the portfolio differentiation we have and we’re actively engaged with our customers, which will enable us to outperform this environment.
Mark Delaney: Thanks, Satish. That’s very helpful. My other question was on the cost controls, and the Company spoke about being disciplined. Were you alluding more to the variable nature of your cost structure, and that will moderate spending depending on what demand ultimately does this year, or are there more specific steps that Keysight is planning to take on cost controls? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Mark, as we mentioned, always that we have this variable cost structure and operating model, that’s the first leg of our resilience from a financial perspective. But we’re always looking for dynamic resource allocation opportunities, especially in a market like this, where we see some of our customers pull back. We redeploy to other customers who need these technologies so that we’re maximizing. So that’s part of that discipline that I referenced. And we always have on deck operational efficiency programs as part of the Keysight leadership model. And we’re remaining focused on that, in some cases, even accelerating that. That should help us offset the inflationary impacts to the P&L as we are all faced with right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: I want to go back to booking a backlog. You guys have been very clear for a couple of quarters that post-COVID we’re going to have to go through a backlog normalization. And I want to get some more color from you is, is there any way you can separate or differentiate the backlog normalization from end market demand weakness, especially in the smartphone area that you highlighted?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Maybe I’ll just start, and then Neil can add. I’d say that if we look at our end markets and if you take a look at the commercial comps, especially in the wireless side, the top customer pull back is definitely macro related and related to the inventory exposure that they have, which has been widely talked about. But if we look at the base customer spend, it remains pretty strong. So, that’s as far as that end market is concerned, but we start to look at aerospace defense and our industrial exposure, which continues to provide us top line diversity. And I think that will play out as we go through the year as well. Neil, specific to our backlog position?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is maybe starting with the supply chain, we still have areas where we are supply chain constrained. But in other areas, we’ve seen a pretty rapid improvement in terms of availability of product and kind of the trend towards normalization of lead times. And so what we are seeing, and I’ve talked about this is something we expected. In many cases, we have products for the -- or customers for those products that have scheduled shipments now out an additional quarter and beyond. And as our lead times have come in, they don’t now, at this time, need to place new orders until they get delivery of the product that’s already sitting in backlog. And so, the -- if you’re around 6 or 8 months, there was this tendency to place orders early to get in line to adjust for those long lead times. Now that we’re seeing lead times normalize and coupled with macro uncertainty, there’s no longer that incentive to get in line early and that is creating a little bit of additional pressure on the order line.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. And just a follow-up here. You did $1.3 billion of new orders. Is there any way we could think about the R&D portion of that order or the strategic investment that were reflected in the $1.3 billion from production? And I’m just trying to better understand how we should think about the downside risk in booking activity from here? Is there like a -- is $800 million a quarter the worst-case scenario, or anything in that nature that you can offer would be very helpful.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. Again, it remains a highly uncertain environment as you know. What we’re seeing is customers typically firm up demand and budgets at the beginning of the year because of the concerns they have, they’re pushing out those decisions to later in the year. So, the uncertainty definitely remains. But as we look at the spending environment, especially even in commercial comms, we see more pullback around manufacturing expansions relative to the R&D plans of customers. So that’s generally the trend. And if you look in the ISG business, I’ll say, in the semiconductor as an example, customers are not pulling back on next-gen semi capacity, right, whether it’s 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, they’re actually maybe cutting back on some of the 7-nanometer work they were planning on. So, the focus on next generation remains very strong. I may -- I will ask Mark to provide some color on the customer dynamics that he’s seeing in the -- from a sales perspective.
Mark Wallace: Yes. And I would -- Mehdi, I would -- just to directly answer your question, the mix during the quarter was still very predominant R&D. And Satish mentioned, the pullback was much less there and especially in commercial comms than it was on the manufacturing side. The other factor that we’ve talked about in the past on other conference calls is our funnel. We have a six-month funnel that gives us a strong indication of the forward-looking demand. That has been factored into our guide. It has normalized with the effects that we saw pretty acutely here in the first quarter. And looking out six months, the demand signal looks to be fairly consistent, in line with what we saw in Q1.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, the other point with regard to your comment on the downside risk, right? I’ll say that we’ve done a lot of work to enter into more of the R&D markets of our customers. That still remains a priority for us. We’ve also done quite a bit of work to diversify this business to expand into industrial end markets, aerospace defense and auto in particular. And finally, through our sales footprint, we’ve done work to attract new customers, and that remains a critical priority for us, and we -- which I remain confident that all of these actions will enable us to outperform in this environment as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.
Meta Marshall: Just a couple of questions. I mean, maybe you spoke to kind of Open-RAN millimeter wave and kind of some areas of investment. I guess as we think about the communications business, could you just give us a sense of like what are the strongest revenue driver is growing in - moving into kind of calendar year 2023? Is it Open-RAN? Is the millimeter wave? Is it 6G? Just kind of some -- what is the general strength of that business coming from? And then, maybe as a follow-up question, you guys mentioned some kind of cost discipline, stronger cost discipline that you are balancing out kind of the lower demand indications from. But just a sense of where investments are still being made, just what degree of those cuts are we kind of talking about as we move throughout the year? Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Meta, thank you. So first of all, we remain intensely focused on continuing to innovate and strengthen our portfolio. So from an R&D perspective, the collaborations we have with our customers informs where we invest, and we feel pretty good about it. At best, some of these pullbacks are short-term delays for R&D spend, and we expect those to recover as our customer deals with these inventory dynamics that we mentioned. With regard to 5G, I think I would say that the R&D roadmap remains in place, right? Our customers have a multiyear roadmap, and they continue to invest to realize that roadmap. And at the big picture level, I would say while substantial progress has been made in terms of 5G deployments, we still have about roughly 1 billion subscribers in the world, and the roadmap is to take it from $1 billion to $5 billion in the next five years or so. So clearly, there’s more deployment activity occurring that’s in front of us with India and other parts of the world leading that effort. The standards progression, which really is a basis for R&D business with Release 16 and Release 17, moving into Release 18, which will be 5G advanced, is pretty strong. And those innovation vectors around non-terrestrial networks, new features such as RedCap for IoT applications -- proliferation of 5G into new verticals remains areas of opportunity for us that we’re investing in to continue to differentiate along with Open-RAN as well, which we have talked about. But the industry roadmap remains solid, and our differentiation remains strong in these markets.
Neil Dougherty: And then, Meta, I’ll just address the cost discipline question. So, first and foremost, I’d like to just emphasize that we are continuing growth-oriented investments that are going to drive this business forward in the future. We’re very clear about what those priorities are internally and we’re keeping our foot on the gas with regard to our most important growth-driven investments. That being said, I like the way Satish characterized it, right? We always have onset a tap of efficiency gains that we’re looking to that we’re looking to operate on as part of our continuous improvement culture. And given the environment that we’re in with pressure on the top line, coupled with not just inflation, frankly, but signs that the dollar is going to backtrack on some of the strengthening that we saw last year, which will also put pressure on our foreign currency spending. We felt it was prudent for us to take actions to accelerate some of that efficiency. So, it’s across the P&L, but we are not putting future growth investments at risk.
Operator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I guess if I can just start with orders. And if you can comment on the linearity of orders through the quarter based on your expectations for seeing some of this digestion from customers for another couple of quarters, so just you had more deterioration maybe as you exit the quarter. But just wanted to check if sort of what’s the trend through the month in the quarter that you saw. And the comment that you made about electronics orders holding up better than communication overall. Now, I hate to sort of generalize EISG overall, but it’s seems a bit counterintuitive because my impression was that communication is a bit more R&D aligned for you than EISG in general. But maybe if you can sort of correct me there or why -- explain why that’s happening if R&D is most protected? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Samik, this is Mark. I’ll take the first question on linearity of orders. And it was -- we had about two-thirds of our orders after the second month. We had a big finish to the end of FY22 and our fourth quarter. So, we had a nice rebound in December and the last quarter was about 34% of the total orders of bookings for the quarter. So, it was a pretty linear flow of business. On the electronic industrial side, what we see, as Satish mentioned, is continued demand around next-generation process technologies for our semiconductor business, very long-term secular growth drivers that we’ve been talking about for a long time. The activity level and focus around the next-generation auto, EV in particular, is continuing to ramp. Again, this is a decade-long transformation. The number of EVs sold last year as opposed to ICE vehicles continues to grow. So, I see this as a long-term trend. And what I was particularly surprised with was how our general electronics business held up, particularly around some of the verticals that we’re focused on, digital health care, advanced research and education. Obviously, some of this is exposed to broader GDP kind of markets, and we saw the PMI stay below 54. I think it was five or six months in a row. But in general, the three segments below EISG continued to show resilience and, overall, continued investments in these next-generation technologies.
Samik Chatterjee: For my follow-up and maybe to just change gears here a bit, there’s a competitor of yours who is going through a strategic review process with interest from multiple parties for an acquisition. I’m not asking you to comment on the interest in that company in itself. But how should we think about benefits to Keysight from scaling the business in a step function from here on? And the level of -- leverage -- debt leverage on the balance sheet you would be comfortable with if attractive opportunities did come through that are more visible?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Samik. I’d say you’re right. We don’t comment on any specific opportunity. I would just say that we remain confident in the business that we run, its cash generation potential. You’ve seen the strong free cash flow performance of the business. And so congruent with that, we have a consistent capital allocation discipline, which is around organic growth and M&A where it makes sense and return of capital. And with regard to M&A, you’ve seen us be incredibly patient and disciplined with regard to the opportunities we pursue. We look at hundreds of companies after having done market assessments on them. And then we’ve done about 20 to date. And we’ve been -- and we’ve done them with a view of the strategy and what scale that we can bring to the target and how we see the -- first, the strategic fed, but second and equally important is the return to our shareholders. So, I think those hurdles will continue to remain in place, and we remain very disciplined.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS.
Christ Snyder: So back on the conference call in November, the Company talked about book-to-bills approaching a more normalized 1.0x. The quarter came in a bit below that at 0.94. So, were orders in the quarter softer than you would have expected back in November? Or [Technical Difficulty] for book-to-bills to improve as the year goes on and kind of reach that more normalized average of 1.0x for the full year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, if you go back to the November quarter, we talked about 8 points of specific headwinds that we were facing from currency and from China, Russia, those things, and that we expected that we were also recognizing macro on -- softness on top of that or anticipating macro softness on top of that. So, by and large, I’d say the quarter came in largely in line with our expectations. It’s obviously hard to put a quantification on macro. I mean, looking forward, as Satish has said, it’s very difficult to call at this point. We’ve attempted to give you some parameters with which to think about the business. Mark has commented that in our funnel, which looks out over the next couple of quarters would indicate demand that’s more or less in line with what we just saw in the first quarter. And then, I did state in my prepared comments that if that kind of order trend remain in place for our entire remainder of our fiscal year, we’d expect to still be able to deliver a low single-digit revenue and EPS growth. So, we’re taking it one quarter at a time, but that should hopefully give you some guardrails with which to think about the business.
Christ Snyder: Thank you. I appreciate that. And then just kind of staying on orders for fiscal Q1, is there anything or color you could provide around how orders in China did during the quarter, given a lot of the disruption over there? And also government and defense business orders, just given some of the budgeting resolution processes going on? Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Sure. This is Mark. I’ll comment on both of those. So we faced, as everyone did, the unanticipated breakout from COVID, and there were some incremental trade restrictions that happened in the month of December. We did see orders decline in China. They actually increased sequentially. So, that kind of indicates the unusual seasonality that we faced. But it was -- relative to what we were expecting to face with some of the declines, I was pleased with our response. And it really continues to be in line with what we’ve talked about in the past, which is our ability to pivot to new opportunities and the breadth of our customer base in China, which continues to be an area of strength for us. And that includes automotive, where the business was up. Some of the private networks, which is a new use case for 5G from an industrial standpoint, continue to show signs of growth for us. Mature process technologies for semiconductor. So, as we go forward and the economy begins to normalize there and maybe reopen into the second half, we’ll keep a close eye on that as well. Aerospace defense, as Satish noted in his opening comments and otherwise, we saw a strong growth -- order growth, in the U.S. That’s a direct byproduct of the budget being approved much earlier this year than last year. And what we see happen in Q1 was not new program starts, but rather multiyear programs that were stalled because of continuing resolution turn back on and some of that spend continue to flow. So, as we get through the next several months and quarters, and the record high RDT&E budget flows through the process, we hope to see some additional tailwinds there. Outside the U.S., with the geopolitical situation, we expect to see continued long-term demand for defense modernization. So, we’re positioned well to capture that as well.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Just maybe to add a comment to Mark, the space and satellite also continues to inflect for us in the aerospace defense business, and is showing some momentum there with customers, too.
Operator: Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.
Aaron Rakers: I’m going to go back to kind of the order and backlog dynamics. Neil, I think last quarter, you had mentioned that you were maybe about four or five weeks of kind of inflated or elevated backlog relative to normal. I’m curious where that stands right now? And does your low single-digit assumption assume -- growth-wise assume kind of back to normalized backlog levels through the course of the year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. It’s a great question. So obviously, revenue outpaced orders by about $80 million within the quarter. You can do the math on it. But if we see a similar environment persist for the remainder of the year, which is, again, in line with the guardrails what I put out there, we’d burn $300 million plus of that kind of abnormal backlog. So, it may not get us all the way home, but it would get us a significant chunk of the way towards normalization of the backlog over a multi-quarter period. We always knew it would take multiple quarters to normalize the backlog. And while this is just one scenario, I think it’s not out of line with our expectations.
Aaron Rakers: Okay. And that’s helpful. And then, a quick follow-up. Just on the semiconductor business, you continue to perform well. And I don’t know the answer to this question, but I’ll just put it out there, is that -- is there any kind of disruptions? I think there’s been a supplier in the semiconductor supply chain that had seen, I think, some cyber attack issues. Is that at all impactful to your business or not?
Satish Dhanasekaran: No, not at all. For us, we serve the wafer stage, which is on the front end. It takes a longer lead time from our fabs to put capacity. And we see customers sticking with their plans for 5-nanometer and below. And equally, we’re also quite pleased with the progression we’re making to further add more applications into our solution stat, whether it is high-power applications for certain chips or silicon photonics or millimeter wave. So we continue to build that portfolio out.
Operator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: The first part of my question is, Neil, you made the question that are the statement as the year plays out, if it does according to plan, you’re looking at kind of sales growth. I think I heard you say low mid-single digits, and then you said -- and EPS growth. Did you mean the EPS growth to be positive or like in that same range of sales growth? Because typically, earnings per share grows at a bigger or a magnitude about sales growth. Then I’ll have a follow-up. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So what I said, first of all, we weren’t guiding the year. What we said is, it’s a highly uncertain environment, it’s difficult to know. But if the demand stays consistent with where -- what we saw in Q1 through the remainder of our year, we would expect to deliver in that scenario low single-digit revenue and low single-digit EPS growth. Obviously, our model calls for higher revenue growth than that with 40% operating leverage, which enables us to get to double-digit EPS growth. So, in a scenario where revenues are growing at a lower level, coupled with this inflationary environment, which is a bit abnormal, we’d be looking at low singles for both revenue and EPS. Again, under that specific scenario where our orders remain more or less in line with what we saw in the first quarter.
Jim Suva: Great. And then my follow-up question is, I believe it was in the month of December that had the incremental trade restrictions against China. I think that’s right. And so when we think about your commentary for 2023, if things are consistent, how much of sales impact is that incremental restrictions? Is that what you’re referring to in your prepared commentary about the kind of 3 to 4 points -- or 6 to 7 points of growth impact, or can you just help me flesh out the impact of the trade restrictions? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: So, the new China trade restrictions that came about in December is an additional 1 to 2 points of headwind for us over the longer term. The comment about 6 to 7 was -- on the call last quarter, I outlined what at the time we thought was going to be 8 points of headwind coming from China, Russia and FX. As we got to the end of the quarter, what we thought was going to be 8 was more like 6.5, so call it 6 to 7, and that’s largely because the dollar backed up a little bit. So, the FX impact was less than originally expected. The China impact was slightly less as well.
Operator: Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam: Maybe just a follow-up on that last one. On the Analyst Day, I’m just wondering any initial thoughts on what we could expect on March 7th in terms of just updates to longer-term targets? And then just on the M&A backdrop, I’m just wondering, what’s the latest you’re seeing in terms of opportunities and valuations. And I know in the past you’ve been focused on some smaller size software deals. I’m just wondering if that’s still the focus or maybe whether you’re open to larger deals, just considering the pullback in private market valuations. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I look forward to sharing the forward-looking view on the market fundamentally at the Investor Day. Across our end markets, we have -- we see innovation accelerating. And I think we’ll lay out Keysight’s strategy to go into set those exciting long-term opportunities. So that’s number one. But I think with regard to M&A, clearly, if you look at how we’ve grown, we’ve been disciplined in actioning M&A of all sizes. You’ve seen us do Anite and Ixia, slightly larger scale and then a lot of technology tuck-ins, which have helped us complete the workflow and actually create greater value for customers and also expand our margins in the process. So from that perspective, we remain active in exploring new markets and targets as well. But again, as I mentioned before, we have strong strategic and financial hurdles that we have to meet as gates before we go ahead and transact the business. On the valuation front, on the margin, we think the valuations are likely to come in as more of the market reality sets in with a number of the firms, so. And with the strong balance sheet and cash position, we remain active in exploring opportunities.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Congrats on the Q1 beat. First question on cancellations. You said that they’ve been low to date. I guess I just wanted to gauge your level of concern that that could get worse.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We’ve had no increase in our cancellation rate. So we continue to believe the quality of our backlog is very high.
Adam Thalhimer: And then I guess I’m just curious, how does this downturn and what you’re seeing so far compare to prior downturns? Because amazingly, you guys have been public almost 10 years, but we haven’t had a prolonged recession during that period.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think I’ll take this. Satish here. Every recession, the environment is different. And I would say that after having a couple of very strong growth years, some normalization was inevitable. And what we’re seeing is pull back from some of the customers in response to some of the inventory excesses in specific markets. But I go back to our portfolio position is the strongest it’s ever been because of our emphasis on solutions. Our business model today is much stronger because we have -- over 33% of our business is software and services, which gives us additional resilience. And we have a strong operating model at the Company that allows us to tide over some perturbations in the marketplace. And we also enter the year with a strong backlog position as well. So from those perspectives, it’s different. I also think if you look at the gross margin at the Company level, we continue to stay strong at 65%. And I think with the operational model in place, we remain confident about our ability to demonstrate that resilience.
Operator: Our next question is from Rob Mason with Baird.
Rob Mason: Satish, frankly, I’ll follow up your comment with a question just around the software orders in the quarter. I kind of inferred that they remain resilient. But as you think about where you’ve seen some challenges in Commercial Communications, to the extent that there’s a slowdown in renewals, or is that something that hits your radar screen as you see some of the headcount reductions take place in the tech sector? Just how you defend against that?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think we have an incredibly sticky business with our customers, and we’re not seeing them pull back on renewals. Obviously, new purchases are taking longer, as Mark alluded to earlier. But I think even in the Commercial Communications sector, we have two businesses, right, wireless and wireline. We’re seeing stronger pullback from customers in the wireless side of the equation. The wireline customers continue to innovate. You see some of the trends in data center and cloud that are playing out. Need for faster data rates is important. Also in lieu of all of the activity that’s going on around AI, there’s a greater need to optimize the workflows of our customers. So, that part of the opportunity continues to remain stronger on a relative basis. I’ll just have Mark make any comment on...
Mark Wallace: Yes. Rob, just to answer -- yes, that was -- Satish did a great job. And I’ll just let you know we didn’t see the pullback in software like we did in other parts of the business. As a matter of fact, our renewals were up and our growth from subscriptions and enterprise agreements remained steady, which is what you would expect from a sticky business, something that has kind of a continuous flow of value in a subscription model. So that really worked for us this quarter.
Rob Mason: Sure. Sure. Is that -- maybe just as a follow-on question, is that the influence that -- there seems to certainly be maybe a trend with -- two quarters, two years make a trend, where the first quarter gross margin is a good bit stronger in the Commercial Communications segment and then maybe steps down, moderates in the second quarter. Is that still the expectation or the dynamic at play there?
Neil Dougherty: Could you repeat that? I’m sorry.
Rob Mason: Yes. Just essentially, your communications -- CSG group gross margins tends to have a much stronger first quarter gross margin, at least going by the last couple of years, than it does the remainder of the year. Is that -- would that be the expectation this year as well?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I don’t think you can draw any conclusions looking at historical sequential gross margin data as to what to expect. At least as I would think about it, any perturbations that may have appeared to have repeated have to be more coincidental than systematic.
Operator: And our final question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: The typical seasonality is for a nice sequential uptick in EISG in the second quarter. Lot of the commentary on the call has been that ESG remains pretty strong. I mean, within your second quarter guidance, should we expect kind of that historical sequential pattern in EISG?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean all I would say is our sequential guide right now takes a look at our large backlog, looks at the schedule of shipments, looks at the incoming funnel. And obviously, we’re going to rely on a portion of incoming orders to turn into revenue within the quarter. And so. we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to deliver to the number that we’ve put out.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then also IE -- on EISG, excuse me. The trend in gross margin has been a little bit softer over the last couple of quarters. Is there -- that being said, margin expansion -- operating margin expansion has continued to be quite good. But I’m just wondering, is there something in the mix or other dynamics that you could call out to sort of explain that gross margin trend there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Across the businesses, we’re obviously looking to create value for our customers and that value expectations go up with time, greater solutions, content, greater -- software obviously increases the gross margin. You see that in our CSG business, 67% gross margin. So, we’ll continue to drive that up. On the EISG business, slightly lower software content, higher mix of manufacturing offerings traditionally. But equally, our emphasis on creating solutions is not diminished. We’re in fact, adding more software content, even to our semi manufacturing test systems, we’re providing more analytics capabilities, and we have strong customer uptake for those. So, over time, as we come off this inflationary impacts of the supply chain and other things that we’ve talked about, I would continue to expect more margin upside and look forward to sharing some of that with you at the Investor Day.
Operator: There are no more questions, so I’ll pass the call back over to the management team for closing remarks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, and thank you all for joining. Keysight delivered another strong quarter, revenue up 10%, strong gross margins at 65%, operating profit 30%, free cash flow of greater than $300 million. And we continue to remain focused on actively collaborating with our customer -- customers across the multiple end markets we serve as they navigate these dynamic conditions, which gives us the confidence in our ability to outperform. Again, we have a diversified end market exposure, strong solutions portfolio that’s growing, strength of backlog, strong cash position and a strong balance sheet. And all of these enable us to invest to realize our long-term growth strategies. But we’re doing so with the fiscal discipline and prudent operational initiatives that we have in place. We look forward to seeing you all in New York on March 7th. And I’m excited to share the future growth strategy moving forward. Thank you.
Operator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.

===== 2022 Q4  (2022-11-17 17:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Dante, and I will be your lead operator today. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 17, 2022, at 2:00 PM Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone to Keysight's fourth quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2022. Joining me are Keysight's President and CEO, Satish Dhanasekaran; and our CFO, Neil Dougherty. In the Q&A session, will be joined by Senior Vice President of Global Sales and Chief Customer Officer, Mark Wallace. You can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.keysight.com under the Financial Information tab and quarterly reports. Today's comments by Satish and Neil will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make reference to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency movements and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. The most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations are on our website, and all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company on today's call. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. We assume no obligation to update them. Please review our recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of these risks and other factors. Lastly, management is scheduled to participate in upcoming investor conferences hosted by Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. We hope to see many of you there. And now, I will turn the call over to Satish.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight reported strong fourth quarter results, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and drove a strong finish to the year. Before we get into the quarter, I want to highlight our exceptional performance for fiscal year, which illustrates continued progress we're making in transforming the Company to a software-centric solutions provider. We set new records for orders, which grew 12% to $6 billion, a new record for revenue, which was up 10%, and a new record for earnings per share, which increased 22%, all the while returning capital through $849 million in share repurchases or 89% of free cash flow. In addition, we continue to invest in next-generation technologies for long-term differentiation and see a high level of engagement and activity with our customers around their future needs. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered an all-time record revenue and earnings per share in the fourth quarter ahead of expectations enabled by outstanding execution by Keysight teams who successfully navigated supply chain, geopolitical and macro dynamics. Second, we achieved record orders of $1.6 billion with steady bookings throughout the quarter and a book-to-bill of 1.09. While our customers' multiyear road maps remain unchanged, they are exercising more caution given the macro backdrop, which we anticipate will moderate demand in the near term. Third, as we enter fiscal '23, we remain confident in our ability to outperform the market based on the differentiation of our solutions, our strong R&D customer value proposition and the robust backlog position we have entering the year. And as we look longer term, the secular innovation trends in our end markets remain strong. Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of the fourth quarter. Record orders of $1.6 billion grew 9% on a core basis. Record revenue grew 15% on a core basis, with solid growth across all regions as Keysight team successfully navigated challenging dynamics. This resulted in record quarterly earnings of $2.14 per share. The strength and resiliency of our business model is due to our strategic efforts to diversify our industry exposure. This has been best exemplified in the growth of our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group and our ability to leverage our industry-leading first-to-market solutions to enable expansion across the broader communications ecosystem. EISG achieved its ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Auto, semiconductor solutions and general electronics all achieved record quarterly revenue. For the year, both orders and revenues set new records as we capitalize on continued investments across all three EISG markets. In automotive, we're pleased with the continued adoption of our solutions portfolio as orders grew double digits for the seventh consecutive quarter and exceeded $500 million this year. Automotive OEMs and their suppliers continue to focus on strategic new mobility investments, which drove key wins for Keysight. In addition, automotive-focused semiconductor companies continue to add capabilities to support EV and AV applications, which we view as a favorable long-term dynamic. We recently announced the Scienlab DC Emulator, which enables customers to accurately characterize high-voltage, high-power electric vehicle battery performance under varying real-world charging conditions. And Keysight's PathWave Lab's operation software won 2022 AutoTech Breakthrough Award for overall electric vehicle technology. In support of AV applications, silicon designers are exploring adoption of commercial standards such as MIPI for automotive and other surround sensor applications, including cameras and in-vehicle infotainment displays. We are now expanding our leading compliance test solutions to offer advanced verification and diagnostic capabilities for automotive designers. Turning to our semiconductor solutions business. Q4 was the tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit order book and a record revenue quarter. We saw sustained demand for our wafer test solutions and precision positioning capabilities, which enable the realization of advanced process nodes. In addition, Keysight has continued to partner with industry leaders, Synopsys and Ansys, on RF and millimeter wave integrated circuit design flows built for today's wireless communication requirements, including 5G and 6G system-on-chips. Keysight received a Partner of the Year Award from TSMC for joint development design flows in RF and millimeter wave nodes. In general electronics, record orders grew double digits this quarter as demand remains strong and broad-based across industrial IoT and digital health as well as education and advanced research markets. Turning to Communication Solutions Group. The business delivered strong orders and record revenue. Annual orders and revenue were all-time highs despite geopolitical headwinds and delays in U.S. Defense budget appropriations. Commercial communications revenue grew 10% and 11% for the year, with growth across all regions. Investments across communications ecosystem continued throughout the year with sustained spending in next-generation wireless and wireline technologies. Ongoing investments in 5G standards, new spectrum growing deployments around the world and steady evolution from 400 gig to 800 gig to terabit Ethernet drove growth. We ended a record year for 5G orders as Keysight's market-leading solutions continue to provide industry with new capabilities needed for development of next-generation devices as well as wireless and wireline networks. Examples that highlight our portfolio's alignment with key industry priority include a recent partnership with IBM to integrate our Open RAN capabilities into their cloud automation tools to accelerate network deployments. We also completed the validation of our first 5G location-based service use case from Global Certification Forum by combining the testing of 5G new radio and global navigation satellite system technologies into a single platform. Lastly, in collaboration with key silicon and data center partners, we enabled the industry's first 1.6 terabit transmission and data center interconnect, leveraging our high-speed digital solutions. Aerospace, defense and government business revenue grew 4% for the quarter and 3% for the year, setting a new record while navigating geopolitical headwinds. Steady investments in spectrum operations, cybersecurity and space and satellite drove demand. 5G continued to expand in aerospace and defense end markets, and we saw increasing investment in advanced research. Proposed increases in investment in the U.S. and allied countries for modernization of defense capabilities and new satellite and space applications position us well for future opportunities. As an integral part of our solution strategy, software and services order and revenue growth this year continued to outpace Keysight overall, which has driven our annual recurring revenue to approximately $1.2 billion. Software and services again represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. Keysight's focus on customer success and innovation is driving our development of first-to-market, high-value solutions. Our achievements over the years exemplify Keysight's collaborative culture and our talented workforce, and we are honored that Keysight has placed tenth on the Fortune's Best Workplaces in Technology list for 2022. We believe our differentiated culture gives us a unique ability to recruit and develop capable talent and will be our sustaining competitive advantage. In conclusion, I would like to thank our employees for all their contributions, commitment and strong track record of execution. In the midst of an uncertain economic environment, we remain confident in the resilience of our business, the strength of our balance sheet and the flexibility of our operating model. Now, I'll turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. We delivered an outstanding fourth quarter of 2022 with record revenue of $1.443 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 15% on a core basis. Our strategies to navigate the ongoing supply constraints continue to be effective. While the supply chain situation improved within the quarter, it continues to moderate our near-term revenue expectations. Record orders of $1.570 billion increased 5% or 9% on a core basis, and we entered fiscal year 2023 with over $2.5 billion in backlog. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 64%, which, as expected, was down 80 basis points sequentially due to inflationary pressures and increased shipments of lower-end instruments, enabled by the improving supply chain. Operating expenses of $494 million were well managed, and we generated operating margin of 30%. Net income was a record $386 million, and we achieved $2.14 in earnings per share, which was $0.14 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 180 million shares. Foreign exchange impact on our earnings was negligible, thanks to a full natural hedge provided by our global footprint, which was then supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments. The Communications Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $992 million, up 8% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%. Commercial communications generated revenue of $681 million in the fourth quarter, up 10% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, increasing O-RAN adoption and investment in 800 gigabit and 1.6 terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $311 million, up 4%, driven by double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved record revenue of $451 million, up 20% or 25% on a core basis, driven by strength across all markets. EISG reported gross margin of 60% and operating margin of 32%. Turning to our full year financial performance. Keysight delivered outstanding results in 2022 despite ongoing supply constraints, foreign exchange headwinds and incremental trade restrictions. FY '22 revenue totaled $5.4 billion, up 10% year-over-year or 12% on a core basis. Gross margin was flat at 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation. We invested $813 million in R&D, while operating margin improved 140 basis points to 29%. FY '22 non-GAAP net income was $1.4 billion or $7.63 per share, up 22%. Moving on to balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with more than $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $398 million and free cash flow of $340 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $959 million, representing 18% of revenue and 69% of non-GAAP net income. Share repurchases this quarter totaled approximately 800,000 shares at an average price per share of $158.77 for a total consideration of $126 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 5.4 million shares at an average share price of $156.09 for a total consideration of $849 million or 89% of free cash flow. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We exit the year with record backlog and confidence in Keysight's ability to continue executing through near-term uncertainties. As a result, we expect first quarter 2023 revenue to be in the range of $1.360 billion to $1.380 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.87 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. A few modeling reminders as we enter the year. Our annual compensation cycle is administered in Q1. And in this current inflationary environment, we expect our second consecutive year of wage increases above our historic average. We are targeting FY '23 R&D investment at approximately 16% of revenue. Annual interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million, and we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '23. In closing, we recognize the uncertainty of the current macro environment, and we'll continue to be disciplined. Keysight's highly flexible cost structure, track record of execution, diverse end markets and long-term secular growth drivers give us confidence in our ability to outperform the market. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. That concludes our formal remarks. Dante, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee.
Angela Zhang: This is Angela Zhang on for Samik Chatterjee. Congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. My first question is sort of related to what you mentioned briefly in the prepared remarks on sort of macro slowdown and perhaps some pullbacks. I'd like to dig in a little more there. Given that we've seen commentary from other companies indicating that there's a pullback in telco CapEx, are you seeing any impact on their R&D budget? And then I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Angela. Yes, we're very pleased with the quarter. And in consideration of this environment, pretty strong results and also a strong finish to the year. And as I stated, we saw a steady level of spend from a demand perspective through the quarter. All our regions from a sales perspective grew. So it was broad-based. And going into a little bit on the end market color, I would say 5G continues to remain strong. We grew our 5G orders double-digit, strength in R&D. And also with the inflections that we're seeing in deployments around some parts of the world, even some of the manufacturing spend there remains strong for us this quarter. And we did see pockets of weakness in the broad component ecosystem, and that was an area we obviously watch carefully, and that is related to the smartphone demand. And if you look at the cloud and data center markets in wireline, while some of the cloud -- direct cloud spend from cloud providers was pushed out -- service providers was pushed out, the broad spend to adopt 400 gig and 800 gig continues to remain strong. So they focus on R&D, and new innovations remain strong. Moving on to aerospace and defense business, obviously, it was still a strong quarter for us, but we did not see the typical year-end surge that we would expect given the budget appropriations process. And then moving to EISG end markets, all of the markets remain strong, right? Automotive, we had strong double-digit growth as continued investments and inflection from EV and AV are playing out. Semiconductor is an area we watch carefully. But because of our exposure into the wafer stage equipment process and new node -- specifically new nodes, that remains strong. And lastly, the general electronics business, which typically gets -- part of its spend from PMI continued to remain strong from a demand perspective. So I would say we're doing well, and the customer activity with our customers and engagements remain strong and quite pleased with the -- with our quarter in this environment.
Angela Zhang: Great. And then just for my follow-up, you posted 10% revenue growth this year. And I know your long-term guide is sort of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Just what are you thinking sort of broad strokes for fiscal '23 revenue growth where you -- did you see a pull forward with supply easing? And so could there be an air pocket in fiscal '23? Or do you still expect to sort of perhaps trend above your typical long-term range?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We remain confident, Angela, with what we see so far. Obviously, it's an uncertain environment. So, we're guiding one quarter at a time. You see the confidence reflected in our Q1 guide, which we feel good about. And as we look forward, we'll look at the demand environment, and we'll keep you updated as we go.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: I just kind of want to follow up on those comments on the market demand commentary. I mean orders were -- I think you said steady each month of the quarter and up 9% year-on-year. So what should we make of the commentary that maybe customers are being a bit more cautious because, Satish, you just kind of ramp through all the different subsegments and businesses. And it seems like everything is going quite strong. Should we take this as maybe an indicator that fiscal Q1 orders are easing a bit? And ultimately, does this push the growth profile back to that 4% to 6% normalized range? Or should it sink below that?
Mark Wallace: Chris, this is Mark. I'll take that and add a little bit more detail here. So as Satish said, our order level was steady throughout the quarter. So, we're watching this, right, because if customers are taking more time to make decisions, you would look for orders to slow down. They did not. As a matter of fact, October was very strong. It was a record October for us in terms of orders. So that's good. You've heard us talk about before the addition of new customers. We've added about 450 this quarter again for nearly 2,000 new customers across the whole year. So that creates more diversity and durability to our business, and I see that paying off. Our top 20 customers in the quarter were up strong double digits as well. So, all of that continues to translate to the fact that we did not see an impact to our business because of the customers taking more time. And I think it also has to do with the fact that we are so biased toward R&D and design optimization. And as we've seen through other waves in the recent term where market slowed, the advanced technology development continues. So that's what we see, but we look around and we do see some macro uncertainty. And from my seat, what I see in terms of order or in terms of customer activities is very active customers. Our six-month funnel continues to grow, but customers are taking more time to make ultimate CapEx decisions.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. And this is Neil. I just give you a little bit maybe more quantification of the situation going into Q1. So while we don't guide orders, I would point out that we have a bit of a difficult compare here in the first quarter. A year ago, in Q1, that was the first time in Keysight's history that we'd ever posted order growth moving from the end of Q4 into the first quarter of the new fiscal year. So we've got a tough compare from that perspective. In addition, as you all know, the U.S. dollar began to strengthen pretty significantly in the back half of this year. We estimate the FX headwind in our first quarter to be a full five percentage points. And so we've got a five-point FX headwind. And we estimate another two to three points of headwind from the recent increase in China trade restrictions as well as the loss of our Russia business, which happened in the second quarter of last year. So those things combined give us a seven- to eight-point headwind just coming out of the gate here as we enter the first quarter.
Chris Snyder: Appreciate that. And on the commentary that customers are taking longer to order, maybe they're ordering slower, how do you separate kind of the supply chain element of that from the demand element? Because if supply chains are generally moving in the right direction, I think that maybe customers will not kind of order with the same lead times or urgency that we saw last year.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Chris, I think you're right. I think as the supply chain continues to ease and the delivery duration that it takes for us to fulfill an order continues to pull in, you would expect some level of normalization as well. And we -- the reason we also put out the demand environment is moderating is we're starting to also see some of our customers who earnings -- whose earnings has fallen also put additional scrutiny on spend, right? And so that takes a little bit more time to close the deal as they go through their process. So those are some factors. Neil, I don't know if you want to -- I know you've commented on the normalization before.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I guess the only other point that we make around that level is, if you look at our last three years, we've averaged a book-to-bill over the last three years of 1.09 driven first by COVID, obviously, then by the supply chain disruption that's happened over the last, say, 18 months. And so we've known for some time that, that book-to-bill had to normalize. And as our lead times come in, we would expect that normalization to occur. And so, as I think about it -- and again, we're not guiding orders, but a move of our book-to-bill back to a more normal level, something approaching one is not something that's going to impact our ability to continue to grow revenue.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Two follow-ups. I want to go back to CapEx to 250. Should I assume that capital intensity will remain around 3% in fiscal year '23?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I mean one of the things that's happening with our CapEx is our capital purchases in this fiscal year were definitely impacted by the broader supply chain environment. And so we guided at the beginning of the year -- I'm talking about fiscal '22 now -- to CapEx that was close to $250 million, and we significantly underspent that from a cash flow perspective. But what you can't see is that our commits were very much in line with our original expectations. It just took longer for things to be delivered. And so, what we're seeing as we go into next year is a pretty dramatic scaling back of new capital purchases, but with a little bit of a cash flow overhang as we go into next year. And so that's what's going to carry our capital purchases up to that $250 million level in fiscal '23.
Mehdi Hosseini: So, I shouldn't use your CapEx guide to come up with some revenue guide or revenue growth expectation for fiscal '23? There is some cash flow as per the CapEx, right?
Neil Dougherty: That's right.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then, I want to go back to China. The APAC region as a percentage of revenue has remained in the low 40% over the past several years, including the headwind from Huawei. Should I assume that you're growing outside of China so much should extend that you're able to offset increased restriction on shipment to China? Is it just a mix within the APAC region that makes China kind of neutralized?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think maybe as we have spoken before, we have a broad-based business in China. And despite the ongoing geopolitical situation, we have a demonstrated ability to pivot and address customers in that region. And given the focus there on technology development, I think we're seeing good demand in the region, but we're also seeing multinational companies that are creating -- that are moving out of China in some ways and into rest of Asia Pac and other parts of the world, including onshoring moves into North America, and we're successfully capturing some of that spend as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So the fact that the supply chain is moving out sort of China, that's positive. Now if I may, just a quick follow-up. So you do have more than 50% exposure to your customers' R&D budget. On top of that, there is a structural changes happening with the supply chain that is also positive. And those two factors on aggregate could offset some of the cyclicality nature or production-related sensibility or volatility. Is that the right way to think about this?
Satish Dhanasekaran: I think that's what's playing out right now for us, yes.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Matthew Niknam: Two, if I could. First on backlog. So you mentioned you ended the year at about $2.55 billion. I think our math would suggest something about $100 million higher, just relative to the 2.5 you mentioned last quarter. I'm just wondering if there's any order cancellations to be aware of or if there's an FX component affecting this? And then secondly, on the China trade restrictions, I think you'd called out a two to three percentage point headwind from those restrictions. I'm just wondering, is that incremental in fiscal 1Q? And is this primarily an EISG? Or could it show up elsewhere?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil. I'll take the backlog question and then let Mark address the China question. But yes, so you're -- I mean, obviously, our orders within the quarter outpaced revenue by a little bit more than $100 million. So we do continue to add to the backlog as we've gone throughout the year.
Mark Wallace: Yes. And Matt, the specific China trade situation that went into effect on October 7. So there wasn't much effect in our Q4. We will see some effect in our first quarter, but the 1% to 2% is projecting out over a run rate of the business for the entire year based on other situations. The other thing just to note is that we have not seen any changes in our cancellations. It's been running at a historically low level for the last four quarters, and that was the case again in Q4.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Aaron Rakers: Congrats on good execution in the quarter. I just want to at a high level go back to kind of the defensibility of the model, if I can. Can you remind us where the mix of the business stands today between R&D exposed versus, let's say, manufacturing exposed? And I guess on that same kind of thought process is that, where do you stand as far as the monetization effect of the software strategy? Where do we think that progresses to over the next year, whatever time frame you want to think about?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you for the question. I think at the highest level, we're at approximately 60% R&D today, 30% manufacturing and 10% deployments. So that's the sort of mix of the business. Clearly, we believe R&D secular, you look at some of the areas in R&D that we're focused on, that involve next-generation innovations such as with 5G and then 6G and automotive and digital health, so on and so forth. And it really gives us this diversity of applications that is -- gives us a resilience in this environment for sure. With regard to the software strategy, it, again, goes congruent with our with our go-to-market approach because we're here to enable innovations to happen faster. And the way we do that is by offering more software-centric solutions. So as we deploy more solutions to our customers, increasingly, that is in the form of growing software mix. And that goes, again, synergistic with our services strategy. So you look at our software and services revenue this year will end at 3% of the total mix and our ARR, or annual recurring revenue, has reached a new high of $1.2 billion. And we'll continue to invest to grow those portions of the business and increase our resilience and durability over time as well.
Aaron Rakers: Yes. And then as a quick follow-up, if I can. Just curious, when we think about the progression of backlog, and we appreciate that your backlog is only looking out on a forward six-month basis. And Neil, just curious, how should we think about what a normalized backlog level looks like?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean given some of the dynamics that Satish just talked about, increasing software services, recurring revenue, we have seen growth in our deferred revenue over the same three-year period of time as well as our migration towards systems rather than tools, I think, will drive our ultimate backlog level when things normalize to be significantly higher than it was, say, pre-COVID in the 2018, 2019 time frame. And so I think we'll have to see how that plays out over time. I think again, we built -- you can do the math. We built well north of $1 billion of backlog over the course of the last three years as we've had this book-to-bill that I've mentioned of 1.09. And as our lead times come in, we're going to expect ordering patterns to adjust and lead times to pull in. I've said previously that there's probably four to five weeks' worth of kind of abnormal backlog as a result of a four- to five-week extension of lead times kind of on average would be a way to think about it.
Satish Dhanasekaran: We're still in a supply challenge environment. While it's improving, supply is the constraining factor right now.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.
Jim Suva: It's very noteworthy and impressive about your software and services, which I think is about 34%. Is it -- can you help us understand, like, reasonable growth as a percent of totality going forward? Because I would imagine it's very hard to ever get over 50%. Or are you looking at a point where it starts to level off around 35%? Or is that way too low, 40%? Where can this kind of feasibility go for software and services as you kind of look at adding these incremental benefits to your sales process?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Jim, I think as a strategy, as a company from -- in 2015, we've been focused on the software-centric solution strategy and really focused on our customers' most demanding and challenging problems that they have and solving this better than anyone else. And as we have continued to do that, our strategy has taken the form of not just prudency in sales, but our focus on this life cycle value creation for our customers, but also value capture for Keysight. And that's the journey we've been on. Some of the more newer solutions such as in Open RAN that we've talked about where we are seeing considerable traction, software alone is nearing 40%, 50% of the total sale value, and with a lot bigger portion of it being in the recurring category as well. So, we feel good about the continued traction we're seeing for our solutions. And so we continue to deploy the solution strategy over time, we will enter into new end market verticals. And as you've seen some examples I put out this latest earnings announcement, we've also had some successes in the automotive sector with deploying software and in the semiconductor as well with our design offerings. Mark may make some comments on the sales side.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. And Jim, what I would ask is the go-to-market, you mentioned that, and that is an important element of this. We are attaching upfront attached services and software. We're at about 60% for services today. I want to see that grow. So that's another stream of advancement. The other thing that you can see is we are delivering solutions more and more through updates to our software. If you think about our 5G solutions going from Release 15 to Release 16 and 17, much of that is software updates that creates additional opportunities for up-sell, cross-sell and, of course, recurring revenue as well. So there's -- and there's several elements of our go-to-market that we are deploying now to encourage that recurring growth and expansion of attachment upfront to our total solutions.
Jim Suva: Great. And then my follow-up is on the China. I think I heard two to three points of headwind. Is that for kind of the full fiscal year? Was there any, like, in calendar -- I'm sorry, fiscal Q4, like buying ahead of the rule changes? I'm just trying to kind of triangulate around the magnitude of it. And I assume after fiscal '23, it's kind of all out of the model from the rule changes.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Jim, I think we said one to two points of headwind for the entire fiscal year '23. And again, that's based on what we estimate as the run rate of business that won't be available to us with the new trade restrictions. There will be a little bit more in Q1 as we look at some of the backlog, but that's the run rate. And then there was another -- I think Neil mentioned another point of headwind with -- from Russia.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Meta Marshall: In the past, you guys have talked about kind of the 5G peak was going to be much lower than kind of investors were expecting, but you kind of talked about a '23, '24 time period for the 5G peak. I just wanted to kind of get current thoughts on that and just how initiatives like ORAN or just some of the other initiatives are maybe extending that. And then maybe a second, you gave some context that you're seeing some loosening in supply chain. But just kind of what is current thinking? Is it still just a small amount of parts that you're kind of waiting to release? But just when do you see more general availability of those parts and just kind of a tightening between supply and demand?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Meta. I think on the 5G front, I think as we have always stated, there are multiple catalysts. I think about 18 months ago, I said the first catalyst was the C-band deployments in the U.S. That's played out as we had hoped, and we have captured a lot of that spend. We are pleased with some action that's happening in Asia and India, parts of India that have made commitments to roll out 5G. So that's, again, opportunity for us that's playing out right now. But the second and the third part to this is the millimeter wave opportunity. There's still some complex challenges with millimeter wave that customers are trying to solve. That continues to be a longer-term R&D opportunity for us as that deployment has continued to push out anyway -- scale deployments anyway. And lastly, as 5G is deployed, operators are looking to further monetize by adding the SA versions and new applications such as Open RAN continue to be gain traction across the global ecosystem. And so, the opportunity that we have in R&D continues to grow, and we're well positioned with the comprehensive offerings we have to address it. I also want to point out that we have a very diversified business. Yes, 5G gets a lot of attention, but we have secular trends in wireline evolutions, which we're well positioned to capitalize on based on the acquisitions of Ixia that we have made, and we continue to see traction there. Not to mention the newer additions to our go-to-market with automotive and with next-generation semiconductor nodes. So we run a diversified business, and I think that's a source of greater stability for us and over time. And the second part of the supply chain question that you asked is, at the beginning of last year, we took a series of actions to basically redesign our products to second source components, and we had a -- we've talked about it on earnings calls. And all those actions have really enabled us to do better than we expected every quarter. But as we think about the supply chain, I speak with a number of our semiconductor supply chain partners, and they're all putting actions in place to obviously increase capacity, but it still continues to be a constrained environment. We're not back to this pre-COVID sort of supply environment yet and might take all of '23 to get there from our best information right now.
Operator: Our next line of questions comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Sure. You talked about some of the headwinds to revenue in the first quarter, but one tailwind not mentioned is pricing. And just sort of wondering how significant is pricing today versus more normal levels. I mean you're giving a couple of points tailwind from that. And then what type of volume growth is really embedded into first quarter's guidance?
Neil Dougherty: What was the last part of the question? I'm sorry, David, I missed just that last part.
David Ridley-Lane: The type of volume growth is embedded in the first quarter guidance.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I think the pricing question -- obviously, we've had -- we've been doing our best to keep pace with inflation. We've had multiple rounds of price increases over the course of the last 12 to 18 months, and those are embedded in the backlog. Although I think you can see based on the fact that we have maintained margins over the course of fiscal '22, it's flat at 65%, which frankly, I think in this inflationary environment was a very strong result that we're basically keeping pace on a margin basis with what we're seeing in terms of increases. And so -- and right now, while on the one side, yes, we have these increases that are embedded in our backlog and will continue to yield dividends and revenue, it's not like the inflationary elements have stopped in the cost structure as well. I referenced, for example, that we are going to be doing our salary administration for next year here in our fiscal first quarter. And this will be our second consecutive year with salary increases that are materially above our historic averages. As to the volume question, given the nature of our business where we're selling instruments that literally cost, in some cases, hundreds of dollars and, in other cases, cost $1 million, that's a very difficult question to answer. There's such a high deviation of mix that -- it's really hard to get to a meaningful answer on that question.
David Ridley-Lane: Sure. And as a follow-up, another tailwind here is autos, right? I think last quarter, you mentioned that it's basically doubled over the last two years. This quarter, you mentioned $500 million in orders. So it's nearing close to 10% of your orders in this fiscal year. Do you feel like the trend there is kind of I don't want to say, not cyclical -- not subject to sort of macroeconomic condition, but certainly has a strong secular element to it.
Mark Wallace: David, this is Mark. I'll answer that. The growth we're seeing is coming from next generation mobility. There's some continuing R&D on the electronics side that's more conventional, but the growth in new mobility is sustaining. It is secular. And it doesn't just stop at the vehicle. It goes out into the charging infrastructure, into the underlying battery technologies. And we've seen what's happened here in the last year with different countries and different regulations pushing this further toward adoption. The adoption in Europe is very strong and growing fast, in other regions as well. And our position in the market is very strong, helping our customers design and deploy this next-generation technology from the batteries to the charging infrastructure and then add, on top of that, all the connectivity and communications and protocols, as we talked about in the prepared statement. So, this is really a great intersection of multiple strengths for us, and it has long-term secular growth drivers behind them.
Operator: Our next line of question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is now open.
Rob Mason: Neil, I wanted to just clarify, you mentioned that R&D I thought would be roughly 16% of revenue this year. I just want to make sure that's correct because that's about one point more than it was this past year in '22. And just I'm curious how that steps up. And what does an exit rate look like if that's the case?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So you're right. Obviously, our 16% or 16% plus has been our long-term target. We under spent that here in FY '22. I think a big function of that was the revenue outperformance within the year. If you remember, this time last year, we guided you to 6% revenue growth on the year, and we actually grew 12% on a core basis. And so, our R&D plans for the year were much more aligned with that lower level of revenue growth. So, I think as we go -- we certainly continue to see a large amount of opportunity for us to continue to invest in the future growth of our business, a lot of pull from our customers to do R&D work. And so, our intent is to revamp back towards 16% of revenue. Obviously, the salary administration here in the first quarter is going to help to move us in that direction. We may not get to 16% here in the first quarter, but looking at an exit rate that's at 16% or even potentially a little bit above by the time you get out to the fourth quarter is not out of the question.
Rob Mason: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then to the extent the supply chain does still remain somewhat tight through the year, how are you thinking about working capital? And any ability or -- to pull that down as you go through the year, what are you thinking about working capital contribution for the year?
Neil Dougherty: Well, I certainly think over the longer term that as the supply chain normalizes, there will be an opportunity for us to reduce some of the working capital that's built up over the course of the last year. We see it in terms of inventory, at least inventory via the prices that we're paying for parts. We see it money tied up in terms of commitments to buy future inventory where we paid in advance for future delivery -- has been a use of working capital that, frankly, is new over the course of the last 12 months. And then frankly, the supply chain situation has significantly impacted the linearity of our revenue within the quarter. You can imagine when you move from more of a just-in-time environment where you're just building and shipping and building and shipping. We're doing a lot more build to a certain stage, wait for parts, finish and ship. And so, our revenue is tended to be more back-end loaded, which results in us carrying more receivables at the end of the quarter than we would if we were shipping in a more linear fashion. So again, I think it's a function of how does supply chain normalize and when does that eventually happen? That is -- you need a little bit of a crystal ball to answer that question. But when it does happen, we would see -- we would expect to see an ability to reduce working capital.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Dante, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. As he mentioned, that concludes the call, and we wish you all a good evening and look forward to seeing you soon.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Keysight Technologies delivered another exceptional quarter with both revenue and EPS, our earnings per share exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Our outperformance reflects the effectiveness of our strategy, outstanding execution by our teams around the world, and the strength of our operating model. Keysightâs deep customer engagements with industry leaders and high-value differentiated solutions continue to drive broad-based demand across key technology megatrends. I will focus my comments today on three key headlines. First, outstanding execution by the Keysight teams around the world resulted in an all-time record revenue and earnings per share as we saw some supply constraints ease as the quarter progressed. Second, we saw strong order growth and sustained demand across all end markets and regions. Third, we are once again raising our full year outlook. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 9% and earnings per share growth of approximately 20% for the full fiscal year. Letâs now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Third quarter orders grew 12% to $1.46 billion and outpaced record revenue, which grew 10% to $1.38 billion. Record EPS of $2.01, grew 31%. Orders and revenue growth in both business segments and across all regions is evidence of our ability to deliver value for customers as we manage macro and supply dynamics. Software revenue achieved an all-time high, outpacing total Keysight revenue growth, expanding our recurring revenue profile to further strengthen the durability of our business. Our software-centric solution strategy is a key differentiator in rapidly evolving design, systems emulation and modeling environments. We recently introduced PathWave Advanced Design System 2023 to address growing complexity in ultra-high frequency designs. We also announced that Keysightâs Open RAN solutions are moving to cloud-based deployment to support our customersâ needs as networks evolve to more software-enabled virtualized architectures. Turning to our business segments. The Communications Solutions Group delivered all-time record revenue and record third quarter orders. Commercial Communications achieved record revenue with growth across all industry segments and regions. Innovation dynamics across the Communications ecosystem remains strong, driving demand Keysightâs comprehensive end-to-end portfolio for both the wireless and wireline ecosystems. In wireless, 5G continues to represent an innovation-rich environment for the industry. Our differentiated software-centric solutions enable customers to address the growing complexity of use cases, frequency band combinations, real-world connectivity and mobility challenges. We continue to evolve our 5G platform to meet the requirements of emerging applications and newer versions of the standards. In collaboration with, Intel, Radisys, Vodafone and Wind River, we recently showcased an industry-first demonstration, deploying Keysightâs O-RAN and solutions to help reduce power consumption in a multi-vendor Open RAN network. AI-LINK, a provider of industrial IoT offerings, used Keysight solutions for end-to-end performance validation of cloud-native radio access network infrastructure. In wireline, we continue to see strong demand for 400 gig, 800 gig and photonics applications. We recently collaborated with Nokia to demonstrate the first public 800-gig interoperability test, validating the robustness of ultra-high data rates in telco networks and data center environments for the expected increase in AI, ML network workloads. Record Q3 orders in aerospace, defense and government outpaced revenue, which grew 1% on a core basis versus a strong growth quarter last year. Budget appropriations began to flow as reflected in prime contractor spending in the U.S., while 5G investments continued to grow to address new use cases such as RADAR and 5G coexistence. We also saw strong strength in satellite and space, including new applications for nonterrestrial networks. Over the next several years, we expect this market will benefit from elevated investments in technology modernization. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, with momentum from continued investments in next-generation technologies across automotive, industrial IoT and semiconductor end markets. In automotive, we are pleased with the continued broad adoption of our solutions portfolio, with the business nearly doubling over the past 2 years. Orders grew strong double-digits for the sixth consecutive quarter, and we delivered all-time record revenue. Keysightâs contributions to the advancement of EV and AV technologies, which include vehicle intelligence, connectivity, power and security are fueling momentum with leading car manufacturers and helped us secure wins with giga factories around the world. Keysightâs award-winning Radar Scene Emulator is the only solution on the market to imitate realistic roadway scenarios in a lab environment, and was chosen by a leading U.S. auto manufacturer for testing and validation of autonomous drive systems. This quarter, we completed another tuck-in acquisition in the automotive space, further adding to our software technology and technical staff focused on vehicle-to-everything communications. We continue to invest as we target evolving opportunities in the future of transportation. In general electronics, we achieved double-digit order growth and all-time record revenue as investments continued in digital health, IoT and advanced research. In educational research, Keysight is partnering with global leaders such as Nanyang Technological University in Singapore to advance 6G technology. Together with Sauce Labs, our Eggplant business delivered artificial intelligence-driven testing of enterprise applications. The acceleration in our general electronics business reflects the broad scope of our portfolio of leading technology solutions. Record orders for our semiconductor solutions resulted in ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth driven by capacity expansion of mature foundries to address pent-up demand in the market and investments in advanced processes. Keysightâs PathWave design solutions expands our collaboration with major foundries beyond parametric wafer test into emerging applications like silicon photonics and next-generation design and simulation applications. While we continue to successfully execute our strategy, we recognize the near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. Keysightâs sustained performance over time is evidence of the resilience and durability of our business. Our resilience is an outcome of enduring partnerships with market-leading customers with early engagement to develop software-centric solutions that enable them to solve their most critical development challenges and achieve their first-to-market goals. Durability is a product of our flexible operating model designed to quickly respond to variations in demand while investing in critical long-term priorities. These strengths give us confidence that we can navigate uncertainties, and continue to deliver superior results going forward. Of course, all of this is made possible by our talented people. Steadfast execution by our teams, especially in a challenging environment, is proof that our Keysight leadership model delivers results, empowering our inclusive and diverse culture which fosters collaboration, high performance and innovation. We recently released our first diversity, equity and inclusion report as we renewed and strengthened Keysightâs longstanding commitment to DE&I and to being a great place to work for our global workforce of more than 14,000. With that, I will turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish and hello everyone. We delivered strong third quarter results, successfully navigating ongoing supply chain and other headwinds. Third quarter 2022 revenue of $1.376 billion was $26 million above the high end of our guidance range, and grew 10% or 13% on a core basis. We generated $1.461 billion in orders, up 12% or 14% on a core basis, and we ended the quarter with $2.5 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 65%, holding steady in the face of significant inflation and currency headwinds. Operating expenses were $480 million, resulting in an operating margin of 30%. We used a number of strategies to effectively navigate supply chain challenges, including product redesign, alternate sourcing and increased supplier and customer engagement. We achieved net income of $363 million and delivered $2.01 in earnings per share, which was $0.21 above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 181 million shares. Despite significant currency headwinds on the top line, we saw negligible FX impact to earnings due to the meaningful natural hedge provided by our global footprint that has been supplemented by our financial hedging program. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $970 million, up 11% or 13% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 67% and record operating margin of 30%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated record revenue of $694 million, up 17% or 19% on a core basis, driven by 5G, O-RAN, 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit and high-speed digital applications. Aerospace and defense and government revenue of $276 million was down 2% and up 1% on a core basis. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we continue to expect increasing defense budgets in the U.S., Europe and Japan to provide support for higher spending going forward. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated third quarter revenue of $406 million, up 10% or 13% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth across all end markets and regions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 14% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.6 million shares at an average price per share of $139.46 for a total consideration of $228 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 4.6 million shares for a total consideration of $723 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight solutions. Our funnel is near historic high levels, and we exit the quarter with a record backlog. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 9% or 11% on a core basis with EPS in the range of $7.43 and to $7.49, representing growth of 20% at the midpoint. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.38 billion to $1.4 billion, with earnings per share in the range of $1.94 to $2, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 180 million shares. In closing, Keysightâs resilient business, consistent execution and flexible cost structure give us confidence in our ability to capitalize on the long-term secular growth trends and deliver above-market profitable growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Satish and Neil, for your comments. Amber, would you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator:  Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Jim, your line is now open.
Jim Suva: Thank you and congratulations to you and your entire team and company. My question isâ¦
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim.
Jim Suva: Yes. Automotive traditionally hasnât been a big focus area for Keysight. You provided a little bit of commentary on it, but it appears that the car of the future and all the cars that are rolling out have a much bigger need for â whether it be EV, battery calibration, sensors positioning. How much is automotive for you? What has kind of been growing? And importantly, is there like long-term visibility? Are you in that â in the production side of things also, or just only in the R&D traditionally, I think about you more as R&D, but it seems like youâre kind of a little bit more into production or long life on automotive? But if you could pontificate on automotive sector, a little bit, that would be great. Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, sure, Jim. As you noted, this is one of the new expansion opportunities that weâre incredibly excited about, and weâre continuing to build momentum. And as you saw emerging from the pandemic, this big acceleration into EV and AV has just gotten started. And from a manufacturing perspective, yes, we have some exposure to it, but it is this proliferation of electronics content thatâs causing automakers to ramp up production as supply becomes lesser and lesser of an issue over time. So itâs all about testing their EV capabilities in the manufacturing environment. So we have some exposure to that. We are very excited by this big trend we see thatâs going to play out over the next 10 years where auto makers are going to increasingly invest in organic R&D capabilities needed to differentiate their platform over others. And that involves software and hardware, and itâs a great fit for the broad array of tools that we offer to every electrical engineer in the planet that weâre now selling into the automakers. But equally, the growing emphasis we have put on â growing our footprint in EV. As an example, this quarter, we had some design wins with some giga factories that are coming up just getting started in the Radar Scene Emulator solution, which really allows you to take a car, turn on all the sensors and really see how we behave in the real world, very unique solution offering. And we had a design win with a major North American car manufacturer. So just getting started, very excited about the opportunity and strong double-digit growth in orders this quarter.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for details and clarification and congratulations.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Nick on for Matt. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question and a follow-up. First, on supply chain, I am just curious if you could give us an update in terms of what youâre seeing on the ground right now and maybe how that compares to like a quarter ago or a year ago? And then just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about your long-term targets at this point? I mean looking at order growth and revenue growth, youâre clearly surpassing that. So maybe like when we could expect updates on those?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Maybe Iâll get started, Neil might want to add some comments here. Iâll say on the supply chain front, I did reference that weâre very pleased with the execution. Itâs been now three or four quarters since we put the program in place to build out our capabilities to second source, extend our partnerships with suppliers tighter and ongoingly engaged with our customers on lead time reduction activities. So those have progressed very nicely. And as the quarter progressed, we saw some of the constraints get better as the quarter progressed, which resulted in the upside that we were able to generate in revenue, and delivered a very strong record revenue this quarter. I would say, on the macro supply situation, it still remains challenging. It is a tale of two worlds. On one hand, you have improved visibility and improved supply for general-purpose electronics parts, but high-precision electronics, analog components still appear to have constraints associated with them. But nevertheless, we are very pleased with our execution, and weâre also confident about our guide, which is why we have actually taken up the guide for Q4, and also for the full year to be now 9%. So thatâs with regard to the supply situation. With regard to your second question on the long-term guide on targets, yes, I mean, weâre also very pleased with the progression â ongoing progression that we see quarter-after-quarter towards those long-term targets we set, both for growth and profitability. And that was goals that we set for 2023. Weâre obviously executing very well towards those. And as we go into the fall, we will be having our 3-year strategic plan, and we look forward to updating you on any revised targets right after.
Unidentified Analyst: Alright. Thank you and congrats, again.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Morgan â Meta, apologies, your line is now open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, team. This is Dave on for Meta. Congrats on the quarter. You mentioned strength within the commercial communications group. And I was just wondering if there are certain categories within that group that are driving the growth. With some of the delays the ecosystem is seeing on O-RAN, are there areas where customers are asking you to be of greater assistance?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think our commercial communications portfolio is a diversified one that services both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, saw broad strength across both this quarter â and again, continued strength for the last few years driven by 5G on the wireless side and a number of technology evolutions like 400 gig, 800 gig on the wireline side. Iâll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the details for this particular quarter.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Satish. As Satish said, Dave, the 5G rollout and demand continues to be very strong. And our bias toward R&D solutions is an area of investment for all of our customers. We saw double-digit demand and order growth across all regions. One of the drivers is the adoption and upgrades around Release 16. Weâre seeing that across the board. Weâre seeing adoption now with some of the certification business in the test labs. We added more than 90 new 5G customers again during Q3. Weâre seeing continued growth of O-RAN where weâve been expanding our opportunities from device manufacturers to operators to test labs and etcetera. So wireless side, the demand remains strong and broad. And as Satish said, on the wireline side and the data center side, we continue to see strong investments in the quarter for 400G manufacturing plus continued even ramping investments around 800 gig R&D and on both the physical layer and the protocol space. So robust demand. Our differentiation for many, many years, continues to expand our ability to contribute to these customers around the world.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. Chris, your line is now open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I have a question on the backlog, which is obviously running well above historical or even normalized levels. Is it fair to assume that pricing in the backlog is above the pricing that has been realized in revenues over the last couple of quarters? And what does that mean for forward price cost?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. It is â I mean it is true that we have been undergoing a series of price increases as we attempt to kind of keep place with the inflation that weâre seeing on the cost side of the equation. And it is also true, as weâve talked about in the past that it can take time for those price increases to actually be realized within revenue given the backlog, given the funnel, given the outstanding quotes that exist within the marketplace. And so it is certainly true that we have price increases that are built into our backlog. I think the second, beg your question is a little bit harder to answer because we donât know exactly what is forthcoming on the inflation side, right? Whether that continues, whether it starts to wane, but we do expect to start to realize additional benefits from price increases that have already been enacted.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And weâre very pleased with the 65% gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of inflationary environment that Neil referenced.
Chris Snyder: Thank you for that. I think on the last earnings call, you guys said that the guidance assumed further backlog build in 2H. Obviously, we got a little bit more backlog built here in the fiscal third quarter. I guess, is the assumption that we will be further backlog build in Q4? Iâm just asking because it sounds like from the prepared remarks that some of the supply constraints have been easing.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Yes, that is fair to say. I mean if you look at the look at the order number that we put up last year, $14.91 in Q4 of last year, we are expecting orders to continue to grow. We have a strong funnel here entering the quarter. And so by definition, that implies additional backlog build in the quarter.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And the demand environment continues to remain strong, and across our end markets and across all regions. So we continue to build a backlog, but itâs a high-quality backlog where we have touch points with customers and â who have real needs. And so we will be working really hard to get that converted to revenue as we look into the next 6 months.
Chris Snyder: If I could just squeeze â just a follow-up with that, Satish, very quickly, is there anything specific that is just driving the outsized strength in the demand backdrop? Iâm just asking what should we be looking for or waiting for to kind of try to determine when demand is going to normalize back to the mid-single digit or even kind of high single-digit growth level?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Weâre quite pleased with the portfolio, the differentiation, the focus on the R&D customer. The areas that weâre investing to build solutions for, continue to remain a high priority for our customers. But weâre also cognizant of the macro environment and the evolving macro, and watching for it. As an example, one of the areas we look for is in our industrial business, which is linked to PMI. But that business had a very strong quarter yet again. But Mark may be able to make some forward-looking comments on the funnel.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Well, Chris, weâve said that itâs been broad-based, and it certainly has â you saw the growth come across all the end markets across all the regions. Our top customers, top 20 were up double-digit. We added more than 400 new customers in total during the quarter. Our indirect business and the channel was strong. So that shows the reach that weâre getting into new customers. And as Neil mentioned, our 6-month funnel is at or near an all-time high. Weâre watching it very carefully. Some customers are being a bit more cautious in their spend, but itâs not reflected in our numbers, and itâs not reflected in what weâre seeing is overall demand going forward.
Chris Snyder: Thank you, guys. Congrats on another great quarter.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SFG. Mehdi, your line is now open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. This is for the entire team. Keysight has been known for having exposure to both R&D budgets as well as commercial deployment. Would it make sense to change that thought process, and actually qualitatively or quantitatively talk about secular demand drivers like satellite communication, millimeter wave, infrastructure investment, electric vehicle and so forth? So this way, we could better understand the underlying demand drivers. Any thoughts would be appreciated. And I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you, Mehdi. I think the way we think about our business is we look at the new emerging technologies where customers are looking to innovate, and not just for a year or 2 years, but they are looking at a multiyear roadmap. Thatâs our focus, solving their more complex challenges, such as the ones you described in space and satellite, in commercial communications with both on the wireless and wireline side with evolving needs for capacity, which drives millimeter wave consumption, EV and AV, all of these are innovation-rich areas. We are making a unique contribution to enable our customersâ time to market. Thatâs the focus for us, and we will look to provide more insight as we move forward on these areas. Thanks for the input.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. I think we all understand how Keysight is differentiated and how well you have executed, especially with all the supply chain disruption over the past 2 years. And as much as Neil has been talking about the normalization of the backlog, it continues to grow, which reflects your core strength. I guess we are all trying to figure out whatâs the companyâs earning power and sustainability of that earning, $8 going to $10 and then to $12. I think the thought process of the past that 5G would pick is off the table. And I guess I am trying to find a better way to highlight the opportunities as well as quantifying the earning power.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. No, I think you are spot on, right. You look at the backlog build, $2.5 billion roughly as we exit this quarter and then we have a whole quarter in front of us to exit the fiscal year. So, we fully expect that the backlog will continue to grow, which gives us increased stability. And as the supply situation improves, that just converts into earnings power for the company. The other area that I am very pleased with is the gross margin performance of the business in the backdrop of these inflationary pressures we are seeing, which, over time, as we have thought about the value we bring and continue to innovate with software and services, we have more upside to continue to grow that margin profile over time. And so we are not done at 65%, which should give us further room for growth. And then when we look at the next-generation innovation drivers that we are engaged with our customers right now, we feel pretty confident about extending that runway of growth as well.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you and congrats.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Mehdi.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Mark, your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping to better understand what you are seeing from customers in the semiconductor end markets in the near-term. I think some semiconductor companies have been seeing some cyclical weakness and perhaps cutting back on CapEx plans. Are you seeing anything related to that in your business? And to put that over the intermediate to longer term, you have had the CHIPS Act signed. And I am curious, are you seeing any improved long-term outlook for your business going into the semiconductor end market that you would attribute to the CHIPS Act.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Mark, this is Mark. I will answer that. So, our business in semi remains very strong, robust demand, record orders in . And what we are seeing, and we have said this before is we are seeing continued investments in tow areas, right. One is in the advanced processes and the other is in the mature technologies, and both remained strong during the quarter. The other exciting part is we are starting to see the investments in the United States in new fabs. We have started to â we captured the first initial spend. You saw earlier this month, or maybe this last week, the U.S. Congress just passed the CHIPS package thatâs all in front of us. That expansion is going to help additional business, fuel additional growth to boost manufacturing in the U.S. And our R&D investments, itâs not just capacity expansion. We are also participating in parametric test as well as R&D test in these advanced processes from EUV to 5-nanometer, 3-nanometer. So, while some end market demand has slowed, there is still supply chain constraints in the semiconductor market. And the longer-term secular growth drivers are still strong driven by end markets like high-performance computing, automotive, we talked about and new mobility and silicon photonics where we have a leadership position feeding into high-speed data centers and so forth is an area we are very excited about as well.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Adam, your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi, good afternoon guys. Congrats on your first $2-plus EPS quarter. Just one on satellite and space, on satellite and space, how does that opportunity compare to some of the larger revenue buckets today, such as 5G and auto?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think itâs an area where historically, we were in the component test of the satellite ecosystem. That has been an area of strength for us and where we are highly differentiated and some of the unique metrology components do get into for â to calibrate some of the more complex measurements in that space. What we are seeing now as we look forward is new applications like non-terrestrial networks with the advent of 5G, and this proliferation of different satellite form factors and communication with ground stations, right. So, we are getting into emulating the whole environment so that we are designing better for the crowded satellite and space environment thatâs ensuing. But we are very pleased with the uptick we are seeing in the business for the entire portfolio because the number of customers that are in this industry also is expanding beyond the few big ones we used to have in the past. So, pleased with the growth in the business. It will continue to be a driver for our aerospace and defense business moving forward.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Mason with Baird. Rob, your line is now open.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could give us an update around your PathWave rollout and just where you think you are in that process? When you introduced PathWave, it was going to be a multiyear effort to roll in your legacy applications. You are introducing new applications under the PathWave umbrella as well. How should we think about where you are at least on the legacy side in terms of converting those over? You talked about software outgrowing the overall company average as well. And just how to PathWave play into that?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think if you look at the PathWave effort that we have put in place for a few years now, itâs really focused around building the organizational capabilities needed because the future of our industry is going to be software-centric. And so we have built capabilities, such as cloud that has enabled us to launch the O-RAN solution where we are now able to test virtualized network infrastructure. And the only way you do it is you have to have your assets on the cloud, and thatâs a critical component of how we deliver value through PathWave. The PathWave design franchise that we have had continues to grow. We have been able to convert majority of the customer base into recurring subscription-based contracts, and we are moving that franchise from just being able to simulate circuits to simulate circuits in complex environments. And thatâs a new area of emphasis that will continue to grow. And on our base instruments, it still remains a focus for us to add more capabilities, connect them to the cloud so that we make our customers more productive in their labs, and thatâs the focus for us moving forward. Bottom line is we are at 20% of our mix, roughly software. And the focus for us is to continue to grow that, and we will continue to invest in more software capabilities to do it. Mark, I donât know if you had any otherâ¦
Rob Mason: Thank you. If I could ask one follow-up, just unrelated around the aerospace and defense government business, the orders continue to be pretty strong there. But how do you see the ability to get, I guess convert more of those orders to revenue here over the next quarter or two quarters, or is it still more of a supply chain issue now that the budgets are flowing â budget showing up in orders, or are you getting the ability to ship?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean itâs â the conversion of orders to revenue is definitely a supply chain issue. I mean as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see the flow-through of the budget was appropriated in late spring. And so we are optimistic as we look forward into Q4, and even into Q1 that thatâs going to continue to drive growth. We are also seeing increased defense budgets in Europe and Japan, which is also additive. But as you start to think about converting that over, we are still very much supply constrained across the portfolio. And while we have seen some improvement in certain aspects of the supply chain within the quarter, we are still in that constrained environment. So, yes.
Mark Wallace: And Rob, this is Mark. I will just add that the previous  is another driver of growth, which is the intersection of many different segments or technology. We are talking about non-terrestrial network. We are talking about 5G deployment within aerospace defense. And then on top of that, you have the continuing long-term investment in defense modernization with funding beginning to flow from the U.S. government Department of Defense, and then Western Europe coming on very strong. So, there is a number of growth drivers on the front end, and that will continue for us moving forward.
Rob Mason: Understand. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. David, your line is now open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you for taking my question. The U.S. CHIPS Act also included about $1.5 billion dedicated to O-RAN, and there was sort of similar funding in the UK government as well. So, I just wanted to check in, any indication sort of the level of orders to-date for Keysight in the O-RAN space? How meaningful is that? And what do you think the impact of this kind of public funding thatâs going to start flowing there will be?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think in the broader context, you look at the â whatâs really changed significantly since the beginning of the year is the geopolitical environment, and it is going to drive more up in government investments for organic research across the globe. And for us, when we talked about drivers for the 5G business, we said near-term, itâs about the deployments. Medium-term, itâs about the millimeter wave and higher speed capabilities. And longer term, itâs about these new applications that are going to come online. And I think O-RAN has been one of those. We started to invest in that early. We are engaged in the O-RAN ecosystem. In fact we had the â we hosted the O-RAN consortium in our facility in Santa Rosa in this quarter to continue to drive the standardization around this nascent ecosystem. So, itâs an emerging opportunity, very exciting. Again, the â some of the strengths of the company with software continue to play into it. Now, with regard to immediate impact of public funding, your direct question, itâs really hard for us to assess that, but itâs definitely favorable as we think about where we invest and how we monetize.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then a quick follow-up here, you cited gross margin performance a couple of times. Just to help us think about pricing. Should we think about historical Keysight pricing kind of in a low-single digit range, and that you have moved up into a mid-single digit range. Is that kind of the order of magnitude around pricing? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I think when we think about pricing in the â letâs start over the longer term kind of outside of this recent inflationary environment. Our goal is always to capture the value that we are bringing into the marketplace. So, we have â and regularly assess our prices relative to the competition and the value that we are bringing into the marketplace and adjust them accordingly. I think in this inflationary environment, there has become little bit of a cost element as not just our suppliers, but our competitors and people across the broad ecosystem have been increasing prices in response to that inflation environment. So, I think you are correct in assuming that our pricing increases have moved northward over the course of, say, the last 12 months to 18 months in response to that inflationary environment.
David Ridley-Lane: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. There are currently no further questions in queue.  There are no further questions in queue, so that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Amber and thank you everyone for joining us today. We appreciate the opportunity to provide you with an update and look forward to speaking with many of you later this quarter. So, thank you and thatâs all for today.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Welcome to the second quarter 2022 earnings call and my first as the CEO of Keysight. I am humbled and honored to be Keysight's CEO and excited about the future. I would like to thank Ron Nersesian for his visionary leadership of the Company, which has provided us a solid foundation to build on. Over the last decade, I've had the honor of working closely with Ron and benefited greatly from his experience in many different roles I've held since joining the Company 16 years ago. This is a great time to be at Keysight as we remain focused on our core purpose of accelerating innovation to connect and secure the world. Keysight delivered exceptional results in quarter two, driven by strong execution and broad-based demand across the business. The team focused on innovating and solving customers' design and test challenges while successfully navigating the ongoing supply chain and geopolitical challenges. I will focus my comments today on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record quarter two orders, capitalizing on the robust end-market demand for Keysight's high-value differentiated solutions. Our focus on delivering first-to-market solutions is enabling us to uncover new emerging applications, adding to our momentum. Second, we achieved record revenue, strong operating margin performance, resulting in record earnings per share, which grew 27%, demonstrating the durability and resilience of our business. Third, we are raising our outlook for the year based on our strong performance in the first half and continued momentum. We now expect to achieve revenue growth approaching 8% and earnings per share growth in the range of 14% to 15% for the fiscal year. Let's now take a deeper look at our results for the quarter. Second quarter orders grew 9% to $1.46 billion and outpaced revenue, which grew 11% to a new record of $1.35 billion and was $41 million above the high end of our guidance. We achieved gross margins of 65%, operating margin of 29% and record EPS of $1.83, exceeding the high end of our guidance by $0.14. Also with the ongoing equity market volatility, we again capitalized on the opportunity to accelerate share repurchases. These results are a reflection of our strong portfolio and our global team's application of the Keysight leadership model, which enables us to deliver consistent value to all stakeholders. We delivered these results despite many headwinds, including geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and continued supply chain disruptions. We continue to advance our software-centric solution strategy as the rapid pace of technology accelerates, our customers across end markets are seeking deeper engagements earlier in the design cycle and are adopting our software solutions. The capabilities of our PathWave software platform facilitate continuous stream of releases that matches the innovation cadence of our customers. This enables us to secure enterprise agreements with market leaders for high-value R&D solutions. Orders for software and value-added services like KeysightCare again grew double digits as we continued to grow recurring revenue this quarter. Turning to our business segments. Communications Solutions Group delivered record second quarter orders and an all-time record revenue. Within CSG, commercial communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue with double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter. Ongoing innovation and investments in our end markets spanning both, the wireless and wireline segments remained strong, driven by adoption of 5G, 400 gig, 800 gig and terabit and optical technologies. In wireless, the increase in the number of 5G device types continues to drive test and certification requirements. With our leading solutions portfolio, we expect to benefit from the continued investment in the evolution of 5G standards, including stand-alone 5G, Release 16 and beyond. In quarter two, Keysight announced collaborations with leading companies such as NTT DOCOMO, Telefonica and Analog Devices to enable a wide range of 5G applications, including O-RAN, which continues to gain momentum. In wireline, we're enabling the digital transformation, driven by cloud computing and telecom stack virtualization through our end-to-end solutions. We recently launched the industry's first 800-gig solution to enable data center design workflows for ultra-high data rates and energy efficiency. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record Q2 revenue, driven by double-digit growth in Americas and strength in signal monitoring, cyber and space and satellite solutions as well as 5G and 6G applications. Complex scenario emulations continue to drive the need for modeling and digital twin solutions with increasing software content. Our leading network analyzer platform and phased array test solutions enable increasingly complex satellite communication design and test requirements. Increasing defense budgets in the U.S. and Europe are expected to provide support for higher spend going forward. CSG is well positioned to capitalize on growth by enabling innovation in our end markets through our broad and synergistic portfolio, including wireline, wireless, cybersecurity, satellite and space solutions. The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the seventh consecutive quarter, driven by automotive and semiconductor solutions. In automotive, all-time record revenue was driven by strong demand for our expanding portfolio of EV and AV applications. Keysight is capitalizing on strategic investments in the automotive and energy space, providing industry-first solutions that support new capabilities and use cases, such as our recently launched protocol test solution for in-vehicle networking. During the quarter, we secured EV wins with major OEMs across all regions. In addition, we're excited by the recognition of our new Radar Scene Emulator solution, including the 2022 Tech.AD Europe award. We saw strong demand for our semiconductor solutions, which delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Investments in advanced semiconductor technologies, along with capacity expansion for existing nodes, remain robust. Over the next 3 to 5 years, we see solid customer R&D roadmaps for ICs for a broader set of applications. As an example, in Q2, we sold our first on-wafer silicon photonics parametric test solution to a major semiconductor fab to develop and manufacture next-generation data center transceivers. We believe this trend represents long-term opportunities for Keysight's R&D solutions portfolio. Our general electronics business achieved all-time record revenue as investments continued in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health and advanced research. We're seeing active investments globally in fundamental research in terahertz and quantum technologies. For example, we recently announced a collaboration with National Research Foundation of Singapore's quantum engineering program to accelerate research and development and education in quantum technologies. The strength of our general electronics business reflects the broad nature of applications for our solutions. Before I wrap, I'd like to acknowledge and thank our more than 14,000 employees worldwide for their commitment to our customers around the globe and for their passion in delivering market-leading solutions. I'm proud to share that Keysight was recently named as one of Fortune 100's best companies to work for in 2022. This is a recognition of our inclusive and diverse culture exhibiting value for collaboration, high performance and innovation. Our culture also places high value on corporate social responsibility. We recently released our 2021 CSR report, highlighting our progress in environmental, social and governance efforts worldwide and announcing new goals to track through '22 and into '23. I believe Keysight has a bright future ahead. I look forward to working with the team to execute our strategy and continue to deliver greater value for our customers, shareholders and employees. With that, I'll turn the call over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook. Neil?
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Satish, and hello, everyone. Our performance this quarter once again demonstrated the resilience of our business. We delivered on our commitments and exceeded expectations as we powered through multiple challenges and new headwinds in the quarter. In the second quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1,351 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 11% or 12% on a core basis. We generated $1,458 million in orders, up 9% or 11% on a core basis. During the quarter, we suspended our operations in Russia and canceled our entire backlog of Russian orders. Core growth adjusted for Russia was 13%. Demand again outpaced supply, and we ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in backlog. Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 65% and operating expenses of $489 million, resulting in an operating margin of 29%. The strength of our results highlights the resiliency of our business and our team's ability to execute despite significant supply, cost and currency headwinds within the quarter. We achieved net income of $334 million and delivered $1.83 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 183 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $963 million, up 10% or 11% on a core basis. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. Within CSG, commercial communications generated revenue of $672 million, up 11% with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas, driven by strong demand for 5G device and component development as well as network test, O-RAN and terabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $291 million grew 7%. Our backlog for this end market remains strong, and we reported solid growth in the Americas and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated second quarter revenue of $388 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in automotive and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 62% and operating margin of 30%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $298 million and free cash flow of $245 million or 18% of revenue. Share repurchases this quarter totaled 1.9 million shares at an average price per share of $153.78, for a total consideration of $289 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased approximately 3 million shares for a total consideration of $495 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. The demand environment remains strong for Keysight solutions. As in recent quarters, our revenues continue to be constrained by tight supply conditions. However, we have demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate through this environment, and we remain confident in our ability to execute and deliver on our commitments. We expect third quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1,330 million to $1,350 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.80, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 181 million shares. We now expect full year revenue growth to approach 8%, which given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar now includes a 2-point year-over-year headwind from currency. We're also raising our earnings growth expectation to 14% to 15%. Despite quarter-to-quarter dynamics being difficult to predict, we have confidence in our raised expectations for the year. In closing, we have a strong track record of execution. Our backlog is at an all-time high, and we are well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities across our diverse set of end markets. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Tia, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator:  The first question is from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.
David Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. Wondering if you have seen an uptick in any supplier decommitments over the last few months. Obviously, China shutdowns have impacted a lot of electronic manufacturing, component suppliers and so forth. Wondering if you have seen any of that show up in your operations.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi, David. Thanks for the question. As you saw from our results this quarter, we had a very strong quarter from a revenue perspective. We're very pleased with the strong execution progress of the team. And the five-point program we've been running around strengthening our relationships with suppliers, finding alternate sourcing, being nimble in this environment has really paid rich dividends, along with some of the other initiatives we have. And while the supplier environment remains, in our view, pretty challenging, but we have found a way to find more upside. I would say that the demand from our customers is robust. And our customers want the products as quickly as we can make them, and we're shipping them as quickly as we can. So, the supply situation does remain challenging to the point you made, but we've been able to find a way around it. Thank you.
David Ridley-Lane: And as a quick follow-up to that, have your own lead times, the time to -- expected to ship the product, have those actually started to decline, or are they stabilizing at elevated levels? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we saw in a situation where -- this is Neil, by the way, where demand is outpacing supply. And so, we have not at this started to pull lead times back down. I would call our lead times generally stable. I'd say, they're slightly creeping north at this point with demand continuing to outpace supply. But by and large, on average, we see a lot of stability in lead times currently with the goal to work them down over time as the supply chain situation ultimately starts to loosen.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.
Matt Niknam: So first, on the fiscal 3Q revenue guide. Maybe, Neil, if you could talk about what's driving the expected sequential decline in revenues. And then maybe how you're thinking about core constant currency trends relative to any FX headwinds that are embedded in next quarter's guide. And then just secondly, on Europe and Asia Pac, I'm just wondering if you've seen any change in customer demand or buying patterns, given the Russia-Ukraine conflict that may be impacting Europe or even in Asia Pac, given the sort of the reemergence of lockdowns in China in recent months. Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: I'll take the first part of that, the question about the guide. As we've already stated, our revenue situation is still highly constrained by the supply environment. And we had significant outperformance in Q2 as we navigated the tight supply environment and did better than we expected. And so, -- but what you can read into that is that a significant portion of our Q2 outperformance was shipment of orders that we had originally or going into the quarter had scheduled to be in Q3. And so, that's great news, and we're pleased with that. But that -- on a quarter-over-quarter basis, that can be a significant impact. I would say that the guidance reflects our best estimate as we see it at this point in time. This quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be very difficult to call in this environment. We certainly have the backlog to do better if -- depending on how incoming supply works. And I think the point that we want everybody to focus on is that we are taking up the full year guidance significantly from 6% to 7% growth to approaching 8%. And that 8% growth, as you noted, has kind of new and significant FX headwinds. We saw a very significant strengthening of the dollar within our fiscal second quarter. We now have a 2-point year-over-year headwind in the second half that we're baking into account. And on the full year basis, we have a 1.5-point relative of FX. Just from November, when we put out the 6% to 7% guide to where we are today, saying approaching 8%, there's a new 1.5% FX headwind baked into that. And so, we feel very good about the situation as it currently sits and are pleased to be raising estimates for the year.
Mark Wallace: And Matt, hi. This is Mark. I'll address your second question on the kind of customer dynamics in Europe and Asia. So, in Asia Pac, we had double-digit order growth again as well as in China, where, as you noted, we had the COVID protocol restrictions and lockdowns. And it’s really a continuation of our ability to dynamically pivot and work with customers while both, in a face-to-face as well as a virtual remote nature. So, it's a testament to the broad strength and demand of our business across multiple industries and segments. In Asia, in particular, we saw strong continued demand and growth in automotive and semi, 400 gig, 800 gig, terabit, all of those things. So, very stable there. In Europe, we did see an impact, obviously, from the Russia cancellations. So, we had double-digit order growth in all regions except for Europe. But again, the demand continues. We saw a robust demand for our semiconductor solutions, again, automotive, our commercial comms across the European region. So, the broad interactions and dynamics with our customers so far remain pretty much unchanged.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking the questions. And Satish, nice to be speaking to you in your new role. I was hoping to start first on the auto business. You mentioned some strong growth there on your prepared remarks today. Maybe you could talk about how big that is now relative to the Company overall. And given some of the drivers, like autonomy and electric vehicles, how big do you think the auto business for Keysight could become in the coming years?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. I think, the auto business is very exciting for us for more than one reason, I would say. First, very strong quarter, obviously, building on many quarters where we've seen a very strong uptick in the business, primarily driven by this decade-plus long trends of electrification, autonomous driving. And we're actually feeding a number of these engineering labs with our tools and capabilities and solutions designed for this end market. We're engaging with the OEMs globally. We've had some successes, as I reported, in this quarter. And we're also working with the entire ecosystem with the Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers, the semiconductor houses that feed the auto and the test labs that are just growing across the world. So, it's a growing ecosystem. We're expanding our portfolio into EV, particularly around battery test, charging test, in-vehicle network testing as an example. And in AV, we're very excited by the new solution that we have offered for autonomous drive emulation, which is enabling in-loop, real-time, synchronized sensor evaluations, and this is a build on our 5G platform and capability. So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making, and we know that we have a long runway ahead with automotive.
Mark Delaney: That's very helpful. Thanks. And my follow-up question was on the EPS guidance. If I look at the midpoint of the 3Q guidance and also the midpoint of the full year EPS guidance, it would imply that fourth quarter EPS at the midpoint would be something like $1.89. And that would imply that the growth rate would be slowing from mid-teens year-on-year through the first three quarters on average to more like mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. So, I was hoping you could better contextualize the implied fourth quarter EPS guidance for us. And is there anything in terms of supply chain cost or mix that's perhaps impacting the rate of EPS growth in the fourth quarter? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So, I think you need to take a close look at our Q4 performance in FY21, which was a bit of an outlier at 31% operating margin, a full almost 4 points higher than the prior -- the sequential quarters leading up to that. And so, I think as you -- and the other -- one of the big drivers within the fourth quarter of last year, if you look at it, we had a sequential decrease in R&D investment that was quite substantial going from Q3 to Q4. And that is atypical. And so, we would expect increasing investments on a sequential basis as we move from Q2 to Q3 and then again as we move from Q3 to Q4 as we invest in the future and the future growth of our business. And so, again, we remain optimistic about our business. And some of these quarter-to-quarter perturbations can be difficult to call, but we are raising our both, revenue and EPS guidance for the year quite substantially and are focused on executing.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Samik Chatterjee: Satish, congratulations on your first earnings call in the CEO role. I guess, in your prepared remarks, you did mention the higher defense budgets, and if I could start with that. I mean, when should we be realistically expecting the higher defense spending budgets to start impacting sort of your order trends? What is the typical sort of time line that you see -- have seen in the past in terms of when you start to see the flow-through of that into your order trends? And I have a quick follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Samik. Of course, aerospace and defense business has been historically, as we have talked about, a GDP-plus business for us. It's very broad with 50% of the business tied to the U.S. or North America. And we're excited by the number of new areas that we're applying our technology to, space and satellite being one of them. And 5G and 6G adoption into this sector is a new opportunity for us. So, independent of the budgets, we're pleased with the traction we're making in applying our technology to offer new solutions. The budget is obviously a huge stability. I think the fact that you have bipartisan support for the defense budget growth in RDT&E line item for this year and then subsequent growth also projected for 2023, we view as a favorable sign. I think these geopolitical tensions tend to provide more stability not only in the U.S., but we're also expecting a similar uptick in Europe, and therefore, technology spend. But as we know, this business is an average over the long term, and we have been doing better than GDP, and our intent is to continue to do that and offer new solutions. With regard to the quote activity, I'll let Mark make a few comments.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Samik, this is Mark. I think just to add to Satish, the budget in the U.S. was approved. It was increased. And as we've been watching our customers, both the direct government and the prime contractors, we expect some of that funding to start flowing to new program starts here in our second half. So, we look forward to that. And as you probably know, as many of the programs nowadays are multiyear, this will flow into the fiscal year '23 and beyond. And you've been following what's going on in Western Europe as well with increased spend from the NATO nations, we'll see how that flows through. We expect that to be favorable as well. And then, I think the last thing I'll just mention is there are other aspects of this industry segment that are representing new growth opportunities for us around space. Commercial space in particular is a very hot area for us we continue to focus on. And then, the continuing modernization that we've been talking about for many quarters or years is a long-term trend that we're very excited about. We see a strong funnel of opportunities going into the future.
Samik Chatterjee: And for my follow-up, I guess this is more for Neil. But Neil, I mean, your 8% revenue growth guide for the year implies about a $150 million sort of half-on-half revenue performance, which is very similar to what we saw last year. I'm just wondering what you're capturing there in terms of improvements in the sort of supply environment in general versus your own capacity increases. And where would there be sort of more modest or sort of upside potential if supply of components are better? Just trying to understand sort of what's embedded because it seems very typical of -- compared to last year that your guidance is.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So, in prior quarters, we've talked about an expectation or thinking that we would see some material improvement in the supply chain situation in the second half of this year. To this point, we have not seen that. And in fact, I think if you look broader across the tech industry, there's an argument that things got incrementally worse in Q2, are more challenging, driven by the Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as the COVID shutdowns in China, even though those COVID shutdowns don't impact us directly. I think for us, we look at the items that we can control, our own capacity both for finished goods as well as for the subcomponents that come out of our fab and technology centers that feed our instrumentation. We look at our relationships with our suppliers, some of the engineering efforts that we have to quantify -- or to qualify new parts or secondary sources to open up new sources of supply. Those things are paying dividends for us and have contributed to the revenue performance that we've been able to deliver. And so, -- but as we look forward, and you asked specifically about the guide for the second half, we are still very much supply chain-constrained. And so, what that really bakes in is kind of our direct line of sight to delivery of the piece parts that we need to get products out the door and into the hands of our customers. It's a situation that's being very actively managed, but I think we're doing a good job of getting product into the hands of our customers on a time line that is acceptable to them.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Samik, this is Satish. Just to add on to what Neil mentioned. We have a very solid backlog position, over $2.4 billion. The demand continues to outpace supply. We know the challenges out there, but we feel very confident, and we're very prudent in our guide to ensure that we execute flawlessly. And we are continuing to be nimble and agile. And as Neil mentioned and I mentioned earlier, to execute to our commitments, we take it very seriously.
Operator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.
Meta Marshall: A couple of questions for me. One, OpEx. Despite the revenue, the OpEx kind of came in about as expected. And so, I just wanted to see how you guys are managing, either T&E coming back or just inflationary pressures on OpEx, and where you're kind of finding some of those efficiencies. And then, as a follow-up, you guys mentioned the new win in silicon photonics test. Obviously, it seems like a good long-term opportunity. Just time to ramp and whether you've already seen interest from other customers as you've kind of made progress in that? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: I'll take the first part of that, and then we'll let Satish or Mark address the silicon photonics part of the question. So, yes, with regard to the OpEx spending and the return of T&E and facilities costs, we didn't -- honest answer is, we did not see a lot of that in Q2, right? The Omicron spike, if you will, was kind of right in the middle of our second quarter, and we did not see any meaningful kind of return to -- of travel, entertainment and return to office. We have recently, more at the beginning of Q3, started to bring our employees back to our physical sites in . We are starting to see travel and entertainment not return to normal, but starting to reramp here more of a -- as more of a third quarter event. As regard to inflation, we're seeing cost of inflation in a number of different places across the P&L. And I think our action -- or our challenges with managing that is to capitalize on the differentiation that exists in our portfolio and look to monetize that where we can and continue to bring differentiated high software content solutions to the marketplace so that we can continue to manage that. I think if you look at the margin performance of the business, we're doing a good job to date managing those inflationary increases across the P&L.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Meta, I think if you look at the entire customer base of Keysight, the amount of inputs that we're getting for strong collaborations is at a record high. Customers deeper engagement with us, and they are -- very often are engaging us much earlier in the design cycle. So, we are very well positioned, given the strength of our relationships to be able to act on some of your inputs where it matches our strategy and continue to progress it. If I look at the semiconductor activity all the way from new silicon wafer starts to the cloud, there is a tremendous amount of designs that are occurring both from traditional players moving up the stack and from system players that want to verticalize and own the IP and well positioned to be working with all these customers across the wireless, wireline and even the fab to progress some of their strategies and enable them to be successful. And we're very pleased. I mean, the silicon photonic solution is very unique, it's an industry first, and we're very pleased with the design win we're getting because with each of these wins is a deeper collaboration to understand where the future is going and define it. Silicon photonics is one of the technologies that is seen as a possible solution to the high-throughput demands of a data center and cloud environment. So, it's another area where Keysight is opening up a new franchise, which will continue to position us for future growth.
Meta Marshall: Perfect. Congrats, guys. Thanks.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. You may proceed.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask about the backlog. I think the prepared remarks disclosed it to be $2.4 billion, which is roughly 45% of the current year revenue guide, and obviously, well above where it's been historically. So, based on guidance and the commentary around supply chain, it certainly does not sound like this backlog will be released to any capacity this year. So, I guess, my question is, how should we think about the cadence of this backlog release? Any color on the good duration or impact? Like, will we see it come through or will it just be kind of tapered in over many, many quarters? Any color there is helpful.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Well, first, you're absolutely right. We do not expect that we're going to reduce backlog at all this year. In fact, we would estimate in the current supply environment, which we expect to be challenging through the remainder of our fiscal year that we're going to continue to add to backlog. I think, how the backlog eventually winds its way from where -- from its current elevated levels to a more normalized level is really a function of how the broader supply chain situation resolves itself, right? And it's only educated guesses at this point because the honest answer is we don't know what that's going to look like. But I'm not expecting that there's going to be a step-function improvement across the supply chain that allows us to flush backlog over a one- or two-quarter period. I think it's going to be much more a function of us slowly bringing our quote and lead times on products down and slowly working that -- the backlog down to more normalized levels.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And we also view this as a favorable long-term trend for our business to enter a given quarter and having higher confidence in -- with the backlog. And as we think about the growing solutions that we're engaging with customers -- and these are deeper, longer-term relationships and they tend to give us very good visibility into our business. And we're pretty bullish by the growth prospects across the wireless, the wireline ecosystem, our industrial business. We have multiple vectors of growth around these big mega trends that is driving some of this backlog as well.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate that. So, then, for my next one, maybe I'll turn back and follow up on earlier commentary around the auto business. I understand from a high level, the Company is levered into really all the great secular trends in auto, whether it's battery R&D, charging infrastructure and autonomous. But I guess my question is, what's the biggest driver of this business? And is there anything we can track or monitor to just benchmark where growth could be here, whether that's like industry battery R&D spend, EV model proliferation? Just any help on how to think about -- like just kind of conceptualize the growth potential?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think at the simplistic level, we're tethered to the R&D spend that's occurring. And if you look at it, the entire ecosystem is spending to continually innovate on range autonomous capabilities. And it's a long-term driver. And if you look at the organic R&D investments being made by automakers, it's only poised to increase with time. So, I think that would be the closest external dynamic I would point to. I would also say, if you look back even a few years ago, the number of in-house labs to  and own generation of R&D from automakers was fairly sketchy, but we're starting to see more investment there across the world as more and more cars have more of these EV features driven by the bigger ESG goals and environment concerns around the world.
Mark Wallace: Hey Chris, this is Mark. I'll just add one thing to what Satish just said, and that's -- it makes it harder to track for you and for everyone. But there's so many different elements of what's happening with this transformation within the whole mobility space, whether it's the electrification of the drivetrain; the connectivity to the external network or communications within the vehicle, which we just announced some solutions to, to the charging infrastructure, which is being funded heavily by multiple nations as part of this transformation, to the millimeter wave and high-frequency technology around the sensors. It's just remarkable, the computational capabilities. And that's why this is such an important space to us is it intersects with all these areas of strength. And we continue to innovate with the industry leaders around all of the global ecosystems, as we said earlier. So, it's a long, long runway with all kinds of different elements of innovation.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.
Mehdi Hosseini: I have two follow-ups. I apologize if some of the questions have already been raised, since I joined the call late. One on the pricing dynamic, and I'm not asking for any quantitative color, but perhaps maybe you can explain to me on a qualitative basis. You are relatively more vertically integrated, and you have relatively more relationship with the strategic mission-critical customers. Are these two -- perhaps assuming lower input costs and higher relevancy to these mission-critical application, have they enabled you to extract more economics from your customers? And I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Mehdi, thank you for the question. Absolutely. I mean, you look at our focus around offering total solutions to customers, this has been our strategy since then, and that is really separating ourself. Our strategy is very clear. We look at some of the most tougher challenges in the industry that we serve, and we offer solutions. And by definition, it has higher software content. And over time, we've layered in services, which allows us to work with customers through their life cycle needs. All of that is favorable to our ability to continue to grow margins in the business and help offset some of the inflationary pricing pressures that we face.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. So, perhaps that's already reflected in your free cash flow margin that has been double digit. And I'm asking or raising this topic since the stock has been under pressure, and you've also been very active in buyback. Is there anything else with capital return that you're thinking of contemplating that would better reflect a company's ability to extract more economics and have a rather stable free cash flow? Like, would you favor paying more cash dividend rather than a buyback? And then, as a quick follow-up, has FX been dialed into your guide?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Mehdi. I think as you heard, multiple end-market exposures we have. And as you stated, towards many critical -- mission-critical applications, we're really bullish on the long-term opportunity at Keysight to create value. And so, congruent with that, we continue to be committed to this disciplined, balanced approach for capital allocation. First priority is obviously to invest for organic growth and differentiation, and we're seeing a lot of opportunities as we engage with our customers. Second, we are disciplined with M&A and -- but we're continuing to look for opportunities. We have a strong funnel, but we remain patient to make sure that it fits our hurdle as we have done in the past. And of course, it has to make sense for our strategy. And lastly, where we see opportunities, like the current situation, we believe that we will be more aggressive and take advantage of the return of capital through share buybacks as we have done this quarter. And we'll continue to remain on it. We have $600 million of previously authorized share buyback that we can still deploy, and we'll continue to deploy it as we see opportunities at these levels.
Neil Dougherty: And then, the second part of your question was have we accounted for FX in the guide. To the extent that FX has moved to date, yes, that's all baked into our guide. I had mentioned that it's about a 2 percentage-point headwind on a year-over-year basis in the second half. And relative to when we put out our original full year guide of 6% to 7% growth, there's an additional 1.5 points of unfavorable currency. So, we're raising from 6% to 7% all the  8%,  but there's an additional unfavorable 1.5 points of currency baked into that, again, based on rates as at today.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: I just have one question and that is, could you let us know a little bit about the software and services, specifically with some of these growing newer end markets like automotive and power? Is the attach rate and opportunity similar with the past? Less or more than what the past is for these newer end markets, again, services and software? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Jim. As we stated, as we are starting to go beyond the core products and that engineering teams use, which is lab instruments into more solutions, they have a higher weighted average of software and then greater ability to monetize through services. So, we're still very early innings in deploying those things. The latest ADE offering that we have, we're building it on top of our 5G platform, which is rich with software. But also as we expand into the application layer, as we bring more real-world challenges in the auto industry into the lab, we'll continue to see the opportunity be bigger over time, and we're investing to realize that.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.
Rob Mason: Satish, I'll just add my congratulations to your new role as well. My question was around the general electronics business. You did mention all-time record revenue there. And I was curious how the order rate performed in that piece of the business as well. I'm not sure I caught that. And then, just maybe related as well. Historically, kind of thought of the general electronics piece of the business as more PMI-sensitive. But, as you were describing that business, there seems like there's a lot of newer applications there. And I'm just curious if that's broadened out, how you're viewing that historical perspective, at least from perhaps a macroeconomic view to that part of the business.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. It's a great question. I'll have Mark answer the first part of it as to how we're doing with orders. But I'll say you're right. I mean, as we have -- when we started the company and when we thought about general electronics business had a bigger correlation to manufacturing customer base. And over time, we've been adding more R&D applications and focus to the team as it has been able to bring in some newer end-market applications, such as digital health and IoT. And it continues to move up the value chain with our customers. So, over time, we would expect it to continue to be more in that direction. Another area of focus for that group is also around advanced research. As I noted, we had some announcements with the Singapore -- with a university in Singapore around quantum. We also had a major win in terahertz research associated with that business. So, we continue to ensure that we're seeking more value-added, sustainable, durable opportunities in that business, but that business historically has had a little bit more manufacturing exposure than the rest. So, I'll just hand over to Mark to speak about...
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Satish. Yes. Rob, we saw some moderating order growth during the quarter, mainly because of some softness in education. With some of the delays to the government spending and some of the other priorities that have come upon the funding, we did see some softness there. But we saw a lot of new customers in growth from R&D solutions for digital healthcare. We've added nearly 500 new customers again in the quarter, which helps to diversify our base and represents this broad base of industries across multiple segments and so forth. We saw strong demand continue across Asia with several new wins around the R&D solutions. And as Satish just mentioned, there have been some real bright spots around advanced research with our university. So, GDP markets are affected more or less with some of the activities in the geopolitical situation, which I think translates to some of the moderating growth we saw. But all in all, we see a continued demand for some of our advanced R&D solutions.
Rob Mason: Sure. That's great color. Just as a quick follow-up, maybe for Neil. The -- is there anything, Neil, that you would call out that we should be monitoring around our margin assumptions as you convert some of the backlog just, again, taking your commentary around rising inflation, just how your -- how we should look at the price-cost dynamic within your backlog?
Neil Dougherty: I mean, the backlog -- the biggest issue there is the backlog does create a little bit of a delay between the time at which we might impact a price increase and the time at which that price increase would be recognized in revenue, whereas it seems like on the input cost side, the cost increases are much more real time, particularly if you want to secure delivery of product. And so, that mismatch is something we're very actively managing, but it can cause some quarter-to-quarter perturbations if the timing gets off. But I think, generally speaking, we're doing a good job of managing in this inflationary environment and protecting margins.
Operator: The next question is from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Good afternoon. Great quarter, guys. Quick one on M&A. On M&A, have you seen any softening in seller expectations?
Neil Dougherty: Not a lot yet. Obviously, we've seen the market pullbacks, but seller expectations still seem to be kind of linked to prior valuations. So, we're watching that closely and very actively managing our funnel, staying disciplined with regard to our return hurdles and hoping that we get the opportunity to act on some of these targets. But right now, there does seem to be a little bit of a mismatch there.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. And then, sorry, if you’ve fleshed this out, but what was the Russia impact, Neil?
Neil Dougherty: We -- it's about 2 points. So, core order growth within the quarter was 11. Adjusted for Russia, it was 13. We canceled low-$20 million kind of backlog for Russia. It has historically been a 1% business for us.
Operator: There are no additional questions at this time. I will now pass it back to the management team for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Well, thank you, Tia, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences, and wish you a great day.
Operator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines.

Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a strong start to the year. First quarter results are evidence that our broad-based portfolio of differentiated solutions is aligned with the market's most important design and test challenges. We are enabling our customers to address rapidly evolving technologies and market opportunities.  Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we continue to see sustained robust demand with record orders again exceeding our expectations. Growth in the quarter was broad-based and balanced across our diverse set of end markets and across all regions. Orders grew 22% year-over-year and were 31% higher than the first quarter of 2020, just prior to the initial impact of the COVID pandemic.  Second, record first quarter revenue and earnings per share exceeded the high end of our guidance despite ongoing supply constraints. Our results and exceptional execution by the Keysight team continue to demonstrate the durability and resilience of our business.  And third, Keysight solutions are aligned with the long-term secular trends fueled by ongoing innovation across multiple markets. Our investments in growth initiatives and supply chain resiliency are paying off. We continue to expect to deliver 6% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and given the stronger-than-guided first quarter earnings, to achieve 12% earnings growth. We are confident in the strength of the company we built and our ability to drive above-market profitable growth over the long term.  Accordingly, with the recent equity market volatility, we capitalized on the opportunity to create value for shareholders by accelerating our share repurchases in the past 2 quarters.  Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered another quarter of record orders, which grew 22% to $1.5 billion. This outpaced record first quarter revenue, which grew 6% to $1.25 billion. We achieved gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 28% and EPS of $1.65, all of which were first quarter records. Although supply constraints continue to moderate revenue, Keysight's consistent execution and focus on growth initiatives across the 5G ecosystem, automotive and software position us well to capitalize on a robust demand environment.  The Electronics Industrial Solutions Group delivered double-digit order and revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. Record orders were driven by strong demand for automotive and semiconductor solutions as well as broad general electronic applications. Our differentiated solutions position us well to win in the fast-expanding automotive market, where we achieved all-time record orders and record first quarter revenue. Orders grew well over 50% in the quarter and exceeded 50% growth over the past year.  Manufacturing capacity continued to expand to meet pent-up demand, and the EV and AV technology investment accelerated. This happened particularly in Europe and China, where EV market share of total car sales in 2021 increased to 19% and 15%, respectively. Demand remains strong from leading manufacturers for both EV and AV production test solutions, power semiconductors, automotive electronics and RF and millimeter wave wireless test.  Keysight continues to engage with global industry leaders such as BMW, Sony Semiconductor Solutions and Proventia to enable next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D and production workflows. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove double-digit order and revenue growth and resulted in record orders and record first quarter revenue. Investments remain high in advanced semiconductor technologies and capacity expansion to serve a broad set of applications, including silicon-rich smartphones, high-performance computing, IoT and autos.  In general electronics, we achieved record orders with double-digit growth across all regions driven by investment in manufacturing and device development for consumer and industrial IoT, digital health, connectivity and remote monitoring.  Turning to the Communications Solutions Group. We delivered record first quarter orders and revenue with double-digit order growth across all regions. Commercial communications orders achieved the second-highest quarter on record with double-digit order and revenue growth in the Americas and Europe.  We see continued strength in 400G and 800G Ethernet solutions for enterprise and service provider customers as well as increasing demand for terabit communication solutions. Driven by the ongoing investment in data center and cloud applications, orders for Keysight's differentiated, high-performance, real-time oscilloscopes grew triple digits this quarter. Keysight's leadership in 5G Release 16 applications, broad test case coverage and our strategic role in O-RAN are enabling our expansion across the broad communications ecosystem.  Our 5G customer base is growing as deployments begin to scale, and we are enabling disruptive technologies with key industry players, such as Qualcomm to demonstrate 3.5-gigabit uplink data throughput, Chunghwa Telecom in Taiwan to accelerate verification of O-RAN connectivity, KT Corporation in South Korea to verify advanced 5G new radio features and LG Electronics to demonstrate 6G radio frequencies. Investments remain strong in 5G wireless R&D and manufacturing as well as networking as market expansion transitions to devices, network equipment and the aerospace, defense vertical.  In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by demand for signal monitoring, cyber, space and satellite as well as 5G and 6G applications. Demand was particularly strong in Asia Pacific and Europe. As design, test and measurement solutions grow in complexity, software and services are an increasingly more important differentiator for Keysight. Combined, they represented more than 1/3 of total revenue this quarter, increasing recurring revenue and contributing to the resiliency and predictability of our business.  In summary, demand remains strong for Keysight's software-centric portfolio of differentiated solutions across all of our end markets and regions. Since the pandemic began in 2020, Keysight has been focused on supporting our customers and delivering on our commitments. We have implemented new sourcing strategies and increased partner engagement to improve supply chain flexibility, diversification and resilience. While fully focused on our near-term priorities, we continue to work towards a long-term sustainable vision for the company and for the communities in which we operate.  The Keysight leadership model drives us to deliver business value through ethical, environmentally sustainable and socially responsible operations. Corporate social responsibility is an enabling value of the KLM, and we are proud to have been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third year in a row.  Keysight's inclusion exemplifies the company's continued commitment to building a better planet. This includes ambitious targets that support several UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as our commitment to achieve net-zero emissions in our company operations by fiscal year 2040, 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement goal of 2050. As we accelerate innovation to connect and secure the world, we are better positioned than ever to deliver value to our customers, shareholders and employees.  Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Q1 was a great start to fiscal 2022, and our full year outlook exemplifies Keysight's ability to deliver on our commitments.  In the first quarter of 2022, we delivered revenue of $1.250 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 7% on a core basis. As expected, supply chain constraints continue to temper revenue results. We delivered a record $1.495 billion in orders, up 22% or 23% on a core basis. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in backlog.  Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $473 million, resulting in an operating margin of 28%. We achieved net income of $305 million and delivered $1.65 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 184 million shares.  Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $878 million, up 3% on both the reported and core basis. CSG delivered record gross margin of 67% and operating margin of 27%. In Q1, commercial communications generated revenue of $584 million, up 5%, with double-digit revenue growth in the Americas and Europe driven by continued investments in 5G, O-RAN adoption, 400-gigabit, 800-gigabit and terabit R&D and wireline applications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $294 million was flat versus a strong prior year compare.  Solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the Americas and Europe. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in aerospace, defense and government, and the funnel remains strong for this end market.  The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated first quarter revenue of $372 million, up 13% or 15% on a core basis, driven by strong revenue growth in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 31%.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $224 million and free cash flow of $182 million or 15% of revenue. Under the new share repurchase authorization announced in November of last year, we have acquired 1.13 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $182.19 for a total consideration of $206 million.  Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Demand remains strong for Keysight Solutions. However, supply constraints continue to moderate shipments. We expect second quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.310 billion and Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.63 to $1.69 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 183 million shares. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we continue to expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% while delivering 12% earnings growth. The raised EPS growth expectation reflects ours higher-than-expected Q1 earnings.  In closing, the demand environment remains strong across our end markets and regions. With a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence, we are confident in our ability to meet our customer commitments and continue to deliver profitable above-market growth going forward.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Elliott, will you please go ahead and give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: . And the first question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays.
Timothy Long: I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the 5G end market maybe as it cuts across your business. Could you talk about kind of the revenue order momentum there and maybe touch on some of the newer areas? I think you mentioned O-RAN, but could you talk O-RAN private networks millimeter waves, some of the newer areas that are contributing to growth there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Tim, this is Satish. We have another strong quarter in our commercial communications business driven by 5G and all the wireline evolutions. Specific to 5G, I think as I've stated before, we see near-term and medium-term catalysts that remain intact. If you look at it more near term, I would say, the ongoing global deployments that are scaling continue to drive demand in both R&D and manufacturing offerings. Specific to R&D, the Release 16 is really aimed at some of these new use cases with industrial applications and private networks in particular. Longer term, we remain bullish about millimeter wave and its adoption. But in the medium term, the applications such as O-RAN are really growing the ecosystem of opportunities for us. in We just added over 100 new customers into our 5G platform in the most recent quarter. So very strong growth in the 5G applications for sure across both R&D and manufacturing and deployments and across the globe. So broad strength.
Timothy Long: Okay. I'm sorry, if I could just follow up. It sounds like you've already had a few 6G announcements. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the cadence of when you think that rollout start to impact this business? Is this still a few years out? Or are you starting to see some real traction with some of the larger players in the industry?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We're still -- if you look at it from a standards perspective, we're still in Release 16. Release 17 is just getting started, and you've got Release 18 being planned. So there's still considerable time to go with 5G evolution. That will continue for quite some time. But the industry is also looking at what's the next wave of innovations, 6G on the wireless side. On the wireline side, terabit Ethernet is definitely an area where there's a lot of advanced research happening both on the wireless and wireline side. And Keysight, given our strong strategy of focus on building out the workflow for the communication cycle system, we're engaged in those advanced research discussions with multiple consortiums around the globe. And we've already started to get some early research business, which positions us for continued leadership over time.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan.
Samik Chatterjee: I guess I'm just trying to get some help in understanding the divergence here between the order growth and the revenue outlook. This is, I think, the fourth quarter where you've expanded orders by more than 20% year-on-year. And when we look at the revenue outlook, obviously, that's materially below that. How should we think about it? Sort of is there more of unwind into the revenue or some realization of revenue or supply chain eases? Or is that -- is the order strength driven by a lot of early ordering or sort of long-dated orders?  And in particular, if I can just ask one follow-up there. If -- how are we thinking about the same divergence between ADG and UC remaining flat for the last couple of quarters versus what you talked about in terms of strong order increase?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil. So I think, first of all, I would say that the order growth, we believe, is indicative of the highly -- or the very strong demand environment we're seeing across the wide range of end markets, right? Within EISG, the semi auto market is very strong. The surge in manufacturing driving strength in general electronics. In the communications side, we're seeing great strength in 5G, as Satish just talked about, but also 400 gigabit, 800 gigabit on the networking side as well. And so very strong demand, and I think that's reflected in the order strength and in the growth you're seeing in orders. On the revenue side, obviously, we continue to work through significant supply chain challenges. Our revenue is significantly constrained by the supply environment, and we're working through that. We have said on prior calls that we have seen lead times to our customers extend by about a month, and that month extension has really happened over the course of the last 2 years, really from the onset of COVID back in the spring of 2020. And I think the good news is that our customers have responded to that and are placing orders with Keysight a bit earlier so that they can still get product delivery on a time line that meets their needs. And I think we're doing a good job getting product into the hands of our customers on those time lines. I think if you turn the lens forward, what you're going to see as the supply chain situation starts to improve, and we hope to see that beginning in the second half. But certainly, we expect to see some supply chain constraints through 2023, that our lead times will slowly start to migrate back in over a number of quarters. And similarly, our customers will once again readjust their ordering patterns to, again, align them with their own need for delivery. Why don't I turn it back to Mark for some more comments on the demand side.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Neil. I think you covered it well. I just would add that -- reiterating the demand remains strong. It was very strong in Q1, very broad. We saw some earlier orders placed in distribution as an example, where the channel inventories are low because of the demand that we've seen there. So that's to be expected. We also saw some early orders from semiconductor, which is typical. They have longer-term horizons, and we work with them in that fashion. But the headline is our strong double-digit order growth. It was not an outcome of advanced purchases. And on the plus side, as Neil mentioned, we are now working with customers much earlier than we may have done in the past. We've always had deep relationships. But the outcome is we're getting better visibility to their forecast and their forward-looking plans, which I think will sustain for the long term.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.
Meta Marshall: Maybe following up on Samik's question. Just in terms of supply chain, would you say that conditions largely stayed the same in fiscal Q1 over fiscal Q4? Or was there any kind of material tightening that you saw kind of in any of the categories? Just trying to get a sense of whether it remains constrained or whether you started to see some improvement or worsening. And then maybe second question. Obviously, we've seen some valuation rerating on the software side of stocks. And so just wondering if anything becomes more attractive from an M&A environment just as some of these valuations reset.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil again. So first of all, with regard to the supply chain situation, I think it's safe to say that we didn't see things materially get better within the quarter. I don't think they got worse. I would call it largely the same. I think we continue to look forward to some relaxation in the second half, and that's still our expectation. But we did not see any acceleration or early signs that that's happening. It's still our expectation, but largely unchanged within the quarter on the supply chain side.
Ronald Nersesian: And Meta, this is Ron. With regard to software valuations, obviously, you're exactly correct. The IPE software companies, we've seen the valuations come down. But realistically, when we talk to companies and they've seen -- when they see a pullback, they still view their old share price as the price that the company should get a premium to. It normally takes about a year. It depends company by company before they would go ahead and sell at a lesser value. But we're highly engaged at looking at opportunities, looking at things that make sense. And we have a very active funnel right now, including software.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: I was hoping you could comment a little bit more on the P&L outlook for next quarter. Revenue guidance is up sequentially. EPS is relatively flattish quarter-on-quarter. So maybe you can bridge us from some higher revenue. And what's leading to the more flat quarter-on-quarter EPS?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I'll take that one as well. So as we look forward into the second quarter, we do see, as you look at scheduled shipments, some unfavorable mix on a sequential basis as well as kind of continuing impact from other inflationary elements, most notably expediting fees and other things are continuing to impact gross margins. And I think the other thing is we are continuing to ramp kind of back into our targeted levels of R&D. We were actually sub-15% in Q4, approaching 16% here in Q1 as we look to kind of mid-16% of revenue is more the level. So I'd expect some further increase in that rate of investment in the R&D side of things as well, which is what's leading to the more or less flattish EPS.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful. And for my follow-up question was on the comms segment. The company is focused and done a very good job broadening out the exposure into various ways, right, in terms of the type of tests you're doing but also the various parts of the industry. And 400 and 800, you guys have been going for some time. So maybe you can level set us on how big 400 and 800G is and how much data center is contributing to that comms segment at this point.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I'll take this. I think you're right. I mean our strategy to really connect the workflow across the communications ecosystem continues to play out, and our execution remains very strong. At the heart of it, we've been focused on connecting the workflow between the wireless and the wireline parts of the ecosystem. And we see that all of the data that comes through the networks through 5G, as an example, have to ultimately flow into a data center or cloud. And so as we follow that trial end-to-end, we see significant upgrades happening across the entire communications design flow. And we're participating in a number of those technology trends associated with not only the speed because you referenced with 400, 800 and terabit but also the underlying infrastructure that's changing with the memories, the server technologies and the edge compute as well. And we're also very pleased with the number of new chipset starts, the design starts that are occurring across the entire industry today. And all of this is contributing to strength, and we saw that reflected in our commercial communications business, where we maintain a good balance between the 5G growth and also the wireline evolutions growth.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.
James Suva: Congratulations. I just have one question. There's been a lot of news about new building of semiconductor equipment factories and a lot more of like automobiles being more electronics. Given the large long supply chain, I'm just kind of curious, are those big orders already coming into your company? Or since they have to pour concrete and walls, would those be much more long-dated and not even in your orders at this point? Because it seems like those are long-term multiyear products -- projects that will actually extend much more beyond the typical horizon where people may think that we're kind of at the peak of orders right now, which I potentially could disagree with.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Jim, this is Mark. I'll take that. And you're exactly right. The strength that we're seeing today and have been seeing for the last many quarters is around new process technology development and mature technology scaling. But what you're referring to is the global expansion of new fabs in North America, in the United States, in parts of Asia and across Europe. These are multiyear, multibillion-dollar investments that the semiconductor leaders are making, and the vast majority of those investments are well in front of us.
Neil Dougherty: I'd just remind -- and then I'd just remind everybody of our order acceptance policy. We generally don't put an order on the books unless it's shippable within a 6-month period of time. And so those orders for those longer things -- well, in some cases, those customers are giving us visibility to their needs for these future factories and fabs that are going into place. They are not reflected in orders as of today.
Mark Wallace: Yes. I'll just follow up just to emphasize that. We are talking to all of the semiconductor players and we are working through the planning and preparation for the future. But as Neil said, what we booked today is really based on demand that we can see going out 6 months.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS.
Christopher Snyder: I guess my first question is kind of bigger picture. Clearly, the industry is in the middle of a very strong period of demand. The orders were up against sequentially here, the slight negative seasonality. So I guess my question is kind of what pushes the industry back down towards that normalized 3% to 5% growth that Keysight has called out in the past? And is it fair to think that the industry kind of collectively can achieve outsized growth until 5G peaks?
Mark Wallace: So Chris, this is Mark. I'll take a stab at that. I think the success that we've achieved and the level of order growth is tied into a lot about what Satish has been talking about, which is connecting our customers' workflows, even goes back to the previous question as it pertains to the growth in semiconductor being fed into demands from multiple different industries all bringing more electronic content together. So that has this compounding effect. I certainly think that as we get to the maturity with some of these technologies, the capacities will meet certain levels so we can see some of that begin to -- the growth begin to turn more to more long-term models that we've been seeing. But as we do so, we look forward to the next generation. And as also we mentioned earlier, the early research that's occurring around 6G and the participation that we have given our leadership position in the market gives us opportunities to continue to drive this high secular growth that we've been delivering for several quarters.
Ronald Nersesian: And the -- Chris, the 3% to 5% that you're talking about that's for the market, we have clearly done a pretty good job of growing faster than the market quarter after quarter, and we intend to do so going forward. But look at the convergence in semiconductors and how more and more functions are being integrated into semiconductors and everything, whether you're talking about IoT or any of these other apps that we talk about, that demand we're going to see for a long period of time. Look at automotive. We're not talking about things that will grow for a year or 2. Even though we talk about 19% and 15% of the total market being effectively EV in Europe and Asia, I mean, that's going to go up close to 100%. And then we have the Americas, too, which is behind. 5G has a ton of runway. And then following that, where we're starting to see early investments in talking is 6G that will follow it. On top of that, you put quantum. So the use of high-performance electronics is not rolling over, and we don't see that at all in any short- or medium-term situation. And whatever the market growth rate, Keysight's aspirations, goals and results have always been to outgrow the market.
Christopher Snyder: Yes. No, I appreciate that. It just feels like so many of the drivers here are secular. That's what I was trying to kind of figure out what pushes this back down to mid-single-digit growth. And you kind of touched on my follow-up. The company has significantly outgrew the market and taken a lot of share ever really since you spun out, but it feels like it's kind of accelerated here. Is there anything that could cause that to compress?
Ronald Nersesian: If we were at 65%, 70% share, you could say, "Oh, will it start to flatten out?" We're at roughly 25% market share in total. We have so much headroom. I mean the market is 4x the size of Keysight, and we're gaining share. We're investing as much as that's needed. We're investing more than anyone else in the industry. We're investing earlier in the cycles for new developments, and we have the credibility with these players to be the chosen partner. And now that we've expanded beyond hardware to hardware to software and services, we provide complete solutions which makes our customers' lives easier. And we help them accelerate their innovation time line. So I'm very bullish on this, and I know the whole team is also.
Christopher Snyder: If I just -- really quickly on that last point, has the -- the industry has accelerated towards software. Do you think that has been a driver of maybe accelerate share gains for Keysight just given your capacity to invest in whether it's organic or M&A relative to a lot of your smaller competitors?
Ronald Nersesian: No. I think there is opportunity for us to grow software, and we are. And we've seen that since we launched the company more than double that business, and there's a lot more headroom there. But we see it in a lot of the technologies that are also down in the physical layer where you need both. You need the ability to acquire the signal in a very high-fidelity way at very, very high performance when we're talking millimeter wave and up to terabit, plus you need the analysis capability that's in firmware and then software. And these are complex problems. You need service and support from people that are qualified to put this all together. And Keysight has all of that. And that's been a real, real advantage for us, and we continue to see that as we continue to expand our investments and our programs in each of these areas.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.
Matthew Niknam: Just two, if I could. First, on the U.S. Maybe if you can talk about what drove the sequential downtick in U.S. -- or Americas revenue this quarter. I think you'd called out the softness in aerospace, defense. Just curious if that was more tied to supply chain or demand-related. And then we think CSG, gross margins are actually improved about 120 bps sequentially, even though revenues actually were down sequentially. And I think last quarter, you had messaged some initial expectations that there would be more of a negative mix shift in this fiscal quarter. So I'm just wondering maybe what drove some of the outperformance there.
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I think if you really want to figure out what's going on in the marketplace, orders is the best indicator. And I know some companies don't report orders with as much detail, but we want to give you as much insight as we can. So if you look at the revenue numbers. Sales may not be commensurate with what's going on in the market. In the Americas, for instance, we were up 23%. Now if per chance, because we're not shipping everything and we're building backlog, which is an incredible position at almost $2.4 billion, that just means we're going to produce a lot more profit later when we clear that out. But the market performance is very strong. And as we continue to improve the supply chain, you'll see the revenue get a chance to work that backlog out over time.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, with regards to the gross margin, you're right, we had a higher software mix this quarter as we continue to progress our strategy of software-centric solutions. And from the aerospace and defense perspective, while the defense budget has been cut in the Americas -- in the U.S., we are waiting on the consortiums through the appropriations process that's currently underway, which is expected to occur somewhere between March and April time frame. That should allow for increased program spend for rest of the year and the following year. But if you look at just the aerospace and defense order growth, to the point that Ron made, continues to grow strongly and our multiyear programs remain intact.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson, Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Congrats on another strong quarter. First question, I wanted to ask about just at a high level, what kind of inflation are you seeing? And then how is the pricing environment? How does the -- how does that paradigm work for Keysight?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So sorry, turn on my microphone, it would help. We are seeing inflation across a number of different areas within the supply chain -- or within the cost structure. I think as we noted last quarter, certainly, labor is one of those. We had our largest salary increase cycle in the fall in our 7-year history as an independent company. Certainly, in certain aspects of the supply chain, we are seeing various levels of price increases. Freight and logistics, clearly an area where we're seeing costs go up. Even those companies that maybe aren't raising prices as aggressively are sometimes paying or charging for expedited shipments or to get your spot in line. And so we're seeing it in a number of different places. And I think as far as our own pricing, I think we're constantly trying to balance our competitive situation with what we're seeing on the cost side and working to maintain margins as much as possible. And I think we've done a good job of doing that so far and would expect to going forward.
Ronald Nersesian: When we -- if you take a look at this when we launched the company, we were at roughly 56% gross margin, and now we're talking 66% from software, from our hardware differentiation, from leadership positions in 5G, which gives us the opportunity to do a little bit of value pricing. And we're going to continue to work to drive that higher.
Adam Thalhimer: And then, Ron, just real quickly, you mentioned that orders came in above expectations. Can you give a little color as to what was stronger?
Mark Wallace: Yes. Adam, this is Mark. The strengths, as we said before, are really broad-based. All regions were double-digit order growth. 2 of the 4 regions -- or 2 of the 3 regions were record high. We saw double-digit order growth across all of the end segments as well. We added just over 500 new customers to Keysight during the quarter. We've done that every quarter, adding hundreds of new customers across all the different end markets around all the geographies. That's really important to us. That helps us diversify our business and grow our base, and our business to the base is up very strong double digits as well.  So we are really working hard, as I mentioned before, to align our plans with our market-leading customers where we've done very well. And we're also adding new customers and growing the long tail of small- and medium-sized businesses as well. So very, very broad strengths around all the regions and all the end segments.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: As supply chain issues ease, how much of a margin benefit could there be? I imagine in addition to the higher freight costs and so on you're carrying now, there's also some manufacturing inefficiencies just related to the component shortages.
Neil Dougherty: It's not obvious to me that there's going to be a margin benefit other than volume that comes from a relaxation of the supply chain environment. I think our factories are continuing to run pretty efficiently. I think we'll need to take a wait-and-see approach, but it's not obvious to me that it's going to be a big margin benefit other than the benefits of volume.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And are there any data points you can give us around sort of the internal initiatives you've got, new sourcing partners, other things that you're doing to remove some of the supply chain bottlenecks? And just to check, it doesn't sound like Omicron had much of an impact to you incrementally in the quarter?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So no incremental impact. Obviously, the constraints in the supply chain are broad, and I think you're hearing this across multiple industries as well, and we feel that. But with regard to the actions that we're taking to maximize, those include internal value engineering activities to find multiple sources for products, looking for alternate sourcing from the open markets. We have strong collaborations with a number of our strategic silicon or semiconductor suppliers and our customers, too. So when we look at the end-markets demand for Keysight products around 5G, automotive and semiconductor, we have strong engagements with customers and our supply chain so that we're able to coordinate this. And at this point, as Neil mentioned earlier, that we're able to meet our customers' needs a very high percentage of the time. So we're very confident on our ability to process this backlog and convert it into revenue in future quarters. And pending upside from any improvement in the supply chain, we could further accelerate.
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird.
Robert Mason: I just wanted to ask about the automotive market. A number of comments around how strong that has been for you and the long runway that exists there. Question is, how do you view that market's growth rate over the next few years? And then since it is that the EV and ADAS elements of that market are newer for test and measurement -- high-end test and measurement, I'm curious how you think about your mix evolving into that market between R&D and production test or manufacturing tests.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So I'd say that when we look at the automotive market, as Ron referenced in his script that we see a real inflection in adoption of EV and then a subsequent simultaneous adoption for AV as well, really driving the needs of the automotive market. At a simplistic level, we see a number of new lab activities that are starting in R&D across the globe, where automotive customers traditionally outsourced a lot of the R&D work, but they are now starting to build new facilities for research and development, hiring of electrical engineering talent, hiring of software talent is increasing, and that's really reflected in our R&D business that continues to grow strongly. We see this continuing to be a secular growth driver for us. With regard to the manufacturing expansion, as you saw the number of EV starts to increase, our manufacturing business in this market also continues to grow. So at this point, I would say the opportunities for us -- for Keysight is to expand with a number of new lab starts as the hiring of electrical engineers growth in the automotive market will continue to grow.  But we also have the opportunity to increase our solutions content in display. And some of the acquisitions that we have made enables us to play strongly into the battery test and charging arena. And so we're positioning ourselves there, along with the C-V2X stack that we've invested in with our 5G portfolio that allows us to get into this marketplace. In the most recent quarter, we've basically announced at CES the radar scene emulator solution, which again, got a lot of active interest from our customers. So automotive continues to be the area of investment for us. And it's really hard to predict the growth rate, but we're quite pleased with the very strong results we're seeing so far. I'll just hand it off to Mark to make some comments on the funnel.
Mark Wallace: Yes. I was going to mention the radar scene emulator. You got that Satish. The funnel is very strong. It's growing. We're seeing a lot of customers look out to Keysight for both EV and AV expertise. You think about all of the changes that are occurring within the customer base as well as the new entrants coming in, dealing with millimeter wave, dealing with high-power semiconductors, charging infrastructure, all of this stuff that we are providing leading solutions to. So that funnel is growing substantially. The other indicator that I think is very positive is the adoption of our services, which again is another indicator that customers are looking for help in innovating and getting these tough jobs done. So we're attaching a lot more services to our solutions, especially in the EV and the AV space.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Elliott. Now I'll turn it over to Ron to wrap this up for today. Thank you for joining.
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As you can probably tell, we are very pleased with what our team has done to produce consistently excellent results. But I would also love to add that we are very optimistic for Keysight not only in the short term but with the position that we are in for long-term shareholder value creation. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. Today, I’ll focus my comments on four key headlines: First, demand for Keysight’s differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021. Third, we entered 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past seven years of investment in transformation has only grown stronger. Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for value-creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. Now, let’s take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share. Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended the year with 17% revenue growth and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of $6.23 per share. Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15% respectively over this two-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base. We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model. Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in both business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue, driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion to address pent-up demand. In automotive, we achieved record orders for the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the collaboration with NIO, one of China’s top EV automakers who selected Keysight’s 5G and C-V2X network emulation solutions. Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industrial 4.0 and advanced academic research. The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions. Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new industry applications. In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit order growth in network test and visibility. In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments in technology with the focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for aerospace and defense applications. Keysight’s first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning engagement with industrial leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google’s cloud partner initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications. We continue to accelerate Keysight’s capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions and recently added SCALABLE Network Technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio. SCALABLE is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication networks and cyber threats for aerospace, defense and government customers. We’re excited to welcome the SCALABLE team to Keysight. Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers’ wallet share. In fiscal year 2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced Keysight’s overall growth. Combined, they represented just over one-third of Keysight’s total revenue for the year. We also continue to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight’s margin expansion. Keysight’s focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drive our consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since our inception as a public company seven years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly 1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth, all while significantly increasing investment in R&D and sales to drive future growth. Over the same period, we have nearly tripled the size of our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These accomplishments are a testament to Keysight’s leadership model, our values and our people. I would like to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize on these multiple ways of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained above-market profitable growth. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy Thanksgiving.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1,294 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment. The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses. With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1,491 million in orders, up 21% on a reported and core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the supply chain situation improves. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high. Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%. Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year results. In FY21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, two years ahead of plan. FY21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% of non-GAAP net income. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchase for the year to approximately 4.4 million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free cash flow. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares. Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with increasing capacity and technology investments. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy. In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence. We’re encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Katherine, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan.
Joe Cardoso: Hi. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. My first question is just around the full year guide. So, you’re guiding the full year to 6% to 7% growth, and I’m just trying to flip that with your commentary last quarter around -- expectations around a more muted seasonality. First of all, does that expectation still stand true? And if so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal ‘21, or is there something I’m not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Hi, Samik. It’s a great question. So, yes, as we mentioned on the call, we did see the supply chain situation tightened during the quarter, and our guidance does assume that we will see some relaxation in that environment in the back half of the year. So, if I was thinking about the seasonality for FY22, I’d say two things. I think, first of all, I think we’d expect revenue to build as we move throughout the year. And then, maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year. I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I’d be expecting growth rates in the first half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are slightly above that 6% to 7% level, so that we average that for the full year.
Joe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color there. And then, just on my second question, EISG posted record operating margin this quarter. They were really strong. Just curious to hear what were some of the big drivers or contributors to the margin there relative to operating margins? And just curious to hear if there was any onetime benefits in the quarter that we should consider?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. No onetime benefits, but I mean I think the thing that comes immediately to the forefront is obviously the extraordinarily strong revenue growth for the year with 30% revenue growth on the year. The business -- the demand for those products has been very strong. We’ve seen a very nice rebound this year in the automotive business, the semi business, we all have -- everybody has seen the press on the continued strength in semi. So, you take that strong demand picture and -- which essentially allowed them to leverage their OpEx infrastructure and drive really high levels of operating margin in the short run. I think as we look forward, we continue to see great opportunities to continue to grow the business as well as to invest in further technology investments to serve these end markets.
Operator: The next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Neil, I wonder if you could just dig a little bit deeper into kind of some of the supply constraints that you’re seeing out there. I think you said in your prepared comments, it’s hitting you guys, EISG stronger than comms. I’m kind of curious, is this logistical constraints? Is it component constraints? Is it a little bit of everything? And is there a dollar amount you can give us that impacted revenue, both in the fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal first quarter?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Thanks, John. It’s a great question. So, first of all, I said the opposite. The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so, there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think, it’s also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so, there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG. I think, if you think about the impact of supply chain, I’d maybe lump COVID and supply chain together because we’ve really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you’re starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I’d really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter, but over time you’re looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There’s typically a little bit of a lag at certain percentage of each quarter’s order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and in 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so, I think we estimate that if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so, I think that’s the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog, once the supply chain situation fixes itself. I don’t expect that we’ll flush that in a quarter or two. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are going to happen over time as well. But, that’s the rough magnitude of what we’ve -- what the impact has been here over a couple of year period of time.
John Pitzer: That’s really helpful color. And then, Ron, over the last several years, we, on this side of the world, have been trying to compare and contrast sort of the 5G rollout with the 4G rollout relative to your business. And I guess, what I was hoping to do is get a little bit more color about the software strategy you’re deploying this time around, which seems like an incremental driver. I’m just kind of curious, can you size the potential TAM opportunity that gives you, especially as the network more from just being a backbone for handsets and mobile to actually being a backbone for a lot of new incremental applications. And to the extent that software and services is a third of the business now, sort of how do we think about that over like the next three to five years?
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, John. It’s very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric solution provider and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we’ve seen great growth obviously in our software and our services, and they’ve outpaced the hardware growth. Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made a decision in 2013, we announced at Agilent, we’re going to spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders. In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let’s say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So, we invested earlier. We invested a greater amount as now we’re roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately 12% of R&D. And we’ve gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this period of time, but software is a key part. What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into one organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them over to 5G. And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the leading provider for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years. I’m going to turn it over to Satish, who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in, not only 2021, but what he sees going forward.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thank you, Ron. Great question. I think at the summary, we’ve had another record quarter for 5G and the drivers are scaling deployments, but equally important is the new application space. And I think we outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application, and this application area is very rich, right? As I look forward, some of these application spaces have software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue very actively. I’ll just make a few examples of these, right? So, you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great example of that. On the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex. You look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASE and MACsec and the security domain. So, you look at the commercial comms portfolio, it’s very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more software-centric and one we’re investing to pursue, and we’re generating strong results.
Jason Kary: We are ready for the next question from Jim Suva of Citibank.
Jim Suva: I had a thought about your vertical integration. You’re a lot more vertically integrated than the other companies. Has that materially benefited you during the supply chain bottlenecks, or are there like little things, whether it be plastics or connector or housing that held you back just as much as the other? And I’m just trying to think about does this now cause you to even want to be a little bit more vertically integrated, or how core are you at the sweet spot of your vertical integration? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, Jim. The first thing that’s probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab makes gallium arsenide and indium phosphide semiconductors. So, a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built. And we build a lot of those custom components in-house. So, that has definitely helped us. Now, again, if you don’t have all the parts, you can’t ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape compared to other competitors, but there’s no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the components that are needed in order to ship the product. We always will look for opportunities to integrate, provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It’s not so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components, but there is the whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So, we are impacted, a little bit less than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during these very challenging times.
Jim Suva: Great. Thank you. Congratulations to you and your team at Keysight.
Jason Kary: Great. And the next question goes to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Some of the defense primes have spoken to slowing Department of Defense budget outlays, and I appreciate that Keysight reported broad-based order strength. But, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more on what you’re seeing in your AD&G segment? And if you are experiencing any slower end market trends, even if in certain portions of that business segment?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So, again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it’s recovery in the macro environment globally, similar spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally and one we’re capturing. We also took some concerted steps last year or two years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace, defense applications, and as you’ve probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced. So we’re very pleased with the progression that we’re making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So, all of these are pretty favorable. We are observing that right now, the -- we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S. But, if you look at the budget that has been put in place and if -- or that has been proposed and if it’s approved, it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology or our T&E line item, which we view as a favorable dynamic. Peripherally, the Infrastructure Bill that is getting through the Congress has some sustained spend outlays for EV and broadband and semiconductor, which we also think is favorable for us.
Mark Delaney: That’s really helpful color. Thank you for all those comments. And my follow-up question was on the supply chain. And if you could talk in a bit more depth around what is leading to your comments of potential alleviation in the second half of this coming fiscal year? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I mean, the supply chain situation is very dynamic, I guess, I would start by saying that. And we are -- we have very close relationships with our key suppliers and are in constant dialogue with them during this period of time to make sure that we are procuring the parts that are necessary to meet the needs of our customers. I think it’s -- our confidence and our guide reflects a -- the start of a recovery in the supply chain situation in the back half, and that stems from direct indications that we’ve got from key suppliers within our supply chain environment.
Operator: We’ll move over to Tim Long from Barclays.
Tim Long: Thank you. Two, if I could. Maybe on the wireless side, could you talk a little bit about kind of the impact of C-band and current views on millimeter wave and particularly with the C-band, any impacts from these potential delays with the FAA, et cetera? And then secondly, maybe, Neil, could you just kind of update us -- it’s obviously been a great period of margin expansion. Can you talk a little bit -- give us an updated view on kind of leverage and incremental margin growth and operating from these levels? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I’ll make a few comments on 5G. As we stated before, the continuing deployments that are going on, especially in the low frequency bands across the world, we view it as a favorable dynamic, specifically the C-band auction was a near-term catalyst. And we’ve had some strong results, as I mentioned, double -- strong double-digit growth in 5G this quarter, capping off a double-digit growth in 5G for the full fiscal year. And a big part of that was driven by the C-band auction and the related investments that are going on in the Americas. Our Americas business was -- grew the strongest in our 5G from a regional perspective, and we also saw our FR1, our low frequency business double year-over-year. So, very strong results, all the while when our millimeter wave business has been pretty stable this year. And as we have mentioned before, in the medium term, we’re expecting that the millimeter wave adoption continues to rise in a very steady manner and we’re watching for the Beijing Olympics use cases to emerge from the success of the Beijing Olympics that we expect to occur next year.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. And Tim, to your second question, yes, we’ve obviously had a great run here in terms of margin expansion since the birth of Keysight, adding 800 basis points approximately to gross margins, about 1,000 basis points to operating margins. And I think the key point is that as we look forward over the longer term, we continue to see opportunities for further expansion of margins within the Keysight portfolio. I think as we look to next year, it’s a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we’ve got inflationary pressures across the broader economy. And then, the other thing that we’re looking forward -- looking to, that’s a little bit of a cost up within next year is hopefully a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating environment, and that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the office, increase travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business in person rather than over Zoom. I think -- and maybe the last point being that we saw -- we invested in R&D this year just under 16% of revenue. I think we continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace. I think you’re likely to see R&D tick upward next year into that kind of mid-16% range. So from those perspectives, I think FY22 may be a bit of a catch-up year. But over the longer term, a lot of opportunity as we expand our software portfolio, expand our solutions portfolio, continue to work with customers and provide them with first-to-market solutions to continue to drive both, gross and operating margins northward.
Jason Kary: And the next question comes from Matt Niknam of Deutsche Bank.
Unidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. This is Nick on for Matthew. Congrats on the quarter. So just first, I wanted to talk about CapEx, the guide is picking up next year. I just want to know what’s driving that uplift and whether that should carry on into future years, like is that sustainable, or is there a specific project that’s going on, and I have a follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: So, we started to -- or we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain. And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think, in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So, I think those are additive, given everything that’s happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so, I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we’ve communicated for next year is the new steady state, that is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, exactly where -- a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we’re indicating for FY22.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay. That makes sense. And then, just a quick follow-up on competitive environment. I mean, there are a few puts and takes that I’m just thinking about and I was wondering you could provide some color. On the one hand, a lot of competitors are having a harder time sending up shipments, does that create a positive pricing environment? And then, a slightly different angle, one of your competitors recently made some easy acquisitions. Just how you think about EISG from the competitive landscape going forward?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Very strong performance in our EISG business. Again, strength, as I mentioned, in the semiconductor, where new wafer starts are really enabling us to continue to drive growth there. A very strong year again, building off of a strong double-digit year last year in semiconductor as well. So, when I think about what we’re doing there, we’re definitely taking share and we are continuing to invest to keep that portfolio growing and capitalizing on the environment we see semiconductor. With regard to automotive, it’s been a newer market entry for us. Relatively speaking, we started this in spin. We’re very pleased with the results we’re seeing so far. And we’ve made -- if you look at this fiscal year, we’ve had some wins in the manufacturing expansions that have happened in the EV sector. And as we shore up our contributions in the AV market, we’ve announced a partnership with NIO, as an example, of what we’re doing by extending our 5G technology stack in C-V2X. In summary, all-in-all, you look at our entire portfolio for automotive, it is growing and it is much more comprehensive than any of our traditional competitors at this point, and we are continuing to invest in growing that business. So overall, pleased with where we find ourselves with the EISG business.
Ron Nersesian: And your second question, which was with competitors having a little tougher time on shipments, are we going ahead and taking advantage of that for pricing? The answer is no. We’re in this for the long haul with customers. We’ve been back from the original Hewlett-Packard days, over 80 years working with customers. We’re not taking advantage of them. Where costs are up in certain areas for shipments and others, we will do price increases, but not because of any competitive position or hard ability for our customers to get products from competitors.
Jason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS.
Chris Snyder: So, the Company in the past has talked to industry growth in the 3% to 5% range with expectations for about 100 to 200 bps of outgrowth for Keysight above the industry. But, when we look at it over the last four years now, the Company has been growing about 10% organically per annum. So, I guess, my question is, is this level of growth more so driven by just much stronger industry growth over the last four years or just better Keysight outgrowth or a combination of both? Can you just kind of help us unpack how we kind of bridge that gap?
Ron Nersesian: I’ll make a couple of comments and then turn it over. I think it’s a combination of two. There’s no doubt that we’ve seen more growth and more opportunity in 5G. But, as we see the digitization of everything, the market is, there is no doubt, a great place to be. And we have a very-diversified portfolio, and we’re seeing growth in semiconductor. We’re seeing growth in Industrial 4.0. We’re seeing growth all across our real stated growth initiatives and the markets that we’ve gone after. So, there is no doubt we pick markets that are winning, and we have been growing faster than the market in general. And I think the execution of the team, the investment that we have and our strategy of providing customers with total solutions is unmatched in the industry. Others are trying to mimic it to a certain extent. But I do believe with our outstanding sales force, sales support organization, our overall organization that provides hardware, software and, we’ll call it, partnership with key market makers, it makes a huge difference on how successful we are. So, I’ll stop there, and Satish may want to make another comment.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Ron, I think you’re absolutely right. With regard to what we see in the marketplace is this expanding ecosystem as we have expanded our portfolio from just products to offering total solutions to customers, we remain focused on the end markets that we’ve called out. Another angle to this that Mark Wallace can add is the customer adds that occurs has this expanding contribution that we’re making.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Satish. Chris, to add to this, I think our go-to market, the investments we’ve made in sales and marketing and customer engagement is making a big difference. As you’ve heard, we had strong double-digit order growth across all regions and all end markets, not just for Q4, but for the entire fiscal year. So, this is a very sustaining effect that we’ve had as we engage with the market leaders implanting our solutions engineers to help innovate with customers, our largest customers have grown substantially, our long tail of small and medium-sized business customers have grown. And, as Ron has mentioned in the prepared statements, we continue to add new customers, every quarter and every year, more than 2,000 were added during fiscal year ‘21, which creates sustaining opportunities for us going forward, diversifies our business. And then, it’s not just all about our direct channel. We have a very strong partnership or partner channel with the indirect channel distribution sales helping us reach more than 30,000 customers per year, and we’re seeing continued growth from our e-commerce channels as well. So, we have multiple ways to serve our customers and deliver these great solutions. And I think that’s a big part of it, too.
Chris Snyder: Yes. I appreciate all of that color from everybody. I guess, my follow-up would be -- so in terms of the above normal industry growth, how long can that last? And is it reasonable to think that lasts until 5G peaks, which I believe is expected maybe in the ‘23 or ‘24 time frame? And then, in addition to that, is there any reason why we should expect Keysight outgrowth over the market to compress back to the 100 or 200 bps kind of guided levels, just given the R&D scale investment advantage the Company has?
Ron Nersesian: If we were sitting at a total of, let’s say, 60% market share or 70% market share, you may say there’s diminishing returns. But when we look overall, where we are -- we’re in the 25% to 30% range, we have a lot of headroom, and I believe it’s going to go way past 5G. 5G, whether you’re talking ‘24 or whatever your perspective is on that, we’re already investing in 6G. We’re investing in EV. We’re investing in AV. And there are so many more opportunities that are being put right in front of us or that we see, we are aiming to go ahead and outgrow the market for many, many years.
Neil Dougherty: The only thing I would add to that is our ability to spend $800 million a year in R&D as a real differentiator in the marketplace, and I think goes to at least to indicate what our ability to continue to outperform the broader market should be over time.
Jason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Rob Mason at Baird.
Rob Mason: Yes. Thanks [Technical Difficulty]
Jason Kary: Sorry, Rob. We…
Ron Nersesian: Rob, your audio has cut out.
Neil Dougherty: I think we just lost the call.
Ron Nersesian: We can come back to you.
Operator: Mr. Mason, your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes. Can you hear me?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, we can hear you, Rob. Go ahead.
Rob Mason: Okay. Apologies, not sure what happened. I did have a clarification question just on the first quarter guidance. So, I guess, Neil, maybe this directed to you. Is the assumption that margins would be down year-over-year within your guidance? I’m not sure I totally caught your below-the-line guidance.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. All I said was relative to where we just finished Q4, right, we finished the year at 15.9% R&D investment. It was a point lower than that in the fourth quarter. And I think we look and see a tremendous amount of opportunity for us to invest via the R&D line to bring new technologies to market. So, I think over the course of FY22, you could expect us to return our R&D spend more into that mid-16% kind of a range, which will obviously have a little bit of a pressure on margins. The only other thing I would say is in Q4, we did have extraordinary -- we did a very favorable product mix within the quarter, at least, as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable, so. And then, there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do company-wide salary administration in the first quarter. And given the inflationary environment that we’re in, that is a larger than typical salary increase, this Q1.
Rob Mason: I see. How would...
Ron Nersesian: And again that’s compared to Q4, which was a 31% operating margin. That was very, very high record.
Rob Mason: Right. How would your expectation within 10% type EPS growth, how would your assumptions around incentive compensation play out on a year-over-year basis?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So obviously, there’s two components to our incentive programs. There’s the incentive programs for the broader employee base, which are driven based on the organic growth rate of the Company as well as our operating margins. And so, those would be the true drivers there. I think, for the executive population’s ability to grow EPS, and this is for the cash compensation portion, its ability to grow EPS and grow the top line. And over the longer term, we -- our primary source of variable compensation is based on total shareholder return. And so, I think as we look forward to FY22, we’re seeing wages up significantly as a result of kind of the broader inflationary environment, and that’s being offset by a decrease in the broader variable pay programs.
Rob Mason: Okay. Just a quick follow-up. With respect to your capital allocation plan, could you just give us an update on how you view the M&A pipeline, where -- maybe where your focus would be at this point?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Absolutely, Ron?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Again, in our target markets, what we’re looking to do is provide total solutions. But, as we -- and there’s no doubt if there are certain parts or components of a total solution that we need, that would be the first priority. The second thing that we’re doing is we’re expanding into adjacent markets. As Satish had mentioned earlier, we started off in 5G or 4G, mostly on the physical layer going ahead and providing solutions there, then we moved up into the protocol layer and now you can see we’re in the application layer and security. So, we continue to look for adjacent opportunities also. That is what we’re looking at. We have a very robust funnel, but we also have very high hurdles. So, we have the ability to not only make the acquisitions that we need to make, but also to return cash to the shareholders, and that’s why we announced $1.2 billion share buyback program.
Jason Kary: Next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Just a quick one on margins. I’m curious how you guys are thinking about operating margin improvement by segment. You had such tough -- you had a great year at EISG. I just wonder if that creates a tough comp for you, or if you can even build off of the ‘21 result?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Certainly, obviously, a very tough comp for EISG, given the strong results, not just within the quarter where they reached up into the upper 30s, but 36%, for the full year here. I think we have opportunities to increase margins across both segments. I think we have initiatives in place across both segments to increase software content, to increase solutions content and to increase the value added that we’re bringing to customers. And so, I think if you think about opportunities in EV and IoT for EISG and, of course, in not just 5G, but 6G and quantum and aerospace, defense on the CSG side, there’s ample market opportunity for us to continue to increase the value add that Keysight brings to our customers. And I think as we do that that has a chance to be margin accretive across both groups.
Jason Kary: Great. Thanks, Adam. So, well, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to thank you all for joining us. And we look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences. So, thanks again, and have a great day.
Operator: That concludes today’s call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2021 Q3  (2021-08-18 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Second Quarter 2021 earnings conference call. My name is Holly, and I'll be your lead operator today. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] I would now like to hand the conference over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer, and Investor Relations.
Jason Kary: Thank you and welcome everyone to the Keysight Third Quarter earnings conference call for the fiscal year 2021. Joining me are Ron Nersesian, Keysight 's Chairman, President and CEO, and Neil Dougherty, our CFO. Joining us in the Q&A session will be Satish Dhanasekaran, Chief Operating Officer, and Mark Wallace, Senior Vice President of Global Sales. The press release and information to supplement today's discussion, are on our website at investor.keysight.com. Click on the link for quarterly reports under the financial information tab where you will find an investor presentation along with Keysight 's segment results.  Following this call, we will also post a copy of the prepared remarks. Today's comments will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We will also make references to core growth, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted.

Lastly, I would highlight that management is scheduled to participate in upcoming virtual investor conferences hosted by Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, and Citi. And now, I will turn the call over to Ron.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another Quarter of excellent results. Solid industry dynamics are accelerating demand for our differentiated solutions and we continue to capitalize on broad-based technology investment across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered record Q3 orders, all-time record revenue, and our highest quarterly operating margin of the year. The durability of our business model was on full display as we continued to effectively navigate supply chain challenges.  Second, Keysight's first-to-market software-centric solution strategy continues to yield consistently strong results. Since our launch in 2015, through our expected 2021 finish, we will have delivered 9% compound annual revenue growth and 16% annualized earnings growth, both well above our long-term commitments. Despite significant headwinds of trade restrictions and a global pandemic. Our investments are well aligned with the highest impact market opportunities as we continue to enable our customer success and deliver value to our shareholders.  Third, given our outstanding performance year-to-date, we expect to achieve 2021 year-over-year revenue growth of 16% and EPS of $6.03, which represents 24% earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We have strong momentum entering 2022, and our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets remain intact. And we expect to drive incremental margin expansion going forward. Now let's take a deeper look at our Third Quarter performance. Record Q3 orders of 1.3 billion grew 23%. All-time record revenue also grew 23% to 1.2 billion. We delivered a gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 27%, and earnings of $1.54, which was well above the high-end of our guidance and represents 29% year-over-year earnings growth.  Keysight continues to deliver outstanding growth despite year-over-year headwinds due to trade restrictions in ongoing supply chain disruption. Our growth rates are not only just a result of soft year-over-year comparisons but also reflect sustained multi-year above-market growth. For example, Q3 orders are up 18%, and revenue was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2019, prior to the global pandemic. The strength and durability of our business model are delivering as expected. We see accelerated demand from our differentiated solutions, from both existing and new customers.  Our customer engagement throughout the pandemic has been strong with approximately 1,900 new customers added in 2020, which we will expect to exceed in 2021. Looking at our business segments for the third quarter in a row, we've reported double-digit year-over-year order and revenue growth across both segments and all regions. Demonstrating the breadth and differentiated portfolio across a diverse set of end markets. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved strong double-digit order and revenue growth across all regions, as well as its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue.  Continued investment in chipsets for 5G data center cloud and AI applications drove demand for our differentiated semiconductor solutions, resulting in another Quarter of record orders and revenue. Investment also remains high in advanced technology nodes in capacity expansion for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demand. Our general electronics business achieved record Q3 orders and revenue. 4 consecutive Quarters s of double-digit order and revenue growth demonstrate Keysight's breadth of contributions across multiple industries.  Strength in the Quarter was driven by investments in customers' broad-based digital transformation, industrial IOT, digital health, Industry 4.0, and advanced academic research. in automotive, record Q3 orders and all-time record revenue were driven by the ongoing macroeconomic recovery, acceleration in EV and AV technology investment, and manufacturing expansion to meet pent-up demand. As the trend towards autonomous vehicles gains momentum, Keysight remains focused on enabling next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D workflow.  We recently announced a new cellular vehicle or C-V2X autonomous drive emulation solution, which provides a real-world environment emulator for in-lab testing to simulate realistic roadway scenarios. We continue to see steady demand for EV and AV solutions, including automotive ethernet compliance and cybersecurity test. Our communications solutions group achieved record third-quarter orders in revenue and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth despite trade restrictions that impacted one of our larger customers in China.  Aerospace, defense, and government delivered record Q3 orders and revenue. Revenue grew double-digits across all major regions. While benefiting from a soft prior-year comparison, growth was again driven by space satellite, electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G, and early 6G research applications. U.S. government and prime contractor investment were strong, while internationally, Europe rebounded from a year ago, coupled with solid growth in Asia. Our application solution strategy drove a significant win with a leading research institute in this quarter.  Keysight 's leading-edge integrated wireless and wireline testbed is enabling their next-generation terabit and 6G research. Our aerospace, defense, and government customers will also benefit from our differentiated services offering to enable their mission-critical program needs. In Q3, we entered into multiple U.S. prime contractor engagements for calibration and uptime surfaces. Commercial Communications achieved third-quarter record orders in revenue adjusted for the impact of China trade restrictions, Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double-digits.  Ongoing strength was driven by global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G chipsets and devices, ORAN adoption, 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet for data centers, and increased spending by service providers. Our collaboration with key 5G innovators remains strong as we continue to lead with new industry firsts. In partnership with Qualcomm, we were the first to achieve 10 gigabits per second 5G data connections. Keysight was also selected by Vodafone, along with other industry leaders such as Samsung, NEC, and Dell to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions for the deployment of Europe's first commercial O-RAN network.  [Indiscernible], acquired earlier this year, had a strong quarter driven by expanding adoption of our WaveJudge wireless test system, which further enhances Keysight's 5G solutions for deployments. Keysight continues to enable next-generation wireline standards, such as 800 Gigabit ethernet. Our newly announced 800 Gigabit ethernet solutions saw strong demand within the Quarter. In a recent partnership with Cisco and Amphenol, we demonstrated high data rate, multi-vendor interoperability, a key enabler of next-generation networks. The combination of our network apps and our leading physical layer Bit Error Rate testers and oscilloscopes is driving new levels of customer insight and value.  Higher-value services are driving differentiation while strengthening our competitive position. [Indiscernible] with AIR [Indiscernible] exceeding $1 billion. Our growing mix of software and services is increasing the durability of our business model while reducing overall cyclicality. They are both contributing to Keysight 's margin expansion with an Operating margin at or above the Company average. Keysight 's focus on operational excellence continues to drive our consistent execution and our employees are critical to our success.  Employee growth is a key component of the Keysight leadership model and we view our high-performance culture as a competitive advantage. As such, we are honored to have our team in Malaysia recognized as the overall winner of the employee experience awards by human resources online. This award is in recognition of the innovative [Indiscernible] team to proactively engage employees and create positive experiences, despite unprecedented pandemic-related challenges.  Our employees in Malaysia have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances since COVID restrictions were imposed and our production operations were impacted. To mitigate the risk of COVID - 19 to employees, customers, and suppliers. Keysight implemented a vaccine program for both Keysight employees and our suppliers. Over 95% of our employees at the Malaysian facility are now vaccinated. In addition, vaccination rates at a large U.S. site are above their local community averages.  In summary, our momentum continues, and our strategy is generating strong results. We have a track record of consistent execution and delivering on our commitments. I am confident in our ability to capitalize on many growth opportunities ahead of us as we finish the fiscal year, and look forward to 2022. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil, to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter as broad-based technology investment accelerated demand for our differentiated solutions. Resulting in better-than-expected results in the quarter. Third-quarter revenue of one billion was above the high-end of our guidance and grew 23% or 21% on a core basis. We achieved third-quarter orders of $1,310,000 up 23% or 20% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of China trade restrictions, orders grew 29%. Turning to our operational results, we reported a Q3 gross margin of 65%, which increased 60 basis points year-over-year.  Operating expenses of $472 million were well-managed despite higher variable compensation. The operating margin was 27%, up over 100 basis points. We achieved a net income of $286 million and delivered $1.54 in earnings per share, which was above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the Quarter was 186 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, achieved Third Quarter revenue of $875 million up 15%. CSG delivered a gross margin of 66%, which increased 50 basis points year-over-year.  The operating margin was 26%. Commercial Communications revenue of $595 million increased 6%, driven by continued investments across the 5G lifecycle, and our leadership in emerging applications. As Ron mentioned, adjusting for the transient impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, Commercial Communications revenue grew double-digits. Aerospace, Defense, and Government revenue of $280 million grew 39% and recorded double-digit growth across all major regions led by U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group or EISG generated another record revenue quarter of $371 million up 48% or 44% on a core basis.  Order and revenue strength were notable across all markets and regions as semiconductor, general electronics, and automotive solutions, orders and revenue all grew strong, double-digits. EISG reported a gross margin of 64% and a record operating margin of 31%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $257 million, and free cash flow of $217 million or 17% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and remain focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions, and share repurchase.  Under our share repurchase authorization during the Quarter, we acquired approximately 570,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $140. For a total consideration of $80 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect the Fourth Quarter of 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,250,000,000 to 1,270 billion, which represents 3% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full-year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $4.9 billion, representing 16% revenue growth.  We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 -$1.65 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 186 million shares. Full-year earnings at the midpoint of our guidance are $6.03, representing 24% EPS growth. In closing, our expected 2021 revenue and earnings per share represent 7%, and 13% compounded annual growth over the last two years, since 2019. Both are not only above our long-term expectations but accomplished in the face of significant COVID-related disruption last year and the substantial negative effect of China trade restrictions.  Our consistent execution demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Beyond 2021, our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets, as well as our financial model remain intact as we see continued opportunity for incremental margin expansion. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Holly, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator Instructions]. We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. Okay, we'll go to the next caller. Our next question will come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Two follow-up questions, regarding the communications group. Could it be possible that some of the high-end equipment you sell that is used for high-frequency and traditionally categorized under communication -- under commercial communications is now categorized in mid-layer or vice versa, like it's early in the adoption, maybe more millimeter way of application is currently categorize in middle arrow.  And then when it's commercialized, it would be reclassified under Commercial Communications? And I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, this is Satish, I'll take this. Clearly, the focus for us is to maintain a lot of leverage across our portfolio between CSG, both commercial and aerospace, and defense. And in our Industrial business across the portfolio, we sell a common set of tools to all engineers. And you're right in pointing out that the millimeter-wave opportunity is pretty broad.  Now, it will take quite a bit of time to play out in the end markets driven by spectrum and different interests across the globe. But it is broad, such as millimeter-wave is clearly being used in space and satellite communications. It's being used in aerospace -- in automotive for sure.  And now with the commercialization of this technology finds its application in 5G. And we actually classify orders based on customers who buy them. And we're able to maintain a lot of operating leverage across our businesses that way.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you. And then one follow-up for Neil. When are we going to get an update on the longer-term target operating margin? I know you have been focusing on increasing the ratable mix of business and software mix, but you're -- you have been operating above the long-term target, and I just -- we're in a phase where it's like how long can you operate above it? Any metric, any update will be great here. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Just make one final comment to tack on to Satish 's answer. As a result of our classification of sales by customer, we actually have 5G orders and revenue not only within aerospace, defense, and commercial comps but also with EISG as well because of the way that, that is done. Under a question about, long-term operating model. First, we're very pleased with the results.  If you look at our 3 quarters to date here in 2020 -- FY21 plus our guide for Q4, we expect to finish this year with an Operating margin basically at the long-term target that we outlined at our March 2019 Analyst Day where we said 20 -- 26 to 27%. We are going to be at that 27% level here in FY '21. So, we're pleased that we've achieved that objective two years ahead of where we expected to achieve it.  So, we've been making progress faster than expected. And then, as we said in our prepared comments today, we don't believe that we're done. We believe that we have continued room for margin expansion. And while I don't have an updated guide for you today or an updated long-term model. I will tell you that we do have multiple levers that we're working across the business.  You noted a couple of them, continuing to grow our software and services businesses at a rate that's faster than the overall Company average and therefore growing our ARR at rates that are faster abroad instead of initiatives focused on gross margin improvement wherever you've seen our gross margin improvement over the last several years go from the upper 50s into the mid-60 percent range and then continuing to leverage our G&A infrastructure.  And so, we believe we continue to have a lot of levers and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement going forward.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you, guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. Can you hear me?
Ron Nersesian: Yes.
Jim Suva: Great. Thank you. When I think about the longer-term, specifically your end markets, and I look at them, I take a look at automotive, where it looks like you've been underpenetrated or at least a smaller portion of your sales.  As you look ahead, is that something that you think could materially be pretty big for the Company in the years ahead, or is there something unique about it? I mean, I look at every car that's being sold out there or the newer ones coming out, they just have a lot more electronics and things that need to be calibrated and tested, or is there something unique about that industry that would prevent you from going into it?  Or maybe it's already big for you now, how much is it? Is the profitability the same, it seems like the design times should actually be more favorable because you design a car for multiple years compared to consumer electronics. If you can give us some insights on the automotive strategic view that you may have?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. This is Ron. Hi, Jim. If you take a look at our overall automotive business. It is really transforming in a very large way. As you know, the automobile is really turning into a computer with big batteries and a lot of wireless sensors that communicate to many, many different devices. And that really plays right into our strength. In the old world, the electromechanical car with the combustion engine was relatively low-tech with regards to electronics. Sure, there are transducers and things that are put on suspension systems.  To look at shocks and engine performance. But more and more microprocessors are in cars and the whole car itself is really built around electronics that we test. Whether it's computers or the wireless sensors for either radar or for 5G, et cetera. So, we see this as a very big long-term trend for us. As far as production, it depends. Things that are more complex, we're going to have a role in.  Things that get reduced to a simple test; we won't be playing in that area as it's a very price competitive market that doesn't really need as much value from us. But in R&D, where we focus, that is the sweet spot for us. So, R&D-focused AV, EV technology is really, really a great opportunity for us going forward.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and congratulations to you and all your teams.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. The team did a great job.
Operator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank.
Matt Niknam: Hey guys, thank you for taking the questions. I have on eon supply chain and one follow-up. Just on the supply chain, you've obviously managed to navigate through some of the challenges of peers you're seeing. Can you comment on whether you saw any incremental Headwinds or even Tailwinds or improvement relative to Last Quarter, and then thoughts on any impact you've embedded into the next quarter's guide?  And then my follow-up, you talked about adding 1900 new customers last year and expecting to exceed that this year. Just any color you can provide in terms of skew or mix, in terms of where these new customers are coming from? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Sure. This is Ron. I'll start off on the supply chain answer, and then turn it over to Neil as we go forward. And then Mark Wallace, our head of sales, will talk about the excellent progress of our new customers.  First, with regard to the supply chain, we've commented on this before. The more complex semiconductors that are in our products, we make right in-house. So, we have a boutique fab that has to produce products that literally have, in many cases, 10 times the performance of commercial products because we're the measurement device, and we have to be more accurate to be able to measure the performance on the commercial devices.  That gives us more control of our supply chain, although we do obviously buy parts and some common -- some common components from other suppliers. But I think we have an exceptional management team and order fulfillment. We have the largest order fulfillment organization in the test and measurement industry.  And I think they've done an excellent job working with our suppliers. There is no doubt that we continue to beat our expectations Quarter after Quarter, after Quarter. But obviously, if there were more components, we'd be able to take our revenue up a little bit more quickly. Now we'll turn it over to Neil, who will add some more commentary.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Just the -- we're not immune to the supply chain situation that's I guess where I would start, but as Ron said, the vertical integration of our supply chain and the fact that we control the production of our most highly specialized parts really helps to mute the impact.  And so, while the impact is not 0 within the quarter, and it's not 0 within Q4 where -- where we just guided the impact is relatively small. And so, I don't think it's a terribly huge concern, I think we're doing a good job managing the expectations of our customers and getting the product into the hands of customers on a timeline that they find to be acceptable.  I can't point to any examples at this point where we have had orders canceled because of the inability of us to manage our supply chain risks and get the product into the hands of our customers. So, I'll leave it at that.
Ron Nersesian: And with regard to new customers, before I turn it over to Mark, that's an effort of doing many different things. First, we have added many folks to our feet on the street program that Mark will talk about, or direct field engineers or salespeople that could expand our presence. We've worked in indirect channels and expanding our efforts there, as well as increasing our marketing efforts to make sure that people understand our value. And all of those things feed on top of each other.
Mark Wallace: That's right. Thanks, Ron. And Matt, I'll just build on that. As you've heard our results were very broad-based across all segments in all regions. And we put a lot of attention as you hear from these calls on innovating with the industry leaders. Our largest customers are top 20 were up very strong, high double-digit. But we added 600 more than 600 new customers during Q3. And as Ron mentioned in his prepared statements, we're on track to exceeding 1900, which we added last year. And this is by design.  We have a focus on reaching new customers through a combination of marketing, our direct channel, which, at the end of this year, will be more than twice as big as it was just a few years ago, and through our indirect channel, which is a combination of distributors and our e-commerce platform, where the majority of customers who access Keysight electronically online, are new customers.  So, I think you could think of it's broad-based across all the segments that we are focused on delivering solutions to today. And it gives us this broader footprint and this higher diversity of customer base that adds to our strength in addition to the top-line growth that delivers quarter after quarter.
Matt Niknam: That's great. Thank you, guys, all for the caller.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. My question is on the guide, which puts I think FQ4 revenues at the midpoint of 4% below FQ3 orders. I mean, looking back the last few years, FQ4 revenues had outpaced the Q3 orders. So, does the guidance reflects expectations that supply chain headwinds will persist? Or are we seeing longer customer lead times or just a longer duration backlog as the Company continues to push into software and return revenues?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I think it's a mix of several of those factors. I certainly don't feel like at this point that we can say the supply chain concerns are behind us. We're continuing to very actively manage the supply chain, and we do expect there'll continue to be some limitations on our ability to ship as a result of those supply chain constraints going forward.  I think you highlighted some of the efforts that are going on in our services and software business that is resulting in increases in our deferred revenue accounts and the ratable recognition of some revenues. And then I think in some markets, most notably the semi market, we have seen -- we have seen customers look to place orders earlier in the system for delivery later out, just as they're looking to secure supply and communicate their own needs.  But we take comfort from the fact that we see the amount of fab construction that is underway and we believe that those orders, particularly given the relationship that Keysight has with that relatively limited customer set are very strong.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate all that. And then I just want to follow up on the previous comments around new customers. 1900 new customers are a lot for a Company who has the market share and the history that Keysight has.  Is the strong rate of customer additions driven by the fact that the total addressable market here is expanding? As we're seeing that the 5G ecosystem brings new verticals into it or is the Company taking wallet share from just existing customers that maybe haven't known, or existing people in the supply chain that have not done business with Keysight previously?
Mark Wallace: Yes. Chris, this is Mark. I will add some more color to that. You have to first start with the baseline that we do business with more than 30,000 customers each and every year. So, we have -- in more than 100 countries. So, our presence is broad and wide. You did hit on one of the key elements, which is the expansion of various ecosystems. O-RAN is a great example that is accelerating bringing new customers into the 5G ecosystem.  And then the success we're achieving in really all the ecosystems is expanding our footprint through that leverage. The other part again that Ron mentioned is the combination of marketing and increased selling capacity is enabling us to reach more customers into some of the more broad-based segments.  As an example, in the last several quarters, we saw more education customers turn on, we saw more research. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, it's still early days on the ramp of automotive.  And with that transformation, from prior ICE vehicles to electric and autonomous vehicles, we're seeing a large number of new companies and customers that we're serving in all 4 regions. It's -- as I said before, this is a part of our strategy. We've been running this for 5 years and it's helping us to build this base of customers and accounts going forward.
Ron Nersesian: And the only --
Chris Snyder: Appreciate all of that.
Ron Nersesian: And the only thing I would add to that is if you look at wallet share, you're exactly right. We've expanded into services to get more of our customer's wallet share. We've expanded with our software offerings, and we have added more solutions up and down the communications ecosystem, which clearly gives us a higher percentage of our customer share.  But it's also important to take a look at our competitors and just go back over the last 1, 2, 3, 4 years and take a look at our growth rates versus others. And I think you'll also see market share gains for Keysight.
Chris Snyder: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: You're welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.
Joe Cardoso: Hi, this is Joe Cardoso, I'm for respondent [Indiscernible] Samik Chatterjee. Just one question for me and circling back to automotive. Within the auto, there has been this general excitement around EVs and AV's both with not auto-aligned and not auto-aligned companies looking to leverage those upcoming opportunities.  Can you touch on the competitive landscape there? Particularly in that area of auto and whether you're finding it incrementally tougher relative to the traditional automotive world, given the potential of new competition and how is driving differentiation there? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Thanks, Samik. I think if you -- on one dimension, you look at the biggest changes going on in auto around EV and av as Ron mentioned, in the EV space, it's all about bringing the best precision metrology that we have to measure current and voltage and other basic parameters that enable decision making on extending ranges and this is a matter of us making -- configuring our IP to apply to a different application set. And it's one where there are a lot of Pavlov trends of innovation going on. And we're able to do that today.  And its still very early days in the EV segment, but we're getting embedded with a lot of lead innovators and the larger eco-system that's forming. With regard to AV, clearly, 5G is going to be a big factor that's going to impact the autonomous cars just from the connectivity aspect and the entire technology stack that goes with it. And that's were extending our strength and differentiation in 5G into this marketplace continues to give us a unique position of differentiation.  Some of the successes we're having are on account of that. And as you saw, we just entered into a partnership with Dechra as well to continue to promote this new standard approach to test in this marketplace. Still very early days, we're very pleased with the results this Quarter. We had strong growth and second consecutive Quarter of double-digit growth in auto and there's plenty of runways ahead.
Joe Cardoso: And then competitive landscaping tougher?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. But there's not to the competitive landscape. Clearly, anytime there are traditional competitors that have been in the combustible marketplace, that are trying to configure to try to address this opportunity. But as we think about it, the expertise needed and that -- and the IP needed to play in this space long term. I think we bring a very unique perspective there.
Joe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color., Thanks, guys.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: Good evening. So Keysight came into Fiscal year '21, with a backlog built up due to COVID-19 disruptions in the prior year, and year-to-date, you've already built up what I would kind of call an above-average backlog. So how do you see this interplay of delivery timing, of the supply chain? Do you think that you are able to deliver on that excess backlog over the next 12 months? Is it something that extends? How should we think about that?
Mark Wallace: Yes. It's a great question. So again, I'd start by reiterating the points that I made, which I think we've done a really good job of meeting the needs of our customers and getting them the products that they need in timing, which is satisfactory, at least. I think as you know, we've built up a significant backlog.  I think that backlog is going to -- it's going to come down over temporal, to growing into a right to businesses significantly larger now than it has been previously. So, we would expect to be carrying higher amounts of backlog.  But I don't expect that there's going to be a one or two-quarter flush of material backlog. I think we're going to work it down over time and continue to meet the needs of our customers working with them on scheduling deliveries as we manage the supply chain constraints and the addition of capacity, which we're still investing in to ultimately bring backlog levels in line with the size of our business.
Ron Nersesian: That does provide a lot of confidence for us to be able to continue to grow our revenue base having such a strong backlog situation that we have.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then I think this is the first quarter than you've cited O-RAN as a driver for orders. I know there's been -- you've been making investments. There's been a lot of industry interest here. But are you starting to see via tangible orders as a result?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. O-RAN was the strategic pact we made a year or so ago, we were participating with the original O-RAN Alliance for a longer time than that. At the highest level, we've long seen that the technology stacks are going to get virtualized to take advantage of the economics and the flexibility that comes with the cloud.  And so, we -- you remember, a couple of years ago, we made the acquisition of Prisma, which gave us some unique capabilities, which were then able to combine with our Ixia acquisition that we made subsequently and we've launched the Keysight open ran architect capability Last quarter.  And we've received a sizable order already, and we have a very strong pipeline and this Quarter, we -- we took the Keysight, open ran architect and have now made it available on the Amazon cloud as an offering
Satish Dhanasekaran: As in for customers that are coming into this opportunity from a software perspective. So; it's software testing software. We feel very good about our position in the marketplace. Just want to highlight that multiple open ran test and integration centers around the globe have already selected us in our core offering.  And you've also heard -- I think Ron referenced the success had with Vodafone, one of the phones selecting Keysight as a partner for design and test. So very pleased with it. But again, from a timeline of O-RAN, this is a long-term trend, one that we're well-positioned today, but we'll continue to grow this business over time.
David Ridley-Lane: Alright. Thank you very much and congratulations on the great results in a very tough market. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys, and congratulations.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask one question on semiconductors, can you give us a sense of where we are in the semiconductor cycle for Keysight? And also, how much visibility do you have there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: I'll take this. Clearly, very strong quarter. Again, building on 4 consecutive quarters of record, orders, and revenue in the business. We're very pleased with the performance there. With regard to where we play, we're playing in the wafer test, which is on the front end of the semi-process.  And given the dynamics that are going on around lithography and the advancements that are playing out, especially driven by 5G and datacenter applications for 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer, and 3-nanometers. I think all of those new node-size-based opportunities are still in the very early innings, because one, those nodes have to get stable and then ramp up. So, it's still very early stages there.  So, we view the capital spend for those new node sizes to be, to be fairly stable over time. Obviously, there is a part of the business that is about scaling capacity into mature processes. And we think that will continue given this current semi shortage that is going on and demand being high through '22. And it remains to be seen what happens longer-term.  We also -- it's important to highlight that given the infrastructure spend that's likely to come into the U.S and Europe and other regions, looking to localize supply chain, it's one dynamic that's not factored into any of these outlook projections, but could have more upside for the semi business. But again, you look at the end-market dramatic drivers, whether it's a new memory, topology, or 5G, or data center demand, all of those are feeding into this at this point.
Adam Thalhimer: Good outlook. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Mason with Baird.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good afternoon. Several questions already around supply chain, but I -- perhaps I missed it. But did you speak to your own efforts internally to kind of boost capacity? I know production capacity trying to increase that, at the same time, you're battling some of the COVID-related restrictions was an effort, maybe just an update on that front.  And maybe relatedly as well, is just how do you think about the seasonality of the business we went through this year with the kind of muted seasonality for several reasons, that seasonality continuing as we head into -- or kind of muted seasonality continuing as we head into '22?
Ron Nersesian: Yeah. A great question. So obviously we have been and continue to invest in increasing our own capacity just as a point, we did $4.2 million of revenue last year. We're going to be at $4.9 billion of revenue this year. So, we've added significantly to revenue. Last quarter, we did talk about how within our own factories in subcontractors, we did have some capacity constraints. Those where items were not gating items for us this quarter.  We've added enough capacity that it was no longer the gating item. That doesn't mean that we're done investing as we continue to look forward to the future growth of our business, we're continuing to make investments in further capacity expansion but right now I feel like we're -- doing a good job of staying ahead of the curve, and certainly particularly given that there is some supply chain constraint potentially is relieving a little bit of the -- a little bit of the pressure there.  On the seasonality question, I've answered this question many times over the years. When I sit back to model our businesses at the beginning of any year, we tend to think of coming off of Q4 as our biggest quarter of the year as we model sequentially down in Q1, up in Q2, down a little bit in Q3, and then a big finish in Q4 with the highest quarter of the year.  That's how I would sit down to model our business. As we talked about all through this year, we expected because of the rebound from COVID, and then more recently with some of the supply chain constraints and the needs capacity, we expected that seasonality to be more muted this year than it has historically been.  And I think that's proven out here over the last several quarters. I think as we look forward, at least over the next couple of quarters, I expect that muted seasonality to remain intact. That doesn't mean there won't be any, I just think that the swings will be less than they typically are, and beyond that, it's hard to call.
Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question. The Companies cited trade restructuring into China as a headwind to the growth rate that you reported. I was hoping you could elaborate a bit more on what you've ended up seeing and some of the puts and takes in the context of maybe there are certain customers are not able to shift too.  But to what extent have you been able to offset some of those trade-related headwinds, either as you focus more of your own resources on other customers, or some of the other customers perhaps took market share?
Ron Nersesian: Mark, do you want to take that or --
Mark Wallace: Yes. Yes, I will be happy to. Hey, Mark. As I mentioned before, we did see some uplift from the COVID recovery in certain segments that were really more affected by the impact last year and the early part of this year. You would consider that to be automotive, manufacturing supply chain, the things we've talked about, right, Education and research.  And then our sales into some of the broad customers, both direct and indirect. So, you know that's a dynamic that we certainly experience. We had some pull-in as we talked about before in semiconductor, but it was small and it really gives us this longer visibility through their forecasts and funnels going out many, many quarters as that are a slower moving process with fabs and so forth.  But again, most of our growth in the quarter still comes from the continuing investments in the areas that we're talking about for next-generation technologies across commercial comms, and aerospace, defense, and eMobility. And we've done a great job of capturing those in all regions, including China, where we get all obviously, that's where the headwinds originate. And this last quarter, we overcame them again, sustaining top-line growth in China, double-digit growth when you exclude the trade impact.  And it's really a testament to our ability to pivot to the broad-based business that's available to us in China. And the ability to capture that throughout the various cycles. So, semiconductor again, automotive, general electronics. So, we've not only pivoted in China, but we've also captured this around the world.
Ron Nersesian: And getting more specifically with regard to the trade headwinds, there's no doubt there have been some more companies that have been added to the restricted list. But the team has done an excellent job with still providing growth despite that and making up for, let's say, large sales that were a headwind going into this year. And most of that is behind us. And we look forward to the future.
Mark Wallace: Yeah. I just want to add a little more on that. Q3 was the last quarter of a strong headwind from one customer in China. So, it's going to be a little better going forward.
Mark Delaney: Just a follow-up question on supply chain, and specifically with Malaysia. Given the vaccination rates that you mentioned within your factory, can you talk about to what extent you can operate at normal or near-normal levels of capacity in Malaysia because of those vaccination rates, or are there still restrictions on how much you can have operating in Malaysia? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. We're in Penang in Malaysia. Some of the bigger outbreaks that they did have in Malaysia first occurred in the southern part of Malaysia, not in Penang where we are. But regardless of that, we had a very massive effort to not only vaccinate our employees but also folks that we work with, our partners, some of our contract manufacturers, our shippers that come in.  Anybody that gets in contact with us and we have over 95% that have received the first dose as of the beginning of this week. This week, they were getting the second dose. So that feels very good. That's not a constraint right now. But as the orders grow, we'll continue to build that.  The constraint is just getting some, lower-level components in certain areas but we feel very good about the production capacity that we have in Malaysia. As well as what we have in the other facilities where we do manufacture as we do some manufacturing in the U.S., we do some in Germany. And all together, it's all built into the guide.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: You're welcome.
Operator: And our next question will come from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard: Hey, good afternoon. Neil, just clarification on the 4Q guide. I mean, if the [Indiscernible] headwinds roll-off in the fourth quarter, a little surprise is that the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter wouldn't be better than low single-digits. If that's the case, which would imply a deceleration on two to three-year stack comps.  It doesn't sound like the in-market to change all that much. You talked about supply chains and trains here and there. But you seem to be managing it fairly well. So, am I missing something here or are you embedding perhaps a little more conservatism around in one particular end market?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah, no, I think as we've gone through this year, we've been building our ability to ship and our ability to drive incremental revenues as we've gone through the year right 1180 Q1,1220 Q2, 1246 Q3. We are guiding to 1260 Q4. So, we're making some stepped-up aggressions. In terms of the year-over-year growth rates, obviously, the Q4 of last year was the big bounce-back quarter after our factories reopened up and revamp, following additional COVID shutdown.  And so, we have an unusually tough comparison from a year ago. And frankly, not just on the revenue line, but we've talked about the extraordinarily favorable mix that we saw in Q4 of last year that grew gross margins and operating margins high.  And so, I thinking -- if you're thinking about it from that perspective, I'd just point really to that tough comp is something that's going to mute growth rates here in the fourth quarter. But we continue to make progress as to adding capacity, continue to making progress in terms of ramping our revenue and we're really well-positioned as we look forward to FY '22.
Brandon Couillard: Okay. And then maybe I missed this, but did you give the software and service revenue growth for the third quarter?
Neil Dougherty: We did not, but both businesses do continue to grow very, very strongly here in the fourth quarter. And we're very pleased with the progress we're making in both areas, double-digits for both lines of business.
Brandon Couillard: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And with that, that will conclude today's question and answer session, and I will turn the call over to Jason Kary for closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Holly. And thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming conferences and wish you all a great day and a great evening.
Operator: Once again, we'd like to thank you for your participation in today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason and thank you everyone for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions continues to drive growth across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I will focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered outstanding Q2 results with all-time record orders, revenue and free cash flow. Second, Keysight is enabling leading-edge disruptive innovation around the world. Our solutions have significant differentiation and contribute significant value to customers, which is fueling our growth for the long term. Third, while we are managing longer lead times and component availability, our leading market position, strong customer relationships and supply chain resiliency gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments. Now, let’s take a deeper look across our second quarter performance across both business segments. Record orders of $1.3 billion grew 22%. Revenue grew 36% to $1.2 billion, which was an all-time high. We delivered second quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 26% and earnings of $1.44, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents 85% year-over-year earnings growth. We also achieved record free cash flow of $369 million. Over the last 12 months, Keysight generated just over $1 billion of free cash flow that we’ve deployed through approximately $500 million in acquisitions and $455 million in share repurchases. We continue to be active and disciplined in our capital deployment. Second quarter strength was broad-based with double-digit order and revenue growth across all markets and regions. Outstanding results by both business segments demonstrate the power of Keysight’s diversified portfolio in 5G and beyond. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its third consecutive quarter of record revenue with strong double-digit order and revenue growth in general electronics, semiconductor and automotive.  The breadth of our contributions across multiple industries is exemplified by our double-digit order and revenue growth in our general electronics business. With ongoing investment in broad digital transformation, including advanced consumer electronics, digital healthcare and industrial IoT, Keysight is enabling innovation and capturing technology inflections for the IoT ecosystem. Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove record orders and revenue. Customer investment in advanced technology nodes remains high, while capacity is expanding for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demands. In automotive, record orders resulted from improved macro conditions and increasing investments in EV and AV technologies. Keysight solutions portfolio for the automotive market continues to expand with new advanced technologies such as AC power emulation, millimeter wave radar, power semiconductor technology, automotive ethernet, C-V2X and cybersecurity software systems. As the reinvention of automotive ecosystems continues, Keysight is enabling the disruptive innovation of new mobility technologies. Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record orders and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth in commercial communications and aerospace defense and government. Aerospace, defense and government revenue grew 46%, driven by strong demand in space, satellite, signal monitoring, 5G and early 6G research applications. Keysight’s engagement with key industry players remains strong. We recently enabled a large prime contractors’ first test bed and have secured multiple 5G solutions wins in the aerospace, defense and government markets. Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits, driven by the ongoing investments in 5G and 400-gig, 800-gig Ethernet solutions for data centers. As 5G progresses and deployments drive sustained investment, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead as the ecosystem scales. Recent engagements include a broadening set of new customers as well as key industry players such as NEC, Fujitsu and MediaTek.  We continue to maximize the 5G lifecycle opportunity and lead the industry with differentiated 5G solutions. In addition, the success of our application layer strategy is reflected in the strong demand for new technologies such as O-RAN and business expansion in new end-to-end verticals. Our ability to provide complete solutions for network protocol test, security and visibility is enabling us to solve many challenges across the industry.  In another area of disruption, we continue to advance our long-term initiative to enable the quantum revolution. We are growing our quantum engagements with key customers worldwide. We also expanded our quantum solutions portfolio this quarter with the acquisition of Quantum Benchmark, which brings deep expertise in the performance validation software for quantum computing. Keysight’s software-centric solutions in higher-value services continue to drive differentiation and recurring revenue growth. For the second quarter in a row, software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Beyond innovation, execution and financial discipline, Keysight’s culture has long embraced corporate social responsibility. We believe our focus on climate and diversity provides us with a competitive advantage. We recently published our annual CSR report, which includes progress towards our prior goals and the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions in the company operations by 2040. We are working to set interim science-based targets to ensure our progress towards this goal. Diversity and inclusion are also embodied in our Keysight leadership model. As a CEO priority, we have specific goals and actions that will be tracked by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. Diversity and inclusion brief will be published this month that describes our longstanding D&I philosophy as well as the details of our strategies and goals. While there is more work to do, Keysight remains steadfast in our commitment to CSR and building a better planet. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our differentiated solutions while managing the longer lead times and component availability constraints. Our in-house high-performance semiconductor fab and the strength of our order fulfillment team are helping us manage these near-term supply challenges and give us confidence in our ability to navigate them entering the second half of this year. In summary, Keysight is enabling disruptive innovation across multiple waves of technology with a decades-long runway ahead of us. Our execution in the face of many dynamic challenges this past year is a testament to the Keysight leadership model, our employees and the breadth and depth of our customers. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered another outstanding quarter and better-than-expected results as robust demand for our differentiated solutions and continued macro recovery resulted in strong growth across all regions. Second quarter revenue of $1.22 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 36% or 33% on a core basis versus a soft compare due to COVID-related disruption. Q2 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across all markets and geographies as the Keysight team navigated macro dynamics and supply chain constraints. We achieved second quarter orders of $1.332 billion, up 22% or 19% on a core basis. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 64%, which increased 170 basis points. Operating expenses of $467 million were well managed, resulting in operating margin of 26%. As discussed last quarter, variable pay expense increased approximately $30 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue growth and operating margin. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.44 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 187 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group achieved second quarter revenue of $877 million, up 34% while delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 25%. Commercial Communications orders and revenue in the second quarter were all-time highs. Revenue of $606 million increased 30%, driven by continued investment across the 5G lifecycle. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $271 million grew 46%, resulting from strong demand across all regions, primarily in the U.S. and Asia-Pacific, followed by a strong recovery in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $344 million, up 42% or 37% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all regions, particularly in Asia-Pacific. Semiconductor, general electronics measurement and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digit. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 28%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our second quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $402 million and free cash flow of $369 million or 30% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and are focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchases. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired 1.59 million shares on the open market at an average price of $138.36 for a total consideration of $220 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance, we expect third quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.225 billion, which represents 20% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 187 million shares. In closing, we are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. We are pleased with our operational execution and remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver on our commitments. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Gabriel, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Mehdi Hosseini, Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Neil, both segments, CSG and EISG, had sequential increase in revenue, but operating margin declined. Can you elaborate is that due to the ongoing COVID costs and what else is impacting? And then where are we in the evolution of millimeter wave? And when is Keysight’s expectation for millimeter wave to go from like R&D into full production? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, Mehdi. Hey, thanks for the question. So yes, you are correct. And as I had indicated last quarter, we were expecting a very sizable sequential increase in our variable pay expense in Q2 relative to Q1. Given that one of the primary drivers of that payout is organic revenue growth and we had the soft revenue comp a year ago because of the COVID disruption. So, we saw about a $30 million sequential increase in variable pay as a result of that. And then I will hand it over to Satish and he can address your millimeter wave question.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Hi, Mehdi. As we have said before, millimeter wave is a long-term opportunity for Keysight. We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So, we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we are on the front-end of something that’s going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term roadmap that’s playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So, it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are. It’s still very early days.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Joe Cardoso: Hi. Yes, this is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to follow-up on the last question, particularly around the supply chain issues that have been impacting companies industry-wide. I guess just a clarification on my part. In this quarter, did you see an impact from supply issues on your top line and margins? And if so, what was the impact – can you quantify the impact? And then relative to the guidance, are you guys baking in any headwind, material headwinds on the top line or margins? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Hi, this is Ron. As you know, in the last quarter, we exceeded our revenue guidance. And you have seen our guide for the next quarter, very pleased with the performance and how we have been able to deliver the revenue despite what’s going on in the world. Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity as well as some supply chain components shortages. However, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry we have an onsite fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We are very confident in the guide that we have. But there is no doubt that we have built backlog and our order book is strong. So, as the world situation unravels, we could increase revenue even more and more in the future.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Ron, I am just kind of curious, with the recent C-band auctions in the U.S. now behind us, can you help me better understand how that kind of impacts your view on your comms business as we go throughout the balance of this year? And as you do that, I’d be kind of curious as to the sort of geographic distribution specifically. As you think about next quarter and beyond, how much more important is China or are you actually starting to see things percolate in the U.S. and beyond?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, John, it’s a good question. With regard to the deployment scenarios globally, as we all know, China started to lead the 5G deployments. And with the C-band auction coming in, the major announcements from the U.S. operator referencing a roadmap to deploy more 5G in the country, we view it as a positive. We saw an uptick of our – in our business in the U.S., specifically for capabilities in the C-band this quarter, and we view the funnel and pipeline to be strong there. But again, not to get too siloed on one spectrum, because at the end of the day, our customers are looking to test for creating devices and products that cater to the global marketplace. And right now, we have 9,000 different band combinations that our customers have to test for eventually. And today, they are testing 2,000. So – and we are enabling all our customers who are staying in the lead and we feel good about our position there.
John Pitzer: And then just quickly, Neil, on the variable comp, was this quarter a particularly sort of step-up quarter and how do we think about kind of the growth in variable comp from here as you guys continue to execute?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So, I mean this quarter wasn’t unusual. Obviously, we delivered 36% revenue growth. That’s the total. There was – some of that was, it was inorganic. But with those high levels of revenue growth, it drives our variable compensation towards the high-end of the – of what is possible. I think as you look forward next quarter, we still have a reasonably soft comp. We are guiding into the kind of low 20% range, which is still quite aggressive growth and it’s going to see variable comp high again in Q3, not quite as high as Q2, but still quite elevated. And then we start to get to more normalized comps during the quarter and a little bit more of a return to normalized levels.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Helpful guys and congratulations.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks very much, John. And please note that the comp that we are talking about, the variable comp is for all employees in Keysight and that is paid. One big factor is revenue growth, and you saw our revenue growth number, which is driving that near the extreme limit.
Operator: Your next question will come from John Marchetti with Stifel. Please go ahead.
John Marchetti: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the Malaysian operations that you guys have. Obviously, with some of the surges that we are starting to see, particularly in Southeast Asia, if there is concerns there on your side that you may have to slow some things down there from your own manufacturing standpoint?
Ron Nersesian: No, our manufacturing is very well distributed. We have the largest test and measurement factory in the world in Penang, Malaysia, but we also have facilities that do development, early production runs as well as produce certain products in Europe as well as in the U.S., but the bulk of it is overseas. We don’t manufacture anything of scale in China. So, that’s not an issue to us. And Penang seems to be in a very good position to capitalize on any type of regional shift.
John Marchetti: Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up regionally, when we think of the China business overall, you mentioned some of the uptick on the semi side as you are seeing some of the increased capacity, not just there, but elsewhere coming in. But any change that you have seen relative to some of the language or what’s going on in China, just given the bit of exposure that you have across the portfolio there?
Ron Nersesian: No. We actually saw strong order results and order growth as well as revenue growth. Mark will tell you a little bit more about it. We did have about 3 points of headwinds from Huawei, where this is really the second to last quarter that we expect to have that. But despite that, we had very strong order and revenue growth. And I will let Mark, our Head of Sales give you a little more color.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thank you, Ron. John, it is another quarter where we have mitigated the impact from the headwinds, as Ron said, about 3 points during the second quarter. And we pivot to other opportunities and other customers. It really exemplifies the breadth and strength of our business as well as the investments we’ve made in our direct sales organization there. And we’re seeing strong opportunities and growth across China in semiconductor, 5G commercial space. Automotive is really starting to pick up, and then general electronics as well. So, I’m very pleased with what we’ve seen. We’ve got one more quarter in Q3 with some headwinds, but the bottom line is our business in China is strong with this broad footprint of customers.
John Marchetti: Thanks for the color.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, John, I’d just like to point out the fact that Xiaomi was effectively – the trade restrictions were loosened, is a positive sign for us. Not so much the account of Xiaomi, but the fact that there is some progress that is being made.
John Marchetti: Got it. Thank you, Ron.
Ron Nersesian: You are welcome.
Operator: The next question will come from Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks very much for taking the question. I think in the last earnings call, the company had talked about the potential for EPS this fiscal year to grow in the mid to high teens range. And through the first half of the year and with guidance for fiscal 3Q, you’re tracking very well relative to that. So, hoping to better understand if you’re still expecting that sort of a mid to high teens growth rate and we need to be thinking about potentially a slower fiscal fourth quarter. So what would be the cause of that? Or perhaps there is now some upside to the prior commentary around EPS growth this year.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Mark, I don’t have a specific update for you to that prior number. But obviously, we exceeded the high end of our guidance range here in the second quarter. And you’ve seen our guide for Q3. So, I think at the margin, things are trending a little bit better than they were when we made that statement 3 months ago. But I don’t have a specific update for you at this point in time.
Mark Delaney: Okay. Understood. I will turn it over. Thank you.
Operator: Next question will come from Adam Thalhimer of Thompson Davis. Please go ahead.
Adam Thalhimer: Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Hey, just quickly, there was another expense in the quarter. Just curious what that was, because it did detract from the Q2 performance, it looks like.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We did a modification to our pension schemes in the Netherlands and had some settlement expense as a result as we transferred those liabilities to an insurance company.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, thanks.
Operator: Our next question will come from David Ridley-Lane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
David Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. So, I definitely heard you on Keysight having its own supply chain under control. Other companies may be struggling a lot more than you and placing orders ahead of time, trying to make sure that they get the equipment that they need. So I’m wondering, are you seeing anecdotally any sign of pull forward on orders or maybe companies placing the order earlier that would have influenced your strong order growth this quarter?
Mark Wallace: Yes, this is Mark. No, we really didn’t see any evidence of that. What we saw was some – a little bit of pent-up demand from the impact of COVID last year, which we kind of expected it to somewhat offset the trade headwinds that we talked about earlier. We watch cancellations very closely. They were at a record low for the quarter, and we’re seeing, again, this steady, broad demand. So we have no signs thus far that there is any material pull-in of orders.
Neil Dougherty: And David, if I could just add on. I like your characterization of the vertically integrated supply chain potentially making us a little bit less susceptible to some of the supply constraints than maybe others are facing. As I sit and look at it, the challenges with regard to movement control and social distancing do make it a challenge to add capacity during these times. And so I’ve talked about in the past, our seasonality being more muted at least through the first part of the year. I think those things are going to really serve to keep that kind of muted seasonality in place really through the end of this fiscal year.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the results outlook and all the details so far. My question is, there is lots of talk about double ordering and double booking, maybe from other industries like automobiles or consumer electronics or PCs and such. Or are you building in some conservatism for some double ordering or customers that may be putting in a little more orders due to the semiconductor shortage. Just kind of, kind of see if you’re building in a little bit of conservatism or simply in the test and measurement industry do companies just not double order due to the lead times in specialty configurations needed?
Mark Wallace: Yes, Jim, this is Mark. As I said earlier, we do watch for this, and there is really no evidence. Our funnel is very strong now for many months as we continue to supply our solutions. The results, as you’ve seen, are very broad-based. And unlike other industries, as you point out, oftentimes, the planning associated with customers procuring some of our systems and solutions can go out many months. So, it really doesn’t lend itself to that sort of double booking, if you will. If you look at semiconductors, one of our stronger segments, we see activities that are a year or more out in preparation for outfitting a new fab or growing capacity. So it makes it very difficult to see any sort of hedging or double booking. And as I said before, we really aren’t seeing that occur thus far.
Jim Suva: That’s what I thought. Thank you so much.
Mark Wallace: You are welcome.
Operator: Our next question will come from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Peter Zdebski: Hi. This is Peter on for Tim. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how much of the double-digit order growth in Commercial Communications was related to 5G versus the other businesses? And in particular, if you could talk a little more on the opportunity on the application layer side in light of some of these new deployments?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. So the commercial comps front, again, was broad. It covered both the wireless and wireline, so it’s 5G on the wireless side and 400 gig on the wireline side as well. We also saw some recovery in our network visibility business as enterprises are planning for return to work and thinking about what that IT infrastructure spend looks like. So those all looked favorable, so generally, a very positive dynamic. Specific to the application layer, we identified a few areas around the different end market verticals and new applications to focus on about a year ago, and that’s paying rich dividends. On the new application front, it’s the Open RAN, where it’s an open virtualized network, bringing in new customers and more players into the ecosystem. So we had strong demand for our solutions that we launched in Q1 and – Quarter one. And on the new vertical side, we gained traction with a lot of the aerospace and defense companies that are looking to invest in the DoD’s 5G program. So both those are going very well. And when we look forward, and look at the funnel for both these opportunities, they are very healthy, and they are very rich with customer – strong customer collaborations that are building.
Peter Zdebski: That’s great color. Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question will come from Rick Eastman of Baird. Please go ahead.
Rick Eastman: Thank you. Thanks again. And good quarter to be sure, and good work by the Keysight team there. Hey, just a question around maybe the backlog, and maybe let me just start for one second. Again, it looks like you built backlog again and maybe my rough math says your backlog is up maybe 15% or so year-over-year. When you provided second – or excuse me, third quarter revenue guide, is the assumption that orders or your book-to-bill will be about 1.0? Or is there an assumption that you work off some backlog into that revenue guide for fiscal Q3?
Ron Nersesian: Hi, Rick, this is Ron. Our assumption is that our book-to-bill will be about 1. And we have strong backlog, and we expect to exit Q3 with strong backlog.
Rick Eastman: Okay. Is there a lengthening in your backlog in terms of deliveries? Obviously, another supply chain question, but is there a lengthening out or are you foreseeing some ability to clear some of that backlog in Q4 by year end?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I think the most important thing at this point, we feel like we are doing a good – I am sorry, I didn’t have my microphone on. Sorry about that. I said I think the most important factor at this point is that we feel like we’re doing a good job meeting the needs of our customers and getting them the product that they need in the time lines at which they need it. And while we’re not immune to some of the supply chain constraints that are out there, I think we’re doing a good job managing them. We’re benefiting from having to vertically integrated supply chain. And we are making investments to add capacity. Obviously, our revenues are going to be up substantially year-over-year, but not just because of the soft comps, very substantially over 2019 levels as well, and we will continue to make the investments necessary that – to get products into the hands of customers.
Rick Eastman: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: It’s also worthwhile to note that if you look at software and you look at services, not only do they both have great double-digit order and double-digit revenue growth. We’ve seen more and more ARR, which is going to go into the backlog and let’s put it this way, slow a little bit how that peels off, but it will provide a great consistency of earnings as we go forward.
Neil Dougherty: It’s pointing north of $1 billion now. So that’s great, great, yes, position to be in.
Rick Eastman: $1 billion, okay. And then just a last follow-up here. Neil, on the guide for fiscal Q3, maybe the conversion – is the conversion margin here, which I’m kind of calculating maybe low 20s, is that again reflective of variable comp step up here?
Neil Dougherty: That’s correct.
Rick Eastman: Okay, alright. Very good. Thank you. Thank you again and a tremendous quarter.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question will come from Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on Satish’s earlier comments, which if I heard right, that companies are currently testing 2,000 bands, and this is going to 9,000 bands so more than a quadrupling of the testing. I guess the question is, how should we think about this, what it means for industry test capacity? I assume it’s not a one-for-one relationship there. But any color on that just higher level of intensity would be helpful.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think it’s band combinations. But you’re right that the more frequency spectrum in a heterogeneous manner that gets deployed, the test intensity goes up. And if you think of a typical device maker or companies in the O-RAN space that are putting radio and CU components together and they have to do the testing, the amount of time they have to do the testing doesn’t go up. And so essentially, some of the COVID restrictions, of social distancing and all that, essentially means that customers have – are looking at ramping up capacity for the future. But it’s a steady demand that gives us confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. That’s just one dimension of capacity. The other ones being all of the complexity associated with Release 15 deployments and now with Release 16 ramping up, we have new capabilities to offer such as what you saw with our press release with MediaTek this quarter.
Chris Snyder: I appreciate all that. And then I guess following up on the buyback. You guys bought back a lot more shares this quarter than just kind of been the historical run rate. I guess going forward, is it fair to assume that the majority of free cash is going to go to share repurchase, assuming there is no M&A.? I guess the question is, is like this $2 billion cash kind of balance the right maybe go-forward run rate to model and put everything excess into share repurchase until M&A starts coming through, until we see M&A come through?
Neil Dougherty: I think you’ve seen a pretty balanced use of capital from us. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we generated $1 billion of cash over the last four quarters. We spent $500 million on M&A, just under $500 million on share repurchase. And I would expect you continue to see balance as we look to invest in the future growth of our business. I think specifically as it relates to share repurchase, we’ve committed to at least being anti-dilutive with our buyback program. But we’ve proven, with significant buybacks both in Q4 of last year as well as in Q2 of this year, that when appropriate, we will step up and be more aggressive.
Chris Snyder: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question will come from Matthew Niknam of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, guys. This is Nick on for Matt. Congrats on the quarter. Just two quick ones. So first, on free cash flow, came in really strong this quarter. I was just wondering if you guys could provide a little bit more color on that. And kind of how free cash flow should trend moving forward? And then just the follow-up would be, obviously, some other guys or some other companies are seeing tighter gross margins because of the supply chain issues and inflation, etcetera. And so what are we – your margins are really stable here. Is that because of the in-house fabrication? Any color there would also be really helpful? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So let me take those questions. First of all, with regard to our free cash, obviously, we’re very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash penetration was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that’s a great long-term trend. And there is one significant timing difference, which we’ve already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we’ve recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there’ll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters, because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well. As it looks to gross margin, we are seeing, in some cases, some increasing input costs. But as we’ve said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long-term, if you look at our business, the push that we have, again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers’ R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you’ve seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid to upper 50s, and now we’re in the mid-60s. And so I think we’ve got a lot of great momentum in that space. And as we continue to build software in our solutions portfolio, I think there is still room for further improvement.
Operator: Your next question will come from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brandon Couillard: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, the strength in aerospace and defense was pretty impressive. Could you just talk about how you’re feeling about the durability of that current momentum? And how would you characterize the degree of visibility in terms of the both funnel there relative to history?
Mark Wallace: Yes, Brandon, this is Mark. As we’ve said, we’ve had an ongoing focus on aerospace defense and aerospace defense, both in the U.S. and around the world. The orders that we saw during the quarter were very strong across Western Europe as we saw increased program funding. Business in Asia was up. We had several strategic wins as was mentioned earlier for 5G. So the long-term growth drivers are really remaining in place around the whole defense modernization with space and satellite with the addition of 5G. And we are continuing to see our funnels continue to grow as these investments continue, so, growth across multiple regions and strengths in the next-generation technologies as they are going to be deployed over, really many years.
Brandon Couillard: One more in-market question...
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. One more point to Mark. The Biden administration has just released their first pass-through budget for ‘22, and it actually points to a higher number. That combined with any other potential technology spend from the administration, we view as a favorable dynamic.
Brandon Couillard: Got it. And then just switching gears, in terms of the auto market, it’s been soft for a few quarters now. Do you feel like that space is finally maybe beginning to start to turn the quarter, in terms of investments in sort of next-gen programs?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. The automotive market had a very solid quarter in quarter two and is driven by some return to normalcy for manufacturing. And I know that as the automotive end market production is projected to increase in the second half that should be a favorable dynamic for the business. But consistent with what we saw even through last year, the demand for R&D offerings in auto continues to be steady. We actually saw an uptick in that, especially around EV and AV. And our funnel for the automotive EV offerings that we have is very strong looking into the second half. We just launched solutions to solidify our EV portfolio in charging test, and we continue to see a long runway for those offerings.
Brandon Couillard: Great, thanks.
Operator: Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. And now I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Well, thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming conferences and just wish you a good day. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders driven by growth across all regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue and earnings growth above guidance. And third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year. Despite a short term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation, which is due to the high near term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth in Fiscal 2021. Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2 billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade restrictions, adjusting for this impact both orders and revenue grew solid double digits. We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution and enabled by the strengthen discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin at 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of $267 million. Turning to our markets, aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders and revenue 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research. In commercial communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total, as well as for 5G, while revenue declined 3%. Adjusting to the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications orders grew double digits and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and 800G Ethernet for data centers. Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market makers in standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the application layer as momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021. We make great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance, and security of multi-vendor 5G networks. We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry-leaders like Xilinx, Radisys, ArrayComm and Altiostar. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired [indiscernible], a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. [Indiscernible] offerings complement our end-to-end solutions portfolio, providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless network, out through over-the-air analytics. Record revenue for Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was driven by double-digit growth in semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investment in next generation process technologies, bolstered by new customer wins in China as we successfully redeployed our salesforce to capitalize on new opportunities. General electronic strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro challenges, end demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated in Asia and in the Americas. In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with ElringKlinger, one of the world's leading Cisco partners to the automotive industry. They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Combined, they were approximately one-third of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthen the durability of our business model with increasing recurring revenue. In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets entering the year. Now, I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions. First Quarter revenue of $1,180 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% or 6% on a core basis. Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a boat to build just over one. We achieved first quarter orders of $1,223 billion, of 7% or 5% on a core basis, successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions. Turning to operational results for Q1. Reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $439 million were well-managed, resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. We achieve net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communication Solutions Group generated record first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4% was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 26%. In Q1, commercial communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders. First Quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with commercial communications disproportionately impacted by the China trade restrictions. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower spending from direct government customers as we saw less than expected disruption from the U.S. administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328 million of 18% or 13% on a core basis. Orders in revenue for our semiconductor and general electronics measurement solutions broke through double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. EISD reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported a cash flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under a share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the open market and an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter in which I stated that flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY 2021, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating margin. Just as we flexed expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, we will flex up this year particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,190 billion to $1,210 billion, which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing we're entering the year with the order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid to high teens earnings growth for the full fiscal year. With that I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Sideris, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rick Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Could you perhaps maybe just kind of walk through a little bit of the operating leverage that we really saw in both Commercial Communication Solutions Group? But I'm kind of looking at the out profit number of 170. Is that with the gross margin maybe down? Is that primarily all mix or maybe give us a little bit of a feel for that. And maybe the same question around EISG. Just significant operating leverage there. I'm curious how much of this mix versus volume. That's a new word for it?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, Rick, This is Neil. I think you've hit on it right. Q4 was a very favorable -- if you're looking sequentially -- Q4 was a very favorable gross margin quarter for us as we really significantly ramped production after the COVID disruptions of Q2 and Q3. And I think just the nature of us responding to immediate customer demand for urgent delivery, kind of shifted the mix in a favorable direction in the fourth quarter. I think what we saw in the first quarter was the return to more normalized mix. It aligns with kind of the quarters leading it up to Q4 as well as slightly lower volume. And I think that that comment is basically true across both the Communications Group as well as EISG. There's nothing really specific in either one of the two businesses.
Ron Nersesian: And you also look at the long-term model that we outlined at analysts day for FY 2023, obviously, our performance shows very strong against that and we have no doubt that we'll be able to deliver to that level going forward.
Richard Eastman: Great. And then just a quick question, maybe if I could. I'm surprised to see the order growth and it basically looks like you held your backlog up, kind of in the low 20s year-over-year -- 20% year-over-year. I think my math quickly says 23% year-over-year on the backlog side. I know you spoke to orders being strong across geographies, across product lines. Is there any particular place that you might flag whether it be geography, or between the two business segments where you were pleasantly surprised with your order growth in the quarter?
Ron Nersesian: I'll mention a couple and then I'll let Mark chime in with a little more detail. First of all, if you look at China, our China orders were down 6% and we expected them to be down much more because of the effects of the China trade restrictions with Huawei. If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance. Our Chinese salesforce was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts within the geography and we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of the type of results that we did do. So that was clearly one. India was also very strong. Japan was very strong -- both of those well into double digits, as well as Europe, which also hit double digit performance. Mark, you may want to add a couple more regional comments?
Mark Wallace: Sure. Ron covered it really well, Rick, but I would just add that about half our growth in China overcoming the headwinds was from new customers. Again, showing how we're executing and rotating to both new opportunities and new customers and we want additional business with our existing customers, whether that be around 5G to some of the long tail of customers, 400-gigabit Tier 2 customers. And I was very pleased with semiconductor, very strong growth again, both from existing large customers, as well as acquiring two new fabulous semiconductor customers in the quarter in China. Very strong results in Japan for 5G and aerospace defense. And then if you look at Europe, it really was a story of this very broad demand across multiple end markets. We had growth across most of our countries across Europe. And it really goes to show the strength of our portfolio and the depth of our penetration into all these end markets.
Ron Nersesian: Let me add just a couple more comments, Rick. One, our general electronics business was up in orders over 20% and that's a really good sign. That talks about the macro environment in the industrial markets. So, we're very pleased to see that and also our overall corporate strategy and moving to more software-centric solutions, which requires more software and more services. Both software and services. Both grew double digits in orders again this quarter.
Richard Eastman: Very good. Congrats. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investment. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much and really good job on the results in an unclear uncertain environment. My question is a little bit more, just to help us out looking forward. Not so much on the trade and tariff stuff, but recently the supply chain with the freezing in Texas and chip shortages, can you talk to us a little bit about do you have some buffer chips that you're okay for the next three to six months? Or are you tempering your outlook a little bit? I'm just kind of a little bit concerned about the procurement cycle. Seems to have this additional variable. And then my second question is on OpEx. How should we be thinking about that as hopefully COVID becomes behind us at some point? Thank you so much.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, I'll cover the procurement piece and then I'll let Neil talk a little bit more on the OpEx formula going forward. As far as procurement we have taken into account the long lead time cycles that we're seeing from semiconductor providers, as well as the other environmental impacts that we're seeing around the world. As a matter of fact, we have just put out guidance for the midpoint is at $1.2 billion for the next quarter and that takes into account the semi-cycles. We do hope though, that things don't get worse from the standpoint of COVID -- another surge, although we feel very confident that we are in good shape to come out with this guidance, which was above the street consensus for the next quarter.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, and, Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as are related to OpEx. And I made some comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable, going forward. But we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters -- well, not the only impact, by far the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal drivers the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. That variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin and in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore higher revenue growth like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year. Our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So, as you saw we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect the sequential increases results in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. And since all of our non-executive employees are participants in that variable pay program, that increase is split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D, and SG&A. Specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. But again, important to note that the underlying investment level is stable and once we get past Q3, our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels.
Jim Suva: Thank you, and congratulations again, to you and your team. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. And just to finish that up, if you take a look at our overall model, we think it's a short-term effect and that's why for one of the few times we've guided out for the whole year producing EPS growth in the teens as we had mentioned in our prepared remarks.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could just take a moment and talk about some of the strength that you continue to see in 5G? How much of that maybe is coming from new customers, as you sort of hinted at in the comment about the older strength? And how much of it is maybe moving into different variants of 5G? Whether it's standalone, versus non, or Millimeter Wave versus sub-6G?
Ron Nersesian: Satish, feel free to answer this question.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll take that, Ron. I think one of the effects in 5G that we're seeing as deployments of scaling is the broader interest in deploying this technology across different end market verticals. And that as a result of expanding the ecosystem, as we have talked about this quarter, we added over 100 new customers to our 5G platform. So that's that continues to be strong. At the highest level, I think we've stated its growth across all regions, for 5G and all parts of the ecosystem. So, it is broad and we see sort of four teams. Right? You look at the R&D investment cycle, there's new teams such as [indiscernible] and O-RAN that are capturing interest, manufacturing opportunities, scale as 5g deploys, and it's profitable manufacturing as we have talked about as select manufacturing strategy. And -- is the interest in this technology from new verticals such as aerospace, defense, automotive, and industrial. And finally we see this long term steady push to commercialize Millimeter Wave as we've talked about is a long term dynamic for our business, which has got an upgrade pattern and to feed this momentum, we've just announced over 30 new product introductions this quarter and we feel confident about the projections based on everything we see in the industry.
John Marchetti: And maybe just as a follow up there, Satish, you guys have mentioned in the past, you think this market sort of peaked out in 2022 or 2023 for you. I'm curious if that's still the case, or if you think with some of these newer things coming on, that actually extends it out a little bit?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think based on what we have seen in the past, I think we've sort of seen an industry CapEx projected to peak due to the Millimeter Wave parts of 5G being deployed. However, for our business, in comms, we have a broad portfolio of both wired and wireless and the end-to-end portfolio that we have created, not only has sort of a poor incident effect, but as Ron referenced, higher software content, higher services, so we're much more plugged in and able to monetize the lifecycle value from our early, lead.
John Marchetti: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from one of Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan, your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Joker [ph] on for Samik. So my first question is just around aerospace, and electronic industrial business again. Obviously, you had two great quarters of execution in a row. I guess how should we think of the sustainability, the momentum in both those segments? And what is driving your content?
Mark Wallace: Ron, should I take…
Ron Nersesian: Sure.
Satish Dhanasekaran: As far as aerospace, defense is concerned, very pleased record orders and record revenues. And as we mentioned before, the strength is coming across all the regions, tracking the COVID recovery or macro recovery. And that's probably a common dynamic between our aerospace, defense business and the general electronics business in our industrial segment. Specifically, on the aerospace defense, our portfolios focus on defense modernization, in particular around these new teams continue to position us well. The passage of the NDAA or the budget in the United States in December, we feel cautiously optimistic about the outlook for that business as we look forward. And we also have a pretty healthy, healthy backlog into the business. So, we continue to expect strong growth the next couple of quarters. As far as the EISG business is concerned, again, broad strength from our general electronics business, but also semiconductor where we're seeing increased investments driven by the advanced nodes and the China IC investment that Mark referenced earlier.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it.
Ron Nersesian: I would also comment that different form factors are contributing to that such as our modular solutions, had a very strong quarter, as well as software and services that have been mentioned earlier, all play into this general electronics market and the overall EISG market.
Unidentified Analyst: I appreciate the color. And then just a quick follow up. You, guys kind of went into detail about the 5G and the momentum that you're seeing there. I'm just curious, can we get an update on how you're seeing the declines play out on the 4G side? I know last year, because COVID, there was obviously a big impact there, but are we seeing declines starting to moderate on the 4G side?
Mark Wallace: Yes, sequentially. 4G has been flat quarter-over-quarter for us and we're very pleased with the uptake in 5G as I referenced. It was a record quarter and was and if you include 5G and 4G together, we've grown at year-over-year and sequentially quarter-over-quarter. We feel we feel good about the portfolio and I did mention that we've launched 30 new products this quarter to feed that momentum in the market.
Unidentified Analyst: Got it. Appreciate the color, guys. Congrats on the results.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. One follow with Satish. Can you please help me understand the mix of a 400-gig and 800-gig ethernet as a mixer for overall communication sector group? And how do you see that trending especially as the volume brand for 400-gig plays out in the second half? And for Neil, it would be great if you could give us some reference. I think there was a mention of software and services accounting for one-third of the revenue. Can you give us a qualitative or quantitative assessment of what the mix of software is? Where was it a year ago? And how should we be thinking about the software mix looking forward?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll maybe start with the 400-gig question, Mehdi. As we have really done very well with the wireline technology evolutions over the number of years and last year was a pretty strong year for 400-gig, I think we've referenced it on calls. And what we saw this quarter was a broader adaption of 400-gig technologies, still heavily driven by data center demand, which is adapting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale. We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long tail customers in Asia in particular and we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur, that more of that demand will start to shift in the telco or Metro opportunities. So, we're still on the frontend of that. I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D, which we expect to play out in in production in 18 to 24 months. So, we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced the full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business. As far as the software, I'll kick it off, and maybe Neil can make a comment. We see for our double-digit growth in software coming from our pathway design franchise and from the 5G solutions, which as we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them. We're also seeing renewals for subscription contracts become important to our 5G growth, which I think helps us with the ARR. I'll just pass it off to Neil.
Neil Dougherty: Just in terms of the relative size of software, we've said previously that software is approximately 20% of total revenues. And as the Satish has mentioned, it continues to outgrow the broader business, growing double digits again this quarter. So that mix is increasing slowly over time and we expect that it will continue to do so as we continue this migration towards more complete solutions with higher software content.
Mehdi Hosseini: If I may, just a quick follow up for Neil here. If you execute and deliver the software growth above the top line, could that be potentially a source of gross margin upside that could potentially drive EPS growth this year towards the mid to high teens?
Neil Dougherty: Certainly, over the long run, we see increasing software content as a driver of gross margin. I think you've seen that over the past couple of years as we've added software to our portfolio, as well as taking other actions to drive our gross margins northward. You know, the, the mix shift, it's not dramatic. It's slow and steady over time. So, hard for me to draw a direct link between a mixed shift over the next couple of quarters and immediate EPS increases, there's a lot of things that are going to go into -- they're going to play a role in determining that level over the course of the next several quarters. But generally speaking, yes, our software growth is absolutely contributing to our gross margin improvement over time.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Well also, so if you're looking for the short term, or big orders, where to go ahead and where to exceed our projections, when you take a look at our incrementals, we have delivered to our model and then some pretty much consistently over the last five years. And we expect to continue to do so. Ms: Yes. And I was just trying to understand how conservative is that method, high-teen EPS growth? And how should we think about upsides from there?
Satish Dhanasekaran: I think you can see in our guide that we're very encouraged by the market and our performance in the business on the top line. We do have some short term expense pressures over the couple of quarters that will put some pressure on EPS relative to normal incremental, over the quarter or where the incrementals would otherwise have been over the course of the next several quarters. But by Q4, we're kind of lapped those comps than the impact that they have on our business where we return to kind of more normalized levels.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, thanks, guys.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs, your line is open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to dig more into the full-year EPS growth commentary of mid to high teens in recognizing the very good or that the company just reported for the quarter. If my math is right, the implied second half EPS growth is relatively flattish to slightly higher, year-over-year, 5% or 10% or so. And yes, I understand the higher variable comp, which makes a lot of sense and is good news. But is there anything else besides the variable comp that you're trying to factor into the implied EPS growth guidance that you're discussing today? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: The only thing I mentioned earlier is that, our Q4 gross margins in last year were extraordinarily favorable. Right? Not only do we have the highest revenue quarter we'd had by a pretty significant margin, we had significantly higher gross margins than we'd ever had previously. So, we are going to have a tough year-over-your comp in the fourth quarter that is going to factor into that ultimate equation as well.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful and make sense. My question was on the 5G order strength and the strength that the companies have seen within Millimeter Wave. Can you describe to what extent you're seeing some increased adaption of Millimeter Wave in different geographies and perhaps the opportunity for Millimeter Wave deployments to help your business in China? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, thank you. I think as we have referenced before, the Millimeter Wave opportunity is a long term one for us. We see a very steady increase in interest from our customers. At this point, heavily driven by the U.S. bans. You can think of 20 gigahertz to 40 gigahertz sort of spectrum. And with new spectrum coming online, the 66 gigahertz to 90 gigahertz range, I think that tends to sow the seeds for the runway. We're talking about China's 2022 Winter Olympics, we expect it to be a push with a showcase of Millimeter Wave. So those are clearly drivers. And then if you look even further out, you start thinking about some early research occurring the terahertz space. So again, this is a very long-term opportunity. Keysight's got a competitive differentiation. We have talked about this and we're well-positioned to address this. Currently, we're working with customers to solve some critical challenges in commercializing Millimeter Wave like in advanced beam management, peak higher data rates, 10 gigabits per second and above. It's a long term dynamic and we are well-positioned there.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Good afternoon. This is Peter [ph] on for Tim. Congratulations on the results. On CSG, just again, as we see the 400G cycle coming closer, could you help us parse out what that has meant for you between your wireline hardware business versus the network and ability side and the essence of what inning we are in that cycle from that testing measure perspective? And then also on A&D. How should we think about what this very strong Q1 here implies for Q2 seasonality out? Just going off this very strong pace?
Ron Nersesian: I didn't hear your question. Could you please repeat it?
Unidentified Analyst: I'm sorry. Is this better?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. If you could slow down just a touch. That would help.
Unidentified Analyst: Sure. I was just asking on CSG. Just as we see the 400G cycle coming closer, I was wondering if you could help us parse out what that has meant for you between the wireline hardware side versus the network visibility side? And do you have a sense of what inning we are in that cycle from a test measurement perspective? And then just a follow up on A&D, was wondering how we should think about Q2 seasonality, given the starting strong Q1 base?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I'll take the aerospace, defense first. Again, record orders and given the comps from the favorable comms, we have for the next couple of quarters. We expect strong revenue performance in the business and our focus areas around defense modernization are also aligned with some of the strategic priorities of the governments around the world. So we feel good about where we are in the business. With regard to your question on wireline, the entire portfolio of wireline involves the focus in three areas if you think of it. The focus on high speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig, terahertz and terabit ethernet and beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest. And the third area is on visibility. Clearly, we're the drivers for the business right now are 400-gig and 800-gig. In terms of the visibility business, we expect or we're everything we hear and we see the pipeline building towards it is a recovery in enterprise IT span, which would be a good peg. And that to occur as folks return back to work or in a hybrid mode later on in the year. So that's probably a driver for that part of the business. But overall, we're pleased with the synergies we're seeing and you see that reflected in the strength of our commercial communications business this quarter.
Unidentified Analyst: Great, thank you for the color.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. Good evening. Since you've done the math on the impacts from trade restrictions on both orders and revenue, what was the estimated headwind for both of those?
Ron Nersesian: It was roughly six to seven points at the Keysight level. Obviously heavily skewed to CSGs specifically to commercial comm. So, I think if you get to the commercial comms level, it was a double digit headwind for the commercial communications business.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it.
Ron Nersesian: Putting the record orders for commercial comms in contact, we were extraordinarily pleased with that result given the China trade headwinds on that business.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it? Okay. And then, since no one else has picked up on it, I'll ask. Can you tell us a little bit more on the acquisition that you closed. I think it was about $100 million or so from cash flow revenue. How it fits into the portfolio? And it seems like it's in a very fast-growing part of the market. So, kind of what's your near-term revenue expectations as well?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, maybe I'll start by saying, it's a smaller acquisition. Roughly half point to the Keysight revenue as an estimate, and it's highly profitable, and it aligns with our M&A strategy of focusing on software-centric product categories, and more importantly, enables us to complete the customer workflow -- plays into the interoperability testing space, which enables customers to resolve complex system issues. And given that the 5G deployments are taking place at scale at new trends, like Open RAN are disaggregating more of what used to be a monolithic block. We believe this acquisition will really help us continue our momentum within the commercial comms business.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then last one for me. You're now in a net cash position. How do you think about Keysight's ability to be more aggressive on share repurchase? Is being in a net caps position aligned for you?
Neil Dougherty: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Our first objective, obviously, is to grow the business and provide a great return above our wax. So we continue to look for M&A opportunities that can further our strategy. But again, if we can't go ahead and produce you know an hourly [indiscernible], we're not going to spend it. So, you can see we're very deliberate and we're very focused and we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is our first priority. The second thing if we had excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw on Q4, where average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase. And then third would be to do something like a dividend that we're far from that at this point. But still, first, we're going ahead and making sure after organic growth is funded through over $700 million in R&D. Second, it's to look for M&A that could go ahead and enhance our growth and produce a higher return on invested capital. Third, clearly is to look for opportunistic share buybacks. which we have done and we plan to make sure we're at least anti-diluted, like we've stated before, but we will get a little bit more aggressive if we see a very big opportunity.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Adam Thalhimer from Thomas [ph] Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Close enough. Hi, guys. Great quarter.
Neil Dougherty: Thanks, Adam.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Shoot, this might be a waste of question, but I got to ask about the Biden administration and Huawei. There have been some early indications that maybe some of their restrictions get eased. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts on that?
Ron Nersesian: Well, we don't have any particular insight as to what the Biden administration will do. But I'm very pleased that we were concerned about having to have that in our compare and to go ahead and seeing what that would do to our top line when we had to go ahead and stop selling, according to the government laws. And we're very, very pleased that we reported double-digit quarter growth and revenue growth outside at our other accounts in order to basically smooth right over that. So, if things were to change at Huawei or with any other government restrictions, that would certainly be significant upside for us.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay, thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.
Operator: Your next question comes from a lot of Chris Snyder from UBS. Your line is open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. So, just following up on the capital allocation. The company finished the quarter with $1.9 billion of cash, which is certainly well above historical levels. What do you view to be the optimal level of cash to keep on hand? And is there a willingness to go after larger acquisition targets? Because while there's been a steady stream of bolt-on type acquisitions, it feels like that is a little bit difficult to kind of right-size, the cash balance with these just bolt-ons alone?
Ron Nersesian: Sure, well, I'll just say this, that we have looked at over 300 different acquisitions. And again, we're very selective. We've made about a dozen at this point and you're right, most of them have been smaller, except for two of them. And we continue to look for a large and small things that fit into our strategy. But there is a very high hurdle for the large acquisitions, obviously, the upside, is much as much more significant. But when you look at the premium and the amount of dollars that you have to make up in the premium you pay for a company, we want to make sure that pays off for the shareholders. We have more cash than we need to run the company right now. But we are aggressively looking at M&A and unfortunately, we can't share much more than that. Neil, you may have something else you want to add?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, the only thing I was going to add is that the optimal level of cash -- I would agree with Ron, we have we have more cash than we currently need. But the optimal level of cash is a lot of things that go into that and it fluctuates over time. And we're looking to put that cash to work either through value creating M&A or looking for opportunities to return it in a favorable fashion, like we did in the Q4 of last year. So, we'll continue to continue to do that.
Chris Snyder: Thank you for that. And then just for the second question, can you talk about the pricing environment, both for CSG and EISG? And what level of positive pricing, if any, is baked into the company's mid-single digit long term core growth targets?
Ron Nersesian: We always look at pricing depending on what's going on in the market and how much our differentiation is in a particular segment. So clearly, if there's a lot of competition, we don't have differentiation that it's that great, we cannot go ahead and utilize too much pricing power. But what we're doing in 5G is certainly unique. We're on the leadership end and not only in different products, but when you look across the workflow and we look for opportunities to do so but we're not going to gouge our customers. We want to make sure that we have a good long-term environment and they stick with us. So, we review our pricing at a minimum twice a year and we look for opportunities for price increases and we will continue to do so to drive our margins higher or to offset inflation. But as far as what the amount is, that's something that we do not state publicly.
Chris Snyder: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Chris.
Operator: Your next question comes from a line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Most of my questions have been covered. But, Ron, I don't think you mentioned any call on the auto market specifically yet. Curious, latest thoughts there? And if there has been kind of any turn perhaps in the order trends in that market? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Well, I'll let Satish answer this. We've been focusing certainly on the battery test and the overall infrastructure for EV. We have mentioned a nice the win that we had in the prepared remarks earlier, and we continue to be in good position in that space. Also, as we look at autonomous vehicles, it's the same thing. But as far as the market, we've seen the market a little bit more depressed, as we all know, in auto and I'll let Satish get a chance to comment on where he sees that going.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. And thanks, Ron. We're seeing signs of slow recovery in the auto market. The business is definitely stabilizing, the manufacturing parts of the business have depressed a strong reference. But there is a steady focus on next gen R&D with AV and EV applications. Definitely the push around the world for more electrification, we view as a long-term opportunity and we're focused on creating value to help extend the ranges, help with interoperability needs by implementing global standards, including in China and focusing on bidirectional charging applications. With 5G in particular, we have a differentiated position on C-V2X technology that we're continuing to progress. So, this may be a market where as the as the auto end market recovers, we start to see even bigger traction, especially in EV and AV. That's our expectation, but our portfolio is strong and we continue to be engaged with customers.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. And, Neil, would you remind us just what the China trade headwind is on a year-over-year basis to the top line in the second quarter? That a similar sort of 6% to 7%?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, what we said what we said before was that it was 5% on the half, obviously skewed towards Q1. We've just told you Q1 was 6%, so Q2 is in the 3% to 4%-ish range.
Brandon Couillard: Got you. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Hi. Thanks, Sedaris. no further comments. I just like to thank everyone for joining us today and wish you all a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding quarter to finish our fiscal year driven by strong execution and broad-based demand for our differentiated solutions. Despite COVID-related macro challenges, it was a record year for orders, gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. Today, I'll focus my comments on three key headlines. First, we delivered exceptional fourth quarter results driven by strong execution as demand for Keysight's next-generation technology solutions continued, and end-market demand began to recover. Second, record profitability and cash flow again demonstrated the durability and strength of our financial operating model despite a challenging macroeconomic environment. And third, our long-term outlook for revenue and earnings growth is strong, and we haven't wavered from our pre-COVID long-term financial commitments and growth expectations announced in March of this year. The power of Keysight's leadership model and our execution this year underscore our ability to deliver on these commitments which includes 46% long-term core revenue growth and achieving 26% to 27% sustainable annual operating margin by no later than fiscal year 2023. Now, let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, broad-based demand for Keysight's solutions drove strong results across the business as the economic recovery in certain sectors gained momentum. Record orders of $1.2 billion exceeded revenue and grew 3% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. We achieved fourth quarter revenue growth of 9% year-over-year with growth across all regions. Both, the Communications and Electronic Industrial Solutions Groups achieved record revenue in the quarter. The resilience of our financial operating model resulted in an all-time high profitability and cash flow. In Q4, we delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 29%, and earnings of $1.62 per share, and free cash flow of $308 million. For the year and despite COVID-related macro challenges and supply chain disruption, orders grew to $4.5 billion, an all-time high for Keysight. As you recall, in Q2, we responded to government directors to limit the spread of coronavirus and closed the majority of our offices worldwide, including our order fulfillment and manufacturing operations. We then ramped back up our production capacity in Q3. Despite this significant disruption, full year revenue of $4.2 billion declined only 2% year-over-year. Even in a difficult operating environment, we continue to deliver on our margin expansion commitments. Both, gross margin and operating margin improved by over 100 basis points generating a record $4.85 per share in earnings in fiscal year 2020. Turning to our markets; the Communications Solutions Group record quarterly revenue was driven by growth across the aerospace, defense and government, and commercial communications. Aerospace, defense and government revenue increased 13% year-over-year in Q4, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia, as defense modernizations continues to drive investments in technology with the focus on electromagnetic spectrum operations, space, and new commercial technologies like 5G. In Commercial Communications, 5G technology is scaling and drove strong demand across the design lifecycle from development to deployment. Keysight has the industry's most comprehensive range of 5G design and test solutions enabling the global buildout of networks and devices. 5G has been a strong growth driver for us for over the past three years, and we continue to see new use cases and ongoing innovation as the ecosystem scales and adapts to a new technology. A recent example of our 5G solutions approach includes collaboration on O-RAN with many industry leaders. Investment continues across the Commercial Communications market spanning wireless and wired technologies in data centers, and also in the cloud. This quarter, we announced a new high performance PXIe modular 5G base station solution. It is enabling network equipment manufacturers and small cell vendors to accelerate their time to market. This solution also incorporates enhancements from our PathWave software platform that help automate some of the current workflow limitations. Within Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, orders and revenue for our broad portfolio of general electronics solutions, both grew double-digit driven by gradual economic recovery across most regions and improvement in the education market. Demand for our semiconductor measurement solutions was again strong this quarter as investment in next-generation process technologies continued. In automotive, while macro-driven weakness continues to weigh on the sector, strategic investment in the advanced automotive technology is a market priority; we saw improvement from last quarter as orders grew double-digit sequentially across all regions. Our Scienlab electric vehicle test solutions are expanding in Asia and Europe where government mandates are driving the electrification of vehicles. We continue to add to our solutions portfolio and [pressing] [ph] challenges in the development of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, and ensuring compliance to important standards. In Q4, we introduced a new radar target simulator for ADAS being developed to enable autonomous driving, as well as a new solution for testing automotive Ethernet standards compliance for in-vehicle networks. We also recently announced collaborations with SGS and Qualcomm to advanced testing of cellular vehicle-to-everything or C-V2X technology. Turning to software and services, combined they were one-third of total Keysight revenue for this year after another quarter of solid growth. In addition, recurring revenue increased from 18% of total in FY '19 to 21% in FY '20. On an annualized basis, recurring revenue grew high-teens over last year. Software and services are important elements of our solution-centric strategy and differentiation, and further strengthened the durability of our business model. In Q4, we launched new and enhanced solutions to tap the power of cloud-based processing and advanced analytics to speed design simulation, validation and manufacturing test. These include several new PathWave software solutions targeting advanced design, compliance test, automation, and measurement and manufacturing analytics. Increasingly complex designs and the volume of data associated with their validation are driving demand for Keysight solutions. Keysight's execution and financial performance this year is a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values, and our commitment to corporate social responsibility. A year ago, I shared with our teams my top priorities for the company. One of these priorities was a specific focus on increasing our inclusion and diversity efforts. In support of this priority, I appointed a new Senior Director of Inclusion and Diversity, who has been working with Keysight leaders and external organizations to increase representation of diverse groups within our workforce. We place a high value on inclusion and diversity at all levels of our organization, including the Board of Directors. We continue to make progress, and I'm pleased to share that as of today, over 30% of our U.S. executives are diverse in gender, race, and/or ethnicity. Before I turn the call over to Neil, I'd like to sincerely thank all of our Keysight employees for their relentless commitment, engagement, and dedication to our success over the past year. Our people and culture are truly a competitive differentiator. Thanks to their efforts, and in the face of unprecedented challenges, Keysight exits this year stronger than ever and is very well positioned to capitalize on our growth opportunities ahead. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I begin, please note, that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and despite a challenging macro environment, we continued to make great progress towards our long-term annual financial targets. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we delivered record revenue of $1.220 billion, which was above the high-end of our guidance range, and grew 9% or 7% on a core basis. Q4 revenue growth was driven by continued demand in areas such as 5G, semiconductor measurement, and aerospace defense where we have leading positions and differentiated solutions. Demand for general electronics improved significantly in the quarter driven by regional economic recovery, particularly in Asia. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue in Q4 with the book-to-bill just over 1 [ph]. We delivered a record $1.231 billion in orders, up 3% or 1% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q4; we reported gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $446 million resulting in operating margin of 29%, an all-time quarterly high. Net income was a record $305 million, and we achieved $1.62 in earnings per share which was well above the high-end of our guidance, and an increase of 22% year-over-year. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments; our Communication Solutions Group generated record revenue of $901 million, up 8% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 29%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $605 million, up 5% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem from development to early manufacturing, Gen5 high-speed digital applications and data center related 400 gigabit and 800 gigabit technology. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $296 million, an increase of 13% versus a prior all-time high in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by strength in the Americas and Asia with improvement in Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $319 million, up 12% or 7% on a core basis, driven by strength in general electronics and semiconductor. EISG reported gross margin of 65%, an increase of 230 basis points year-over-year and record operating margin of 30%. Given the challenges that we faced this year, we are very pleased with our full year results. FY '20 revenue totaled $4.2 billion, down 2% year-over-year or 3% on a core basis impacted by supply chain disruptions and macro challenges caused by the pandemic. Despite this small revenue decline, gross margin improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 65%. While continuing to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or nearly $700 million for the year, operating margin improved 130 basis points to 25%. This year-over-year improvement demonstrates strong progress towards our annual operating margin target of 26% to 27% which we expect to achieve by fiscal 2023. FY '20 non-GAAP net income was $919 million or $4.85 per share for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our fourth quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and reported cash flow from operations of $338 million and record free cash flow of $308 million. Free cash flow is net of a $100 million funding contribution to our U.S. pension plan in the quarter, which provides a tax benefit in the current year and a pension expense benefit in FY '21. Total free cash flow for the year was $899 million, representing 21% of revenue and 98% of non-GAAP net income. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we were opportunistic in deploying capital during the quarter. We acquired approximately 2.2 million shares on the open market at an average price of $96.55 for a total consideration of $215 million and exhausting our $500 million share repurchase authorization from May of 2019. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.3 million shares at an average share price of $95.90 for a total consideration of $410 million or 46% of free cash flow. As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $750 million, effective immediately. Before moving to FY '21 modeling and our Q1 guidance, I'd like to provide a brief update on global trade concerns. We admittedly have a tough order comp in Q1 due to China trade restrictions and the pending U.S. administration change, which has historically dampened government business during the transition. Despite these headwinds, we have started to see gradual improvements in many of our markets and are entering the year in a strong backlog position giving us confidence in our ability to navigate these near-term perturbations. Looking to FY '21, we expect quarterly revenue seasonality to be more muted than in the past due to ongoing COVID-19 and macro-related uncertainty. Just as we flexed expenses down this year, flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 to more normal levels, with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. In addition, FY '21 pension expenses reflected in the other expense line are expected to increase by $5 million per quarter. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital spending is expected to be in the range of $170 million to $180 million as we begin a two-year project to increase the resiliency of our supply chain. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '21. Now turning to our outlook and guidance; we expect first quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.140 billion to $1.160 billion, and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. In closing, our solid outlook for revenue and earnings growth coupled with the durability of our business model give us confidence in our ability to deliver on the long-term financial commitments that we outlined in March prior to COVID. Despite the challenges of this past year, we continue to make good progress towards our long-term targets of 4% to 6% core revenue growth and annual operating margin of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Chris, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to your booking and better understand specific to Commercial Communication, how should I think about orders for 5G, specifically millimeter wave, and how does the networking, like fiber for 800-gig, compare to millimeter wave related orders? And I have a follow-up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks, Mehdi. This is Satish, I'll take it. Our Commercial Communications group had a record revenue this quarter and second consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and a large part of these results were driven by strength in both the wireless and wireline ecosystems, specifically from a trend perspective, 5G and 400-gig were big drivers of growth for us. I would say, in 5G while -- we observed three things, the commercialization is ramping, a large part of that is low frequency or mid-band frequency networks; the standardization of the technology continues to progress; and the big theme is the ecosystem is expanding. So these are three big trends that are enabling both wireless and wireline technologies to be strong for us. As far as the millimeter wave is concerned, we view the -- we have long viewed and we continue to view the millimeter wave opportunity as very favorable for us because of the upgrade potential it represents and our traditional strengths in millimeter wave technologies play out. Even this quarter, specifically, we continue to see a steady ramp in customer interest as they re-tool their engineering flow to adapt to the millimeter wave technology. On the wireline side, we captured pretty strong ramps that occurred for 400-gig in Asia throughout the year and we are starting to see increased activity in R&D for 400-gig and 800-gig Ethernet this quarter.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay, just a quick follow-up, as we look into FY 2021, 5G goes into production, how should I think about the software content? This question actually ties into the last question, as we go into production, should we expect continued strength in R&D, specifically R&D that is software-heavy and, in that context, would the gross margin hold up as we go into production 5G, should we expect some gross margin headwind? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Mehdi, as far as R&D, we continue to see a robust pipeline for demand for R&D with release 16 features coming out next year. So I would continue to see strength there. With regard to our production test opportunities, we're starting to see the deployments are actually driving ramps in the supply chain and we're benefiting from them and in fact, this quarter we referenced a pretty sizable win for our PXIe, a release of our PXIe modular solution, which also has software content associated with it. So, we'll continue to see a steady improvement there, as well.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, I'd certainly expect any margin impact from a migration towards manufacturing to be more or less undetectable at the Keysight level when you think about $4.5 billion of revenue and the progress we're making generally, as a company around software and services and other areas. So, not something that we're concerned about.
Mehdi Hosseini: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. If I can just start off with Commercial Communications as well, and just following up on Satish's commentary here on 5G momentum being strong. I just wanted to see if you can outline how to think about maybe acceleration in terms of 5G, the revenue momentum and how does that play into what declines to expect on the 4G revenue side, any thoughts as we look into the next couple of years on that front? I think one of your competitors has also talked about some of the 5G release delays driving order weakness, have you seen anything on that front?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, there is no doubt there has been some implementation delays in some quarters of the ecosystem. If it were not for this -- given the momentum that the industry is sustaining, we would be further along. Having said that, we saw strong orders for our business, the quarter and for the full year in 5G and we see a robust pipeline for release 16 in R&D and for production-related expansions that customers are planning for. So we continue to believe that 5G represents a long-term opportunity for us, especially as we have talked about our portfolio being broad starting with the physical layer where we have millimeter wave -- bulk of the millimeter wave opportunity in front of us and then, we have the protocol layer where release 16 and release 17 to follow where there has been some delays in release 17 that you referenced, but release 16 is very high impact in terms of its expansion into new use cases that we're very excited about. And lastly, I would say that we saw strong growth in the application layer opportunity where we've expanded our 5G strength even beyond commercial comps into aerospace and defense, with security applications, into our general electronics business through multiple industries, and into automotive with C-V2X. So you piece that altogether, we continue to believe that this is still very early innings in 5G as we stated at Investor Day.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. Satish, if I can just follow-up, what are you seeing in terms of activity on the 4G side, are we at a point where some of these revenue declines moderate on the 4G side?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think we've -- obviously the year-over-year, if you looked at last year, we saw some expansions in traditional smartphone driving up the legacy of 4G business and so, comparatively things declined sharper this year given that customers prioritized 5G, but again, I would go back to saying we have a very broad breadth of tools for the labs that we offer and in many cases, customers delayed that spend and we expect that to stabilize and ramp back up, as customers return and recover from COVID.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay, thank you. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator: Our next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. If I could just follow-up with one on the 5G side, then ask on optical. Just talk a little bit about the pricing and competitive environment as some of the competitors try to play a little catch up there. Any changes of note? And then secondly, you mentioned some strength in the data center 400-gig, 800-gig. Could you expand on that a little bit? Where do you think we are in that cycle and if you could also talk into the service provider opportunities as they transition to 600 and 800-gig, as well? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks. I think our differentiations front, I would say, continues to be strong. You look at the standards-based test cases that we offer and you can see that we're leading and that we are staying on the cutting edge and that's what our customers appreciate. So on the edges, we don't see any material change to our competitive position with regard to these advanced technologies and we have continued to invest this year in R&D to keep our differentiation strong. So that's the point I'll make. With regard to how this is all playing out, you might say, if you just think of the smartphone use case, there is about 7,200 band combinations in 5G that have been defined and to-date only 1,500 of them are being tested. So the latest devices that we have account for 1,500. So you start to see that there is considerable runway just in the smartphone use case and with release 16 that is in front of us, there are new expansion opportunities for industrial applications and automotive applications that creates a healthy pipeline for us. With regard to the wireline, the first phase of the 400-gig deployments have largely been in, what I would consider, East-West traffic that flows in a data center and with more to come, as operators start to deploy this technology when the price on the transceivers start to become more affordable. So that's the second wave we expect, but there is continued evolutions of 400-gig and 800-gig that have started, which feeds into our R&D strength.
Tim Long: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon. Congratulations on the solid results. A couple of questions. Just when we think about the year-over-year compares on both revenue and orders to the fiscal first quarter guidance, can you just remind us how much of a headwind Huawei should represent fiscal first quarter to fiscal first quarter? And sticking on the China topic, I'm just curious, when you think about the 5G strength, how important has China been over the last several quarters? More importantly, as you look into the first half of the year, what are you expecting from China? I guess the underlying question is, do you feel as though China will continue to deploy 5G at a relatively healthy clip despite the Huawei ban, or do you think there is some potential for digestion there before re-acceleration?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, this is Neil, why don't I take the first part of that and then maybe we will have Mark comment on China and some of our expectations there. I think the most important comment with regard to Huawei is, the situation with Huawei is not going to change our expectations as it relates to our long-term growth outlooks for our business or for our markets. We're entering the year in a very strong backlog position and I think that strong backlog position is going to enable us to essentially mitigate the impact of any short-term perturbations that may happen on the order line because of the year-over-year Huawei compares. We have an extraordinarily diverse base of customers around the world driving demand in our end markets and we're looking at that and the strengthening we've seen over the past couple of quarters relative to where we were in Q2 and we're going to keep our foot on the gas relative to those long-term targets.
Mark Wallace: Yes, John, this is Mark. I'll follow-up with that. So the business -- our orders in China in Q4 were strong and steady throughout the quarter despite some decline, obviously, impact from Huawei, that came from strengths in 5G and it is extending across the ecosystem as we scale those solutions. As Satish talked about 400-gig is hot, high-speed digital and optical manufacturing. So it's a very broad industry for us. We've also seen the economic recovery in China. They recovered first and more quickly and we've seen that show up in our automotive order growth and general electronics. And the bottom line is, as Neil mentioned, our business in China is -- we have a very broad footprint, the business is strong. We've been successful and we'll continue to be successful to deploy and redeploy our resources to continue to capture growth in 5G and across the other segments.
John Pitzer: Thanks. Very helpful.
Operator: Our next question is from Matt Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Matt Niknam: Thank you for taking the questions. One on margins, you're exiting the year a lot closer -- I think actually exceeding your longer-term target and so maybe, Neil, if you can help us think through why with a seemingly improving -- you've got a big backlog revenue trajectory should improve, the anticipation of margins maybe reverting back lower, how we should think about the different puts and takes? And then just one follow-up on orders. I know normalized order growth was about 1% and you're reaffirming the longer-term top line growth targets of 4% to 6%. Just wondering if you can call out the bigger areas that are still lagging and the path to get back to that longer-term mid-singles growth rate? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so let me start with the margin side of that first. So first of all, we're very pleased with the margin performance of the business in the year and we look at this year and some of the challenges of this year as a great test of the operating model that we've been talking about really since the launch of the company. That being said, our operating margin targets, our margin targets in general, they are annual targets, not quarterly targets. We hit 25% this year and we've talked about getting to 26% or 27% operating margin is the target that we outlined at our Analyst Day and we are still working towards that objective. I think we're highly confident in our ability to achieve that and as we look forward to this year, I think you can look to -- obviously, in the second and third quarters, with revenue down and the corresponding expenses down, but you saw in Q4 the margin performance that we can put up with expenses returning to a more normalized level. With regard to how we get back to mid-single digits, I think we are seeing some relative strengthening across the broader markets and of economies, in general. I think a great indicator of that is what we're seeing in general electronics. We saw a strong return in our education business, which is, as I think, indicative of some recovery from the COVID situation. Even looking at businesses like auto, while auto orders were still down on a year-over-year basis, we saw very strong sequential improvement in auto. So things are getting better and I think we're going to look really across the entire portfolio for strength and just broad macro strengthening to help drive us to those levels.
Matt Niknam: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open.
Chris Snyder: Thank you. You talked about the tough Q1 comp. Can you just maybe tell us what percent of Q1 [ph] orders and revenue came from Huawei just to give us a feel for what the underlying demand is?
Neil Dougherty: We expect it to be about a 5 point headwind in the first half. That's roughly how we're thinking about it, but again, I think, given the backlog situation that we have coming into the year, I think that's going to be the dominant driver of our business and so I think that's going to give us the ability and give us some time to overcome what might be some short-term perturbations on the order line. We're highly confident going into the year.
Chris Snyder: Okay. Appreciate that. And I mean, is it fair to assume that 5% for the first half it's more weighted into fiscal Q1, just given that the China COVID impact hit in the fiscal Q2?
Neil Dougherty: No, that's correct and I said as much in my prepared remarks, we clearly have a tough order comp in Q1, but I'd point you back to the backlog situation. We're guiding strong revenue growth in the first quarter and we're going to be in a good position as we migrate through the year. Certainly our revenue comps in Q2 and Q3 get significantly softer, obviously, but the backlog that we built over the last several quarters is going to provide a buffering for us.
Chris Snyder: Appreciate that. And then just following up on that. Some peers have talked about the ability to sell non-U.S. IP to Huawei. Can you maybe talk about any opportunity here for Keysight and have these restrictions that we've seen led to any upstream share shifts that would maybe allow you to partially offset this headwind as we move into 2021?
Neil Dougherty: Let me take the first part of that and I'll let Satish maybe comment on the second part. We do have some ability to sell some small portions of our portfolio into Huawei going forward that don't include any material U.S. technology, but it is a very small portion of the portfolio. We do not expect Huawei to be a material customer for us going forward.
Satish Dhanasekaran: And just to add to what Neil said, it's too soon to call any share shifts, but we start to see the smartphone -- Tier 2 smartphone makers in China continue to invest in R&D because they see an opportunity. So that's probably one positive offset, if you will. The second one that is evolving is the resurgent interest in Open RAN technology to provide a different alternative to 5G base stations. I think if you look at -- those two things have the potential for us as we look into 2021 and beyond.
Chris Snyder: Thank you for the time. Appreciate it.
Operator: Our next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Yes, hey, good afternoon. Great quarter. I have like 15 questions and I can only ask one.
Ron Nersesian: Make it a good one.
Adam Thalhimer: Let's go with the seasonality for fiscal year 2021, Neil. I think you said less seasonality in 2021. I'm just curious what you meant by that and how you want us to model it?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, we just think -- again, I'm going to bring you back to the backlog situation as we slowly work off the backlog that we built up over the last couple of quarters, we think that is going to essentially mute the impact of what would typically be more demand-driven quarterly seasonality that we've seen in prior years. We expect a much more muted revenue seasonality over the coming quarters, maybe with a slight uptick in Q4, but much more muted revenue seasonality than what is typical.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. Thank you, guys.
Operator: The next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you for taking my question. I'm just wondering what the all-in temporary cost reductions were in fiscal year 2020 that come back in fiscal year 2021? Just trying to get a sense of -- as you referenced in your prepared remarks, some of those variable cost flexing back up?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, I think that the big driver is, obviously, we've talked at length in prior quarters about our variable pay programs and the flexibility of our cost model. That's probably the single biggest driver. Then there are the obvious things that impact many companies, just dramatic reductions in travel, as an example. I would point you to our Q4 expenses. I think we've largely saw our spending return to more normalized levels here in the fourth quarter of the year. Obviously, we'll continue to do administration [ph] and other things, but I think as we look forward, you could look to Q4 as a baseline and then, as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect Q2 to be higher than the other quarters from an OpEx standpoint in FY 2021.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. Thank you very much.
Operator: The next question is from Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, thanks for the question. Neil, could you just give us the backlog number at the end of the year? I mean, at face value, it looks like it's up 22%, but I'm curious maybe was there any de-booking of orders around Huawei or anything on the defense side, or did we enter with that a step-up?
Neil Dougherty: We have not seen any material and any change in de-booking. There is always some noise level of the de-bookings, but that hasn't changed at all. Obviously, we built a significant amount of backlog just looking at the difference between orders and revenue for the year, it's on the order of $300 million, a portion of which you would consider to be abnormal backlog build given the revenue disruptions or the shipment disruptions in the second and third quarter. So it's that abnormal portion of backlog build that we'll be looking to work off over the course of the next several quarters.
Richard Eastman: Okay, and then just a question around Ixia. Can you give us a sense of -- are you seeing any uptick in demand there? Just given the timing and the pacing of demand relative to the new network roll outs and infrastructure roll outs, how does Ixia look here at the end of the year and for the year, and what does the outlook look like from a demand standpoint for 2021?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Rick. So it's been a little over a year since we integrated the Ixia business into the Commercial Communications segment and we've made some excellent progress in realizing synergies with respect to solutions. I would say in the networking space, we see a 400-gig Ethernet. Our portfolio has been significantly strengthened, not only the physical layer, but also in the protocol layer with the addition of the Ixia's Layer 2, Layer 3 business. We're securing some good wins in the industry as the R&D investment flows and with the security piece of the business that we acquired, now we're able to integrate that with our 5G platform and realize greater synergies there as we position solutions for the aerospace and defence industry. So that’s another area where, not only are we addressing traditional opportunities, but also some expansion areas. With 5G now getting deployed, we’re starting to see a pick-up in demand for the visibility part of the business where just this quarter, we had a couple of big opportunities that we closed on with operators looking for enhanced application layer visibility there. So overall I would say, you look at the big trends of virtualization, cloud, and the progression that's going into the application layer, we view the portfolio to be strong and we think the outlook is favorable. Obviously, right now, everybody is recovering from COVID, so that gates that recovery.
Richard Eastman: Okay, thank you. And congrats on a very solid quarter, nice quarter. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Rick, this is Ron. Just one other comment, this is Ron. Just one other comment, we talked about the backlog build in FY 2020. You may want to also go back and look at the backlog build in FY 2019, because it's been a very steady build that we've had for many quarters beyond FY 2020.
Richard Eastman: Okay, I will do that. Thank you.
Operator: Next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. A question on the backlog, I heard you mentioned several times that it's strong and then you just had a clarification that it built in fiscal 2019 as well as fiscal 2020. So the question is, are you at a point where the backlog is now this most recent quarter that you just reported starting to work down or was it still growing and the duration of work down, is it two or three quarters, but you just said in fiscal 2019, it was building also. So I'm just trying to figure out the dynamics of the variable of the backlog?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so obviously, Jim, we've been a growing business here for a number of years and we would expect that our backlog would be growing in absolute terms just given the overall growth of the business. I think if you look at -- what you saw in Q4 was pretty much a reduction in the rate of growth of that backlog. We built very significant backlog in Q2 and Q3, as I previously referenced, abnormal levels of backlog because shipments were depressed because of the factory shutdown and re-ramp in Q3, while our book-to-bill was over 1, it was just a tick over 1, right? So we were more or less in a neutral position in the fourth quarter and so, as I think about going into next year, we have this backlog that is particularly focused on the abnormal amount of backlog build where we've got to get product delivered to customers. And I think on a positive note, really when we were in the process of building that backlog in Q2 and Q3, while orders remained strong because our customers' businesses were disrupted, we weren't in a situation where they were really pounding on the door saying in most cases -- we need immediate delivery of this product, and we really saw that tick up in the fourth quarter, which is what drove the revenues north of $1.2 billion and I think it's that dynamic of our customers now looking to take delivery of that backlog that was built in the Q2, Q3 time frame, that is going to be the predominant driver of revenue for the next couple of quarters.
Jim Suva: And just housekeeping for the stock buyback, is it meant to just keep share count relatively flat and offset dilution, or is it actually meant to bring the share count down?
Neil Dougherty: I'd say a couple of things about that. So first of all, obviously, we've made a commitment to at least at a minimum be anti-dilutive with our buyback programs and we will continue to do that. But just as you saw with us in Q4, and frankly, over the course of FY 2020, we will be opportunistic when those approach. And so, we were very pleased to take 4.3 million shares off the market at an average price somewhere around $96 this year bringing the share count down. And so, when we see those windows, we'll certainly do that, but at a bare minimum, you can count on us to keep the share count constant. We did say in our prepared remarks that we expect in FY 2021 our share count to be 188 million shares, which is flat. So that's our base case we're modeling. When I think about capital -- priorities for capital beyond share repurchase, we continue to have an active M&A funnel development process. We continue to look for ways to put money to work through M&A and assets that are accretive to growth, accretive to gross margin, much like the acquisition that we did of Eggplant at the end of last quarter. So, no real change for our capital allocation priorities at this point in time.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for the details and clarifications and good results. Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from John Marchetti with Stifel. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Thanks very much. I wanted to ask a quick question on the semiconductor business. That's been strong now for a few quarters. So just curious to get your view of where we are in that process no transition cycle? And as we're looking out into 2021, how we should think about that that semi-business performing for years as we’re going into next year?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll make some comments, and maybe Mark can also chime in on the on the forward-looking demand. I would say that we had a very strong year for the semi-business. And it's been driven by the growth in the 5G devices, and the high performance computing needs that have proliferated, especially due to folks working remotely and working from home environment. And we've also captured and capitalized on the China IC spend; our position in that -- in the semi business is highly differentiated, and we continue to track the node sizes from 7 to 5, and now a new activity is starting for 3 nanometers; so we're highly differentiated there. And I'll hand it off to Mark to make some comments on forward-looking demand.
Mark Wallace: Yes. What I would add is that the leading demand that Satish talked about is continuing and the length of the process of retooling the fabs is a very long one; so we're involved in relatively long sales cycles that involve both, the process nodes and new technologies like, with extreme ultraviolet lithography and we see those opportunities continuing to drive into next year. We see continued investments in China, as well as other parts around the world, including the United States with the chips program that was announced several months ago. So the bottom line is, we could see some market constraints coming in in the next couple of quarters, but we see continuing demand for our process solutions to support these next-generation technologies.
John Marchetti: Great. And then maybe, Neil, just a quick follow-up on the gross margin strength here. How much of that I guess is mix-related? Is it a function of that continuing growth in the recurring software piece of the business? As we look out into next year, I guess, what's the right sort of level setting for that, given some of the strengths we seen; even with some of the challenges that you had through, through this fiscal year?
Neil Dougherty: Sorry, let me repeat that, because I realized my mic was off. We continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making on gross margin. And really, there is a lot that goes into that. First of all, I'd start with software content, right. During this year, our software business continued to grow -- outgrow the broader company, until we continue to see nice growth in software and we continue to make great progress in the conversion of the way our customers buy software from us towards more time-based purchasing; so we've actually saw our annualized recurring revenue grow in the high-teens during FY '20, so that's helpful. We're making great progress; I talked about this last quarter in our services margin portfolio, that's a below average gross margin business for us. But on the operating mind, we have our services business now north of 20%, which has been a long-term goal, and a lot of that improvement has come on the gross margin line. And then, I would talk about our migration towards selling complete solutions across the entire portfolio, right. As we migrate to those complete solutions, they tend to be more highly differentiated, and we can monetize that differentiation. And so you couple that with the strength that we're seeing -- the strengthening we're seeing in the markets over the last couple of quarters. I mean, I think we're very pleased with the way orders -- the strength of orders really through the entire cycle of this year. But the strengthening in Q4, the broad indications of macro recovery across large portions of our portfolio, and large geographies around the world is -- as I think very favorable as we look into FY '20 -- excuse me, FY '21.
John Marchetti: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Good afternoon. Neil, just a quick one; you alluded to your CapEx program, I think to monetize some plants. First part, is that growth oriented or cost oriented? And should we expect a similar kind of $1.70 to $1.80 in fiscal '22?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, it's a two-year program. So I'm envisioning, obviously, we're still a year away, but the FY '22 I think will be similar from a CapEx perspective. And we've essentially got some facility up; I would call it just -- kind of resiliency of our supply chain with some facility upgrades we need to do. In other cases, we're looking to get some alternative sourcing sites for some specialized productions for diversification purposes, those types of activities to just make sure that our supply chain is secure.
Brandon Couillard: All right, thanks.
Operator: The next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Mark Delaney: Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Your company mentioned COVID-19 as one of the factors behind the muted seasonality this coming year. Can you elaborate a bit more on that? Now that we've unfortunately seen some increasing cases in many countries, are you seeing any customers around [ph] geographies where there is actually some push out and schedules that have been occurring? Are you more reading this as a potential risk we should be mindful about?
Ron Nersesian: No, I think it's just broad uncertainty, right. Nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, and it's -- the question about seasonality; typically, we see plus or minus a couple of points as we move from quarter to quarter, you can go look at the history and see what that is. And all, I'm -- we're saying two things; one, you've got this -- you know, kind of broad overarching uncertainty around COVID, and then we've got this backlog burn that's going to be happening, and we think those are going to kind of more or less drown out the typical seasonality that we would see in a current year; so we're expecting a much more steady revenue flow over the course of the next several quarters.
Mark Delaney: Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up question on the geopolitical issues that Keysight has been dealing with in the China market. And we discussed Huawei are already on this call, but can you talk about any other customers where perhaps you've been doing business with and there has been some increase in sanctions, even beyond Huawei. I know that it created some potential risk for tech companies, and is there any business you may be doing separate from Huawei that you think could potentially come under additional restriction that we need to be thinking about or maybe already has? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. So I'll let Mark comment on that as well. I mean, I think we were a couple of years now into this -- kind of ongoing, back and forth around trade restrictions. And I will tell you that we've weathered it very well, our business in China continues to do very well. And so whether you're talking about the initial tariffs or companies added to the restricted party list or the situations with ZTE and Huawei; we've been through a lot of these things, and our China business continues to grow. We have a very broad portfolio, we have a very broad customer set, the types of things that Keysight does as a company is very well aligned with what's happening in China. And so, I just think that -- and Mark mentioned it, we've been very good at redirecting our own internal sales and other resources to where the market opportunities are. Mark, I don't know if you have anything that you want to add to that.
Mark Wallace: Yes. So Mark, I would just reiterate that we've already pivoted with the most recent regulations. And as a matter of fact, there were earlier ones back in June that was tied to the military and used customers in China and Russia and Venezuela that we also endured, and we made some changes associated with that. So, we're closely monitoring this thing, we'll continue to be 100% compliant as we always are, and we have built a core capability to pivot quickly and go after the additional business that's available to us. And as Neil just pointed out, for many, many quarters, we've been very successful in doing so.
Mark Delaney: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to you, Jason Kary, for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Hi Chris, thanks for that. And I'd like to just turn it to Ron, for some closing comments.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, everyone for joining us. I -- we are very, very pleased with the results we delivered despite COVID and despite the trade environments; delivering record orders, record revenue record gross margin, record operating margin and record free cash flow. We really believe and see that we have a very strong market position with very differentiated solutions across the ecosystem. And our solutions incorporate world class hardware, very good and strong software analysis capability, as well as services. Our software content continues to increase, our services business is growing, and both of them together are giving us an even stronger business model with more recurring revenue. But our business model is strong, it was tested during the COVID period of time, and you could see the type of results that we can deliver. And last but not least, I really believe we have the best employees in the world that work very hard to bring our customers the best solutions in the world and support them as they try to innovate across their end-markets. And we are committed to create value as we've done in our first six years for our shareholders, and I really believe the best is yet to come. Thank you very much, and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. And you may now disconnect.

===== 2020 Q3  (2020-08-20 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chris, and I'll be your lead operator today.

And now I will turn the call over to Ron.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results, demonstrating the exceptional resilience of our business for the second quarter in a row despite ongoing macro challenges. I am proud of how the Keysight team rapidly adapted to a new operating environment while delivering on our commitments to our customers, partners, and shareholders. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, we delivered stronger-than-expected third quarter results with solid gross margin and record operating margin. Our differentiated solutions drove steady demand through the quarter, and our operational execution was exceptional as we ramped production capacity to nearly 100% by quarter end. Second, despite the ongoing pandemic uncertainty, we remain confident in our differentiated leadership position and the long-term secular growth trends driving our markets. The past two quarters have demonstrated the resilience of the Keysight leadership model, which we believe provides a durable competitive advantage for the long term. And third, despite near-term macro disruption, we expect to achieve year-over-year revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results and the market dynamics within the quarter. Despite the challenging macro-environment, demand for Keysight's differentiated solutions was steady through the quarter. Orders declined 4% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, in line with our typical Q2 to Q3 seasonality. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year while increasing 13% sequentially. The durability of our financial operating model and the flexibility of our cost structure was, again, exceptional as we delivered third quarter gross margin of 64% and record operating margin of 26% and free cash flow of $151 million. In commercial communications, we continue to see the global adoption of Keysight's 5G platform. Our end-to-end solutions for the 5G life cycle across both wired and wireless domain and from R&D and high-value manufacturing are enabling the ecosystem to scale from product development to deployments. 5G commercialization is progressing and on track to add an estimated 190 million subscribers in 2020. Device design and development investments continue to be strong, driven by the large-scale ramps in Asia. As 5G deployment expands and ongoing innovations gain customer interest, we continue to see strength in R&D. With several test house announcements this quarter, Keysight's leadership is further solidified as our 5G test platforms are now being used by all the leading test houses worldwide. Keysight's first-to-market 5G design and test solutions are also helping to accelerate and enable the virtualization of the radio access network and the rapid adoption of the open radio access network technologies. We also saw strong demand for our high-speed digital and optical solutions driven by 400G manufacturing, expansion, and an uptick in R&D investments in 800G. Keysight is well positioned to capitalize on commercial rollouts and mainstream deployments. Our comprehensive platform provides end-to-end solutions that enable customer innovation throughout the entire 5G life cycle. In aerospace, defense, and government, orders were strong in the U.S., offset by lower investment in Europe, and to a lesser extent, in Asia. We continue to see strong demand for our electromagnetic spectrum threat simulation platform as well as solutions for radar, space, satellite, and 5G. In addition, we continue to enable our customers' initiatives to increase their electronic supply chain capacity and reliability in the U.S., which we believe will be a multiyear opportunity. In the automotive sector, macro-driven weakness persists. However, the fundamental drivers for the long-term investment in electric and our autonomous vehicle technologies continue to be a strategic industry priority. As the industry adapts to tremendous change in multiple technology disruptions, Keysight is investing in first-to-market solutions and remains firmly engaged with key market players. We recently announced a multiyear collaboration with IPG Automotive and Nordsys to jointly develop a new modular test platform for autonomous drive emulation. This will accelerate the validation of advanced driver-assisted systems and functions for autonomous driving. Strategic investment in next-generation semiconductor process technology remains a priority for our customers. Demand is being driven by 5G smartphone processors, high-speed networking, and high-performance data center applications to serve the work-from-home economy. This trend resulted in double-digit year-over-year order growth for semiconductor measurement solutions. Software and services, again, delivered solid revenue growth this quarter. Our software-centric solutions strategy is providing strong value to our customers. Services and support, such as KeysightCare, continue to expand to higher value-added consulting and optimization offerings. At greater than 30% of total revenue, our growing mix of software and services is contributing to the durability of our business model while increasing recurring revenue and improving gross margins. With the bulk of our 5G opportunity ahead of us and millimeter-wave commercialization still in its early days, we recently launched a PathWave design 2021 software suite. This advanced software accelerates 5G design, simulation, and verification workflows with an integrated solution that ensures design performance, improves accuracy, and speeds time to market. In the manufacturing arena, Keysight continues to collaborate with leading 5G infrastructure customers, a new cloud-based PathWave manufacturing solutions. We continue to increase our solution differentiation with strategic acquisitions, expanding into the application layer in growing our addressable market. We recently acquired Eggplant, an industry-leading software test automation platform provider. Eggplant's differentiated technology uses artificial intelligence and analytics to automate test creation and test execution. With this acquisition, Keysight is now the only company that can provide test capability from the physical layer through the application layer and extending to the user experience, or UX. Eggplant's customers span a wide range of sectors overlapping Keysight's existing customer base while expanding software test opportunities into new end markets. Looking back at the past two quarters, our performance exemplifies the core values of the Keysight Leadership Model on multiple fronts. We demonstrated operational excellence and the durability of our financial operating model. KLM also expands beyond financial accountability and aligns with our foundational pillars of corporate social responsibility. We released our latest annual CSR report in May. We are proud to have surpassed our social impact goals in community and education while making progress on our governance and environmental goals, including climate change.  Lastly, as a result of recent events, we are taking further actions to expand our inclusion and diversity programs to advance racial equality. For example, we are working with academic institutions, including historically black colleges and universities to reinforce our diversity recruiting strategy. We are committed to accelerating racial equality and will do our part to make a difference. To wrap up my comments, Keysight's execution this quarter is a reflection of our values and our commitment to customers to deliver first-to-market solutions for their businesses and technology challenges. I couldn't be prouder of the Keysight team. They have risen to the occasion in a challenging environment and continue to execute on customer commitments, while at the same time upholding the values that makes Keysight a diverse, inclusive work environment with the culture of innovation, ownership, passion, and respect. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter, thanks to steady demand and strong execution. Despite a challenging economic environment and supply chain disruption, our financial and operational performance demonstrated the durability of our operating model as reported record operating margin and solid cash flow. This performance also proved for the second quarter in a row, the effectiveness of our financial playbook, which is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. For the third quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $1.011 billion, down 7% on a reported and core basis. Our team executed well in ramping production capacity and managing supply chain constraints, which resulted in stronger-than-expected sequential revenue growth of 13%. Orders of $1.067 billion were down 4% on a reported and core basis and were steady through the quarter in aggregate. Regionally, demand accelerated in Asia and began to stabilize in the U.S., while Europe lagged as the pandemic continues to hamper their economic recovery. Turning to our operational results for Q3. We reported gross margin of 64% with improved mix and lower discretionary spending, offsetting the impact of lower revenue. Expenses were well managed as we benefited from our flexible cost structure and the specific actions that we initiated last quarter. The combination of strong gross margin performance and expense discipline resulted in record operating margin of 26%. Net income in the third quarter was $226 million. On a per-share basis, we delivered $1.19 in earnings on weighted average share count for the quarter of 190 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments, we saw continued strength in 5G investments, both in R&D and in manufacturing as well as next-generation semiconductor node technologies, which drove double-digit order growth across both markets, respectively. This strength was offset by weaker spending in legacy communications, automotive, general electronics and international, aerospace defense and government markets. Exceptional execution and expense discipline resulted in CSG operating margin of 26% and EISG operating margin of 27%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents, with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. Our quarter end cash balance reflects the impact of the $319 million net of cash acquisition of Eggplant. We reported cash flow from operations of $183 million and free cash flow of $151 million. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. Turning to our outlook and guidance. As Ron mentioned, we expect to make continued progress in Q4. And as a result, we expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1.170 billion to $1.190 and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.48 based on a weighted average share count of 190 million shares. At the midpoint, this represents 5% year-over-year revenue growth and 9% year-over-year earnings growth. These expectations assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While the near term remains challenging, the long-term secular growth trends in our markets remain intact. We continue to invest in R&D and focus on our long-term strategy of enabling customer success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. As I mentioned last quarter, the durability of our business model, steady cash generation, strong balance sheet and market leadership give us confidence in our long-term core revenue growth target of 4% to 6% and operating margin target of 26% to 27%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neal. Chris, will you give the instructions for the Q&A, please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. 
Samik Chatterjee: If I can just start off with asking for a bit more color about the order trends. Orders did moderate slightly on a sequential basis, and I know you have referred to it as largely seasonal, but maybe if you can share some insights on what you're seeing in terms of order trends outside of the normal seasonality? For example, in commercial communication, how would the order trends for the quarter? And in the markets, end markets that are weak, for example, automotive, what are the magnitude of kind of declines or changes in order trends you're seeing there? And I have a follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: Samik, this is Ron. I'm going to ask Mark Wallace, the Head of Sales, to talk about the order trends first. And then I think Satish can also add some more color commentary towards your commercial communications questions.
Mark Wallace: Okay. Thanks, Ron. Samik, thanks for your question. So orders were very steady throughout the quarter. And actually, in certain areas, they trended to increase as we saw some of the COVID-related impact diminish. But we've seen continued investment in next-generation technologies with strong order growth in 5G. That's already been mentioned. Our high-speed digital and optical solutions to support our 400-gigabit data center expansion, customers around the world has been very strong. And the advanced semiconductor process technologies, including EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet. 5-nanometer continue to be very strong. And with semiconductor, in particular, we saw strength across all of the regions. So the other part that was up was aerospace defense for us in the U.S., and that was offset by some weakness in Europe. Principally due to the COVID effects and some mix conditions in Asia. The COVID impact, I would say, there was some disruption certainly across all regions, but Asia was least affected because they came out first. And on a relative basis, we saw a larger impact across Continental Europe, where many of the countries and economies started slowly restarting and reopening in late May and June. So where do we see this impact? We saw it in general electronics, some of our indirect channels and in areas where government funding was redirected like in education and in research. And then the macro impact from automotive remains soft. But as Ron noted, EV and AV continues to be a very strong top priority for our customers for the industry, and we had several large new customer wins in the quarter. So what I would summarize this as, overall, there were COVID-19 headwinds, but our sales productivity and customer engagement remained very high. We delivered steady and improving orders throughout the quarter. Much of that was delivered by growth and demand from our solutions for 5G, 400-gig, next-generation semi. And we also delivered strong growth for services as customers relied on us to help support their operations and the adoption of KeysightCare continues to grow. And we built a strong funnel along the way as well. So Satish, I'll hand it back to you and you can make some further comments on commercial costs.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think, Mark, you covered it. I'll just maybe say that the strength in our 5G was broad, and we continue to see strong demand for our offerings.
Samik Chatterjee: Okay. If I can just follow-up on question on margins and maybe this is more for Neil. But Neil, in calculating the implied operating margin of somewhere close to 27% in the fourth quarter based on your guidance and when I look at it on a sequential basis I think it's implying more of a 33% incremental margin. So I just wanted to check on that. It does sound a bit low. Particularly, it does imply your ramp up on the OpEx level that I wanted to check if that's really realistic given some of the changes you might have made in the cost structure as well as some of the temporary cost reductions you're benefiting from.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. we typically see some -- even in a normal and -- Sorry about that. My mic is now on, so it's probably easier to hear me. We do typically see even as in a typical year as you migrate from Q3 to Q4, some uptick in expenses, some of that is related to the field as we get to the back half of the year and the push to finish the year strong. The 40% incremental is never intended to be something that is quarter-to-quarter, there are going to be quarters where we're above and quarters where we're below, but we're committed to over the medium to long term achieving that 40% incremental, which is something we've been able to do. So that said, I think we're very well positioned from that perspective.
Operator: And our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard: Maybe Ron or Neil, could you just elaborate on what you saw in China in the quarter in terms of core orders and revenues? And remind us what the total impact of the trade restrictions were in the third quarter, was that about 3% or 4% in total?
Ron Nersesian: Brandon, this is Ron. I'm going to pass this over to Mark, who manages, obviously, China sales, but I think he also can make some comments with regards to Huawei because new news came out this week.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Ron. So, business in China during Q3 was strong. We saw order growth and revenue growth. And much like my comments earlier, we saw a steady flow of business throughout the quarter. Again, strength in 5G with some of the market leaders as well as increasingly selling to this longer tail of customers within the ecosystem, this is where we saw a lot of growth with high-speed digital and optical manufacturing, again, driven by this global demand from our data centers or the data center customers around the world, and China continued to invest in semiconductor capability. We saw some headwinds from COVID, mainly from other parts of the world as opposed to in China directly, some macroeconomic influence from automotive. We did see an impact in Q3 in aerospace and defense. As you may recall, there were some new regulations that were announced in May that were put into place in late June around military end-user customers. So, we saw a small effect because it was later in the quarter. We are starting to see some rebound in some of the markets that were early affected by COVID, like general electronics starting to show some signs of recovery. But outside the quarter, Ron referenced this earlier this week, there was a new regulation for Huawei and a broader entity list that was published. And this was describing some increased restrictions on the sale of products, which are manufactured outside of the U.S., but have U.S.-based technology or software as part of the development. So, this shift to tighter restrictions than the previous regulation will limit sales to Huawei and their affiliates. There were some additional announcements made on some additional affiliates added as well that don't have much of an impact. So I'm going to pass it to Neil to make some more quantitative comments. The one thing I will say, though, is that we faced adversity and challenges in China in the past, and we've been very effective at redirecting our focus and priorities and we're certainly looking at that as we continue to digest the information. So Neil, why don't I pass it to you, you can comment further on the FX.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, I just wanted to give some more specific quantification of the likely impact of this new Huawei news. So we had said previously, based on previous rounds of restrictions to Huawei that we expected Huawei to be a 1% to 2% customer. Year-to-date, they've actually been exceeding that. They're closer to double that rate with increased sales in Q1, which we talked about and then, again, here in the third quarter. As we look forward to next year, it does look like these new restrictions are pretty comprehensive. And so we expect Huawei to be a very small customer for us going forward, but again if you think about it from long term, we were already expecting them to be a 1% to 2% customer. So the headwinds are a little bit bigger next year, potentially up to 4%. But over the long term, it's a pretty minor adjustment from what we've been expecting.
Brandon Couillard: That's very helpful. Just maybe one for Ron on the Eggplant acquisition. It sounds like a pretty interesting asset. Can you sort of speak to the growth rate of the business, some of the primary end markets and the margin profile of the business and whether that acquisition is dilutive to EPS near-term or not?
Ron Nersesian: Sure, Brandon. Eggplant is really an exciting acquisition for us. Again, as we move more and more to software-centric solutions. This fits in right with our strategy. And the way to think about this is a lot of our products or most of our products test hardware or test firmware within our customers' end products. This tests software, so we're finally using software to test software. And in particular, this is used to test user interface development. So when someone's developing new user interface, how do you know that it's effective and it will be something that can get customers through the interface and have a really good user experience. So it's a special unique set of AI that's existed by anybody that creates any type of user experience on the web. The customer base is broad aerospace defense, it's one area where there is a lot of sales, but it even sells, for instance, even into the financial community. It is accretive to us. It's a small acquisition. It is growing and growing roughly double digits. But it has tremendous potential as we marry that in the future with the rest of Keysight and, in particular, with our PathWave architecture.
Operator: Next question is from John Marchetti with Stifel.
John Marchetti: I was wondering if we could just come back to China, maybe a little bit more broadly and not just Huawei, in particular. Neil, I know you gave us some of the numbers there about the headwind that you're expected to face. But you mentioned some of the strength you saw in their efforts to be more semiconductor independent and things like that. How much, I guess, is we're looking a little bit more broadly than just Huawei? Do you see this as a potential headwind as we look out maybe over the next several quarters, if we're going to see some broader entity -- enforcement on this list against U.S. technology?
Mark Wallace: So John, this is Mark. I'll answer part of that question. So first of all, China, as we've said before, is a very -- and you mentioned this, a very broad, diverse business for us because we serve multiple segments. And semi is one of those, right? Now based on the regulations that were just put out, our semiconductor test solutions are not directly affected by the new regulations as these parametric test systems are engineered and manufactured outside the U.S. So what we are watching is a possible impact from reduced capacity demand for chips through the foundries. We're monitoring that situation and looking at the forward-looking path. But again, we expect to see continued investments driven by 5G or the other leading technologies, not only in China, but from around the world to support these next-generation process technologies.
John Marchetti: Got it. And then maybe if when we look out over the next quarter or so, how should we think maybe about some of these geographies. You said you saw some improvements, obviously, post-COVID. As that continues maybe to get a little bit better in Europe and, hopefully, here in North America, do you expect some of the easy order strength or some of the momentum come back into that order line? Just sort of getting back to Samik's question about down again on a year-over-year basis, a little bit worse sequentially. Just trying to get a sense for how you're feeling about the overall order trends of the business.
Mark Wallace: Yes. So if you're referring to semi specifically, there's going to still be market constraints in the coming quarters. The demand will be based somewhat on supply and how much acceleration occurs in the end markets. More broadly, we are seeing improving conditions clearly in North America at the early rebound of some of the business that was impacted by COVID in Europe, in particular. We saw the sequential improvement during Q3, particularly in Europe, and we expect to see that continue in those two geographies. Asia is pretty much through that as we stand now. And then you have some seasonal effects with aerospace defense being large in the U.S. in Q4, and we're expecting to see that surge occur, again, as we get to the end of the government's fiscal year. 
Operator: Next question is from Tim Long with Barclays.
Tim Long: I wanted to ask on the 5G side. Could you talk a little bit about where we are in the transition to the manufacturing side, it sounded like both R&D and manufacturing were strong in the quarter. But could you just touch on kind of where you're starting to see a little bit more traction on the manufacturing side as equipment manufacturers start to ramp up to meet the growing demand and then secondly, if we could just touch on 400-gig and 800-gig. It sounds pretty positive for the traditional wireline and Ixia businesses. Could you just give us a little color on kind of the complexion of that business. How much is data center? How much is telco? How much is in the China end market? That would be great.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks. I think, first, I want to say that from a 5G perspective, the industry continues to progress in a very strong manner. There have been some pushouts in some parts of the world, acceleration in others. Net-net, our long-term view and outlook remains unchanged, and we look at it both from deployments and actually the number of devices that are going to be manufactured this year. So pretty strong from that point of view. And we see that strength reflected in increasing demand for our R&D solutions, but also on a year-over-year basis, we had a very strong uptick for our manufacturing solutions. I think I referenced before, our modular offerings, especially are resonating very well with base station manufacturing and components, and our funnel strength in that area continues to be strong as well. With regard to the 400-gig business, this is the third straight quarter where that business has had strong growth. We've had differentiated offerings. You're right in that a lot of the demand so far has been driven by the web scale companies into data centers, which we think will continue to accelerate and the industry is not done and awaiting. So there's more innovation on the 800-gig that's underway as well and a bulk of this opportunity from a production perspective is playing out in Asia, and we're capturing majority of the share on that front. And we'll continue to see that as the industry progresses to 5G and especially stand-alone use cases, more of the operator-based or metro-based versions of 400-gig play out. So we feel strong about the overall wireline opportunity as well.
Ron Nersesian: I would just add a comment, too. When you look at oscilloscope, which includes sampling scopes that serve this optical market, the results were very strong with double-digit growth in orders. And when we look at that on a competitive basis, we're very happy with our performance and our relative performance.
Operator: Next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna.
Mehdi Hosseini: My first one has to do with your guide. When I look at the past 3 to 4 years, you have done a great job of keeping book-to-bill above 1.0. And if I were to take the midpoint of your revenue guide, it would suggest that booking would have to be up by double digit on a sequential basis and kind of flattish on a year-over-year basis. And I'm not asking for a guide or a booking, but I'm just wondering the funnel of business opportunities that you laid out last earnings conference call seems to me that is beginning to materialize, especially with COVID behind us. And is this the right way to think about it? And anything else you can add to it will be great. And then I have a follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, Mehdi. Yes obviously, we don't guide orders, as you know, and we haven't commented on orders in general. We have built our backlog up over the past quarters. That's good. And given all the supply constraints and things that come in from external to Keysight's manufacturing, we see that backlog position that we have remaining roughly in the same area with some puts and takes as we go forward. And as far as orders, as far as going in that, we're very pleased where we are. Quarter-by-quarter, we'll see how Q4 happens. We clearly were very pleased with our order performance this last quarter and our book-to-bill based on what's going on in the environment. But I'll leave it at that.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. And I wanted to dive into the networking Ixia. It seems to me that based on the peer group, there is acceleration on R&D for 600 and 800-gig and perhaps this could minimize the tailwind of 400. And I'm just wondering if you could comment on it just to remind us how you see your networking split between R&D and production.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I think the way to think about it, Mehdi, is we have a diverse portfolio in commercial communications. And on the wireline side, have a good breadth for solutions, both between R&D and production, and they sort feed each other. We start early with customers and follow that life cycle as they get into production and get back into deployments with operators. So it's that whole, let's say, solution franchise that we have that allows us to maintain a pretty steady business. And on the wireline side, in particular, the business has been a lot more steady and augmented by the addition of the layer two, layer three capabilities from the Ixia acquisition. So yes, right now, data centers is driving 400-gig demand. We expect then the telecom demand to pick up and then simultaneously 800-gig with the first instantiation being 100-gig serial-based will start, and that goes into production. So these waves continue and give us a lot of stability in our commercial communications outlook.
Mehdi Hosseini: But does that include the R&D that is being scaled for the next generation?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Absolutely. Yes.
Operator: Next question is from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: First just something to better understand the growth outlook in the EISG segment and understanding that the comments that the company made in prepared remarks about some weakness that has been seen in the industrial and automotive portions of your business. But when I look at the ISM Index back to year-over-year growth, auto production is ramping back up pretty quickly. The company commented about electric and autonomous vehicle investment continuing. I'm wondering when you think some of those factors may translate into better demand indicators for your EISG segment?
Ron Nersesian: Mark, this is Ron. First of all, congratulations on your new role. And thank you very much for covering Keysight. We're happy to have you with us. With regards to automotive, we're not ready to call a big upturn. We've seen the negative rates of growth in the automotive industry, although the second order -- where the second derivative, I should say, is positive and the growth rate or the decline rate is lessening, we're still not at a point where we believe that, that's translating into more and more cash into the auto industry, which would feed into the R&D funds. So we're going to play it cautiously through this period of time, we are ready, obviously, to capitalize on any new spending that's there. And where you see a lot of the spending in AV and EV, it's really a big strategic priority for us. We have a lot of solutions that are in the market, and we have other ones that we're working on. And over this multiyear scenario, we see tremendous potential for us.
Mark Delaney: And also, thank you for the nice welcome. And for my other question, I do want to understand on EBIT margins, company did a 26% non-GAAP EBIT margin this quarter, which I believe was the target model for 2023. So coming in well ahead of your plan with respect to profitability margins. Maybe you can talk about how sustainable you think this level of EBIT margin may be certainly implied to be at the kind of levels again next quarter. But as you think about between now and 2023, you're already at those levels today? Is this something that you think you can sustain? Or can you even potentially operate above your target margins?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we just put out those long-term target margins of 26% to 27%. And as I said in my prepared comments over the longer term, we are highly confident in our ability to get to and sustain those things. Obviously, we've hit 26% this quarter. These are clearly not normal times nor do we expect next quarter to be normal times. We have a unique operating model that allows us to maintain profitability and cash flow generation in tough economic times. A key portion of that model is the variable pay component for 100% of our employees, the drivers there, organic growth and operating margin. Obviously, the organic growth situation right now, driven by the macroeconomy is allowing us to save significant money on the single biggest component of our cost structure, which is our people. We see other areas so that's a direct result of COVID, spending has decreased significantly, whether that's travel, which is an obvious one, R&D project materials with engineers working from home, those types of things as well as we've taken specific actions around NKWs and -- excuse me, temporary workers and in other areas to really put a clamp on discretionary spending. So again, over the longer term, we're committed to 26% to 27%. We're very pleased with the results we're getting in the short run. As those costs come back as we face some other expenses as we go into '21, one of the things we are watching very carefully is our pension expense. With interest rates being at historically low levels, we're expecting pension expenses to increase next year. So there are going to be some things that in the short run are going to probably push us back a little bit the other direction in turn, but we're well on our way towards a long-term trend of getting to and sustaining those 26% to 27% operating margins.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. As Neil said, there are a lot of things, puts and takes that we're managing, as he said, everything from pension expenses in this low interest rate environment. We had temporary executive salary cuts. The overall comp that we had on a variable pay basis, travel, et cetera. However, it is worthwhile to note from my chair, it's always a balance between long-term profitability and short-term profitability. And as we look at this, as we look at the margins, could we take the margins a little bit higher? Yes. But we're investing to make sure we have a differentiated, competitive advantage versus the competition and can give customer solutions that they want to provide growth. And as we model this all out, we think we're in a very good shape to create the most value for the shareholders, balancing investment with short-term return.
Operator: The next question is from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research.
Jim Suva: I have two questions, and I'll ask them at the same time. So you could kind of answer them at any order you wanted. But regarding the Eggplant acquisition that you just closed, can you talk to us a little bit about the contribution for the revenues that it will be for the quarter outlook you did? I'm trying to look at the organic growth rate. I want to see what's going on there. And does it also impact your order growth rate that you just reported, which I think was down about 4% for this reported quarter? Or is Eggplant not into your orders? Then my second question is, can you help us better understand about the connection between your higher revenues next quarter year-over-year, yet your order rates still being negative year-over-year? Kind of how do you bridge those two fundamental metrics?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Let me take the first question with regard to Eggplant. As you know, or as we've said, it's a relatively small business. But as we report core growth numbers, relative to as reported, we would expect Eggplant to have about a 1-point impact on our growth rates. It's going to add about a point of growth on, either the order or revenue line on a go-forward basis. Obviously, they were only part of Keysight for a portion of the third quarter. But on a go-forward basis, that puts it into an order of magnitude. With regard to Q4 and kind of the revenue being sequentially up, but orders continuing to be down on a year-over-year basis, obviously, we are in a strong backlog position. We've been building capacity over the course of the last 3 months and are now in a position where we can ship essentially at a level that was on par with where we were before coming into COVID, and so that's driving revenue As Mark said, the macroeconomy is still highly uncertain. We're seeing areas of relative strength and areas of relative weakness, but the COVID situation is impacting more or less every business in the industry equally, and we remain confident in our competitive position and the strength of our technology and over the long-term in the secular growth trends that are driving our end markets.
Operator: Next question is from Rick Eastman with Baird.
Rick Eastman: A tremendous quarter. Just a question around the book-to-bill here in the quarter. Obviously, the math is at 1.05 for Keysight in the quarter. Could you just give us a sense, was the book-to-bill greater than 1 in EISG and A&D?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, we're not reporting orders at the segment level. You have the information for Keysight, and we're just not going into that level of granularity.
Rick Eastman: Okay. Well, let me ask another question. When you look at EISG orders, and potentially, aerospace and defense and you just look at the absolute dollar amount of the orders, is there a general sense that we're stabilizing at this lower level? I mean, we assume the book-to-bill of one. Is there some stabilization in the overall EISG business? And the same question around aerospace defense.
Neil Dougherty: Let me take the EISG portion, and then I'll let Satish address the CSG and specifically the aerospace defense question. EISG, we've talked about the various segments within EISG. And we clearly have an auto industry that is going through some pretty difficult times and our business selling directly into auto was similarly impacted, right? And so you're seeing, I'd say, a more severe macro impact or an above-average negative macro impact in the auto industry. At the flip side, you've got the semi industry, within EISG, which is doing very well right now as folks are investing in process technology, you have 5G and other things that are driving semiconductor demand. And so not just us, but across the semi industry, you're seeing relative strength even in a time of broad macro weakness. And then the third piece being general electronics is the one that's kind of most macro-tied, and we've often talked about that being as our most GDP-linked business. And so there, I think you're going to see the performance of our general electronics business largely mirror what happens with the broader economy as we recover from COVID. So Satish, do you want to comment on aerospace defense?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Sure. So obviously, I think you see the revenue line was down for the aerospace and defense business. But when you look at the orders, this was the second highest Q3 in the last five years. So the business is actually holding up very well with strength in the U.S. And our own position with respect to electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and space and satellite is strong. And when you couple that with the prime contractor backlog that has continued to increase through the year, it also sort of portends a strong indicator for future orders as well.
Rick Eastman: Okay. And then if I could just sneak in one more thing. Satish, lots of puts and takes around adoption curves for sub-6 and for millimeter wave. I'm curious if there is a measurable impact on either orders or demand as Open RAN seems to be maybe gaining some traction. And again, I don't know what the Keysight's content would be into those development efforts, but is that having any kind of measurable impact on demand, whether it be orders or revenue?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, first of all, I want to say our 5G platform continues to do well across the ecosystem and on a whole range of applications, so we call it the end-to-end platform, both wireless and wireline, as Ron has mentioned before. I would say the next sort of demand driver in the business continues to be the adoption of the stand-alone version of 5G, along with millimeter wave, and then we just had to release 16 version of standard that just got passed in July. So we have some strong drivers going for the business. When you then compound it with this macro situation that's going on with security concerns around for base stations clearly Open RAN or virtualized RAN has got a lot of interest. And the fact that we have the total technology stack, including Ixia's core network test capabilities that we're now able to purpose to address this opportunity. In fact, this quarter, we just launched our Open RAN toolkit to enable developers there. While there isn't a big player yet that's emerging in Open RAN, there's a lot of customers. It's broader market space that's emerging with different test needs and interoperability needs. We're participating in the O RAN standards, and we're already starting to book some orders as well.
Operator: Next question is from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson, Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Curious for your revenue outlook for Q4, do you see revenue up in both segments? Or is the growth really driven by communications?
Neil Dougherty: Are you talking sequentially or year-over-year?
Adam Thalhimer: Year-over-year.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We don't guide at the segment level. So I don't think that's information we want to share at this point in time.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I was hoping maybe you could give some high-level '21 thoughts, just given that two quarters of low single-digit order declines, how that might juxtapose against your thoughts on '21 growth?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. For '21, it's difficult to call even three months out. Obviously, we've got a lot of factors that are at play, including what's the pace of the COVID recovery, what happens with the U.S. elections and those types of things. Again, I think as we look over the longer term, we continue to be encouraged by our relative position in the marketplace. We recognize that those macro factors are going to more or less impact everybody equally. And so not only our market position, but the strength of our portfolio and our technology is going to enable us to weather everything better than most. And so we're very encouraged by that. I did touch on some of the specific headwinds that we're going to be facing going into FY '21, specifically about Huawei. But other than that, we've got a great operating model. I think that's driving strong profitability and cash flow today, and that will continue to do so no matter how the macroeconomy develops over the course of the next several quarters.
Operator: Next question is from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America.
David Ridley-Lane: So I wanted to ask how much of the backlog that you built in second quarter, so you had about a $200 million build, were you able to ship in the third quarter?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. As you can see, we built backlog here again in the third quarter. So we did not see a backlog reduction. I guess the way I would answer that is we're working very closely with our customers to meet their most urgent delivery needs. And to this point, we are not aware of a single instance where we have lost an order because of inability to ship. So we continue to -- we revamp production consistently throughout the year. We're very close to 100% capacity across all of our internal manufacturing. We do see some supply chain constraints regard -- with some of our suppliers, but we're very actively managing those. And as Ron said, as we look forward, we expect our backlog position to be similar to where it is today.
Ron Nersesian: And tactically, I think it's probably pretty obvious. A lot of the orders that we received that went into backlog in Q2 were shipped in Q3. However, the orders that came in Q3, in particular, typically, the orders that come in towards the end of Q3 go into the backlog. So although you don't see a backlog change in Q3 or you see one of your roughly $50 million, it doesn't mean we ship those orders and didn't get to Q3. It's always two rolling accounts, and we're always shipping first based on customer requirement. And typically, the customer requirements that we receive from the Q2 orders are things that are needed by our customers before the Q3 orders. So it's rolling. We are clearing out, obviously, what we received in Q2. And then in Q3, we build up again and it sort of works that way through the quarter, depending on the seasonality month-to-month.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And as you sit here in August, do you think it would -- there's a six month time frame for kind of getting back to, if you will, sort of a normal backlog age, i.e., shipping all the things on a normal schedule, if you will?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We're back to, as I said, close to 100% capacity at this point in time and very successfully managing other supply chain constraints. So I think we are right now shipping for an overall schedule and able to meet the demand requirements of our customers.
David Ridley-Lane: Got it. And just one last one, if I could. Was there anything unusual in terms of the mix of revenues that was either a benefit or a drag on gross margins?
Neil Dougherty: The only thing I would say is that, obviously, we had a very strong -- semi business continues to be very strong at this point in time, and that tends to be above-average from a gross margin perspective. And then we continue to see great performance in our software business, adding recurring revenue. Software and services in combination, as we mentioned, north of 30% of our total revenue, and so that is also additive to gross margins.  And even if you look at services, specifically, it is a below-average gross margin business, but we have, over the course of the last -- services used to be a separately reported segment for us. Over the course of the last 18 months, we've continued to make great progress on services profitability. So we've talked over the long term about getting services profitability up north of 20%, and we now achieve that objective for our services. So it's come a long way as well. It's not as dilutive as it used to be.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, the services business, which has been part of our growth strategies. That was one of our key elements, continues to grow. Orders and revenue grew double digits. And that is a chain that keeps going. And that helps our ARR. There's no doubt about that. And it has increased our margins. And as Neil mentioned, it's above 20%. And also, software typically grows faster than the rest of our business, and that helps our gross margin. But we produced a real solid 64% gross margin this quarter, and there's nothing really unusual with regard to what we delivered relative to our strategy.
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Well, thank you, Chris, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with many of you at the upcoming virtual conferences. And with that, I wish you to have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason and thank you all for joining us. First and foremost, we hope that you're all staying safe and well and our thoughts are with everyone affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The world has faced unprecedented challenges over the past several months and I would like to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication and commitment to Keysight, our customers, and our partners. Our execution and results this quarter underscore the power of our balance sheet, business model, and our Keysight leadership model, which drives our unique high performance culture and guides our company to continuously delivering greater value to customers, shareholders, and employees. I'll focus my formal comments today on three key headlines for the quarter. First, the health and safety of our employees is our top priority. After acting quickly to temporarily close most of our global locations in mid-March and implementing risk mitigation measures in response to the pandemic, we are now re-opening sites and our production capacity is ramping rapidly. Second, despite the mandatory government shutdown of our production facilities and resulting supply disruption impact on our Q2 revenue, Keysight delivered steady orders, strong operating margin, and record free cash flow. Our results demonstrated the exceptional resilience of our business and the durability of our financial operating model. And third, despite the near-term uncertainty, we are confident in our differentiated market leadership position, the strength of our operating model, and the long-term secular growth trends across our diverse set of end markets. Turning to the dynamics that impacted second quarter results. Demand was steady across markets in February. As the impact of the pandemic expanded beyond China in early March, we responded quickly to limit the spread of the coronavirus and mitigate the risk to employees, customers, and suppliers while also responding to local government directives. On March 18th, we issued a press release to announce the temporary closure of most locations around the world, including our production and order fulfillment facilities, which were fully closed for two weeks in March and had limited activity in April. We also took the necessary steps to deliver on our customer commitments, particularly those that provide essential services and support the communities in which we operate around the world. Working with local governments and health officials to implement health and safety measures at all of our locations, we are pleased to announce that we are re-opening sites worldwide. Despite ongoing broader industry supply chain challenges, we are ramping our Keysight production and services operation and expect to be back to 100% capacity by the end of the third quarter. Now let's take a deeper look into our financial results. Order growth was positive through March, followed by a decline in April to finish the quarter down only 3% compared to last year's record second quarter. While we don't typically comment on calendar quarter performance, given the dynamic nature of the situation, it's worth noting that Keysight's orders and revenues both grew mid-single digits in the January through March time frame. Despite lower than expected revenue as a result of supply chain disruptions, the resilience of Keysight's business model was exceptional and our flexible cost structure performed as expected. As a result of our immediate actions to reduce costs and preserve liquidity, we delivered operating margin of 19%, record free cash flow of $275 million, and a record cash balance of $1.8 billion. Our second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year as both segments of the business were impacted by the limited manufacturing capacity. However, we continue to see steady demand across several end markets with ongoing investment in next generation technologies such as 5G, 400 gig, and advanced semiconductor node processes. Other markets such as general electronics and automotive are expected to be more challenged in the near-term. In Commercial Communications, our ongoing 5G order momentum resulted in a new record. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to gain strong global customer adoption and is enabling the commercial 5G launches underway. We are further solidifying our global leadership position across both the wireless and wired 5G ecosystem through close collaborations with market leadership and standards and first-to-market 5G design and test solutions. This quarter, we introduced Keysight's new 5G core network test solution called LoadCore. The 5G core testing software simulates complex real-world subscriber models. This enables mobile operators and network equipment manufacturers to qualify performance and reliability of voice and data transferred over 5G networks. This solution leverages from the Ixia and PRISMA acquisitions to deliver testing capability needed by our customers. We also announced a collaboration with Rakuten, an operator in Japan, to enable their 5G deployments using our solutions for test, validation, and optimization of devices and networks. Keysight's comprehensive solutions portfolio spanning the entire ecosystem is a key differentiator in the market. In aerospace, defense and government, order growth was driven by strong demand in the U.S. which was partially offset by lower international investment. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space, and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. Despite the substantial challenges in the automotive sector, next generation electric and autonomous vehicle technology is a strategic priority for our customers. Keysight continues to invest to be first-to-market with solutions and remains highly engaged with key market players. For example, we recently announced the use of our Scienlab battery test solution in the BMW Group's new Battery Cell Competence Center in Germany. Foundry customers are continuing to prioritize investment in advanced process node technologies and incremental infrastructure. This resulted in revenue growth for our semiconductor measurement solutions where we had less supply chain disruption. Software and services continue to contribute to the differentiation of our solutions and recurring revenue base. While growing above the company average over time, they are strengthening the durability and diversity of our business model. In Q2, the combination of both software and services represented approximately 35% of revenue. Turning back to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we are committed to supporting our customers and our communities through this challenge. For our customers, we launched an Innovate Anywhere Program to enable IT teams to support remote users ensuring VPN performance and security. We also implemented various health and safety measures at our facilities to ensure all safeguards are met before production and other operations resumes. For our communities, we are contributing to the relief efforts globally through monetary and supply donations. These include donations of personal protective equipment to local hospitals and government agencies providing support to children, families, and the most vulnerable. We are also making direct financial contributions to local communities and global non-profit organizations. Before turning the call over to Neil, I'll close with a few key points. Keysight is a market leader in large, diverse, and growing end markets and serves a diversified global base of over 32,000 customers across multiple industries. The challenges of this pandemic are unprecedented and I'm proud on how our team has responded. Our execution demonstrates the durability of our business and the resilience of our business model with 19% operating margin and solid cash flow even with a Q2 revenue impact. We continue our significant investment in R&D and remain focused on first-to-market solutions. Our sales teams remain highly engaged with our customers and we continue to execute our strategy for long-term above market growth. While we expect ongoing COVID-19 demand and supply chain headwinds over the next few quarters, our long-term secular market growth trends and the strength of our operating model remain intact. We expect to come through this challenge stronger than ever. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and the outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron and hello everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless specifically noted otherwise. Keysight delivered a solid quarter thanks to strong execution in a challenging environment. While supply chain disruptions dampened our revenue performance during the second half of the quarter, our results demonstrated the resiliency of our operating model and durable cash generation. We responded quickly with proactive measures to reduce costs and preserve liquidity while supporting our customers and advancing key projects. For the second quarter of 2020, we delivered revenue of $895 million, down 18% on a reported and core basis due to our site closures and supply chain disruptions that started in mid-March and continued through the end of the quarter. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 3% on a reported and core basis. As Ron mentioned, we continued to see steady demand in investment across multiple end markets, particularly for our next generation communication solutions. Turning to our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 63% with improved mix and lower spending partially offsetting the impact of lower revenue. The flexibility of our cost structure resulted in lower variable compensation and a reduction in outsourced manufacturing costs. This combined with other specific actions such as a temporary hiring freeze and reductions in discretionary spending enabled our flexible operating model to perform as expected resulting in 19% operating margin for the quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $148 million. On a per share basis, we delivered $0.78 in earnings. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 189 million shares. Regarding the performance of our segments. In light of the broad supply chain disruptions, CSG and EISG expense management and margin performance were exceptional. CSG operating margin was 18% while EISG delivered 24% operating margin. On the demand side, general electronics, education, and automotive were weak while investment continued in 5G, aerospace defense, and other leading-edge technology solutions. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with a record $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $450 million of additional liquidity available under our undrawn revolving credit facility. We reported cash flow from operations of $298 million and record free cash flow of $275 million or 31% of revenue. The strength of our cash generation reflects the power of our financial operating model, which incorporates a flexible cost structure and includes a financial playbook that is designed to preserve margins and cash generation during challenging times. Under our share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 1.3 million shares on the open market in the first half of the quarter at an average price of $91.14 for a total consideration of $120 million. Our year-to-date repurchases are sufficient to achieve our objective of being anti-dilutive for the full year and to exit the year at 190 million shares. While we are focused on optimizing liquidity, given our strong operating model and cash generation, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. While we are not quite back to full capacity, our production operations and those of our suppliers have been ramping since mid-April. We expect to make continued progress in Q3 and as a result, expect third quarter revenue, operating margin, and earnings to be in line with or better than Q2. These expectations are based on our order funnel, a strong backlog position, and assume limited incremental supply chain constraints or disruption from additional shutdowns or a second wave of the pandemic. While maintaining R&D investments for future growth, we will continue to focus on profitability and leverage the flexibility of our operating model to manage expenses. In closing, the near-term situation is obviously challenging, but we remain focused on our long-term strategy of enabling our customers' success through first-to-market leading-edge solutions. Once the COVID-19 situation stabilizes, the durability of our business model, cash generation, strong balance sheet, and market leadership position give us confidence in our long-term financial targets that we shared with you at our Investor Day in early March, specifically sustainable long-term core growth of 4% to 6%, operating margin of 26% to 27%, and EPS growth of at least 10% over the long-term. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Robert, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: I want to go back to your reported backlog. Despite the shortfall in revenues, you were still able to grow backlog by double-digit and given your assumption for booking for the current July quarter, do you expect a resumption of year-over-year growth in quarterly revenue by the October quarter and I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, this is Ron. Our backlog - our book-to-bill was 1.22 for the quarter showing very strong backlog build and obviously, our profitability - our operating model was strong and held up at 19%. If we had shipped that, we clearly would have been in very strong shape with operating margin in the mid-20s. As far as the quarter going forward, we have seen our operations turn on. Our main international operations that we have in Penang, Malaysia is back to 100% capacity. The main operations that we have in the U.S. are at about 70% capacity and will be at 100% by the end of the quarter. So even though there is a short-term disruption to the end of - to the second half of Q2 and the first half of Q3, we expect Q3 revenue to be at about the same level. We don't guide for orders for the future quarter though.
Mehdi Hosseini: Perhaps maybe I could rephrase the question a different way. I'm assuming that the strength in your communication group is driven by orders for millimeter wave on R&D and also you highlighted 400 gig networking. As R&D activity on the millimeter wave picks up, is there any synergy between that and the networking that would enable you with a bigger size of the customer wallet. In other words the stack approach that you have focused on, would that finally become material so that you could capture a bigger part of the customer and is that what's going to be driving the momentum with booking for some of the growth areas.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, we had a strong quarter in 5G. We had a very strong quarter in 400 gig back into the network and our overall play of winning up and down the ecosystem does create that synergy. I'm going to let Satish talk a little bit about the details.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, thanks, Ron. Mehdi, you're correct in that communications especially these new areas such as 5G with millimeter wave adoption and 400 gig and such are really gaining increased importance in today's world given what we have seen in terms of a disruption. So that should start to manifest itself. In fact, with discussions with customers we're having today, the focus is on accelerating innovation and going faster. So that positions us well having the entire layer one to layer seven capabilities internal to the company and having built that platform I referenced at the Investor Day gives us an advantage to go faster and deploy solutions with customers. You will also notice that we have a number of industry-leading collaborations that we announced just this quarter with the likes of Qualcomm, Rakuten, China Unicom, SONiC and others that spans the wireless to wireline arenas and positions us well for the future.
Mehdi Hosseini: So, does that mean that the synergies are beginning to materialize?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I think so and you'll start to see them accelerate as we launch more solutions. We have some 90 new solutions planned for the second half of the year, which we're investing for and that should continue to position us very well in the communication space.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Tim Long: I just wanted to ask about the China market. Could you talk a little bit about the trends there. Obviously, the timing for manufacturing and businesses opening was a little bit different and obviously some more political talk there. So can you just give us an update how China was and how you're viewing that - the next few quarters and then I had a follow-up?
Mark Wallace: So, Tim, this is Mark, Mark Wallace. I'll take that question talking about China. So the main headline from Q2 is that our business remained steady. We had a stronger February than we expected coming out of the Lunar New Year that as you recall was extended by an extra week and we saw strength continuing in 5G and commercial comms as Satish had talked about both at the physical layer and across the protocol stack, 400 gigabit R&D and optical manufacturing continued to ramp as we saw global demand come from the carriers and the data centers. Automotive was down and we saw some mixed conditions in general electronics and education as we made comments in the opening remarks. And China, you know, continues to accelerate investments in semiconductor capability particularly around next generation semiconductor technology and as you alluded to, there is a continuing set of evolving U.S. regulations. We're paying very close attention to these. At this point, there might be some indirect impact to some of the foundry business, we're not really able to quantify that just yet. We have assessed the overall situation in terms of the most recent [USDOC] restrictions and regulations and we believe it represents something on the order of 1 points to 2 points of headwind going forward, but you know as we did with the August 2018 RPL additions, we will redirect sales resources to go after new opportunities to drive growth elsewhere and all of these restrictions go across all of our technology companies that supply into China and not just Keysight. So the bottom line I would say with China is our customer engagements remained high during the quarter as we adapted to the new remote environment that we're now leveraging across other geographies and our business in China remained steady despite all of these challenges and headwinds.
Tim Long: And then just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned 35% of revenues coming from software and service in the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about the ramp there and do you think - are you hearing from customers with the kind of global disruption like this that there might be more of an accelerated move to those type of models. Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Yes, Tim, this is Mark again. I'll take that. Regarding software and services, as you point out, we saw revenue growth in the quarter faster than the rest of Keysight as has been the case for many quarters. Revenue for software was roughly flat, services was up slightly on a core basis. We had a record high Q2 for our design software orders, which indicates the continued demand from customers who continued to work remotely during the global pandemic and as Ron mentioned in his opening comments, we introduced the Innovate Anywhere initiative, which was very successful really enabling thousands of software engineers to work from home. And moving forward, we see this program feeding into the superior software and services growth that we've been delivering for a long time. Our customers and their engineering workflow has changed and we expect to see customers continuing to work in this mixed lab and work from home environment and I think our software and services provides us another way to support their engineering teams in either case to maintain engineering productivity. So yes, we do see our software strength continuing to be a factor, especially in the new go-forward environment that we're experiencing.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti with Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Ron, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the demand side as you've gone through these last couple of months. You mentioned obviously that January through March, both orders and revenue were growing in the mid-single digits, but I'm just curious with orders down 3% year-over-year for the quarter, did you have customer behavior change dramatically in that month of April as well that coincided with your ability to ship. How has this sort of disrupted your customer landscape not just your own supply-side issues?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. Obviously, we had a drop off in April when everything pretty much shut down. So our order level was lower. Our sales organization worked from home and actually has been very effective after the first couple of weeks just trying to figure out how to contact customers. A matter of fact, they've been finding it pretty efficient to be able to get on with Zoom as long as they have an established relationship with those customers, but that's what we saw with regards to the seasonality in the quarter. Revenue, we've talked about that and how that is ramping now and we'll be back to full strength by the end of the quarter. Mark, would you like to add anything?
Mark Wallace: Yes, what I would add is we did see customers working hard from home. They were actually more accessible than they normally would be because we knew where to find them. So we engaged with them. We continue to book business and we continue to build our funnel for Q3 and beyond. It's at the highest level really it's ever been looking out three months, but there was some pull back in certain areas. As an example, some of our general electronics business is tied to new engineers being hired, right? And obviously, that wasn't going on. Some of the government-funded activities such as research obviously, our education business based on the universities being closed were affected and we saw that effect happen more towards the end of the quarter. So there's some dynamics from the industry that really played into that timing as well.
John Marchetti: And then maybe just as a follow-up to that, was there a big difference that you saw, geographically. Obviously, we all know that China has kind of come back from this a little bit more quickly than some other areas just given that that's where everything started, but as you look out across North America and Europe, have there been, I guess, big regional differences as you've seen those demand trends play out?
Mark Wallace: Yes, John, what I would say is, there was some regional differences mainly from kind of the distribution of different segments and different customer behaviors. As an example, we already talked about the fact that we saw strong order growth in the U.S. from aerospace defense that continued throughout the quarter from both the direct government and the prime contractors whereas in Europe, the strength was really more around semiconductor solutions tied to advanced technologies like EUV, which is extreme ultraviolet lithography and some next generation processes and then we saw some growth in commercial comms in Europe tied to some new 5G design wins and - so it varied. What I would say is most regions saw the impact when it came to kind of the general electronics and automotive segments. So there is some variety from region to region based on different industry dynamics in each of the regions.
Ron Nersesian: John, it is interesting to note though that a lot of our major customers has said they're not slipping schedules and they're doing everything they can to either stay on track or make up for any type of shortfall what they have and that bodes well for some type of let's say accelerated purchasing at some point when they do need it.
John Marchetti: So as we get back to a more normal environment, you would expect that you'll be able to at least sort of make up some of the shortfall here in this fiscal 2Q and 3Q.
Ron Nersesian: Yes and clearly with the backlog, you could see, we've built $200 million worth of backlog in the last quarter. There is no doubt that we will be able to clear that out at some point in the future. We've guided or given you a range for Q3 where we expect to be, but beyond that, we expect ourselves to be at 100% and we'll be ramping rapidly from there.
Mark Wallace: You know, Ron, the only other add I had for John just real quick, we look at cancellations, we didn't see any increase in cancellations. We look at, is there any kind of push outs to Ron's point about projects staying on track, we really didn't see a lot of push outs either. So we've built a strong funnel and I think we're going to be in a good position when the economy begins to recover.
Ron Nersesian: And the good news is the global race continues to be ahead in 5G, which nobody wants to take a pause.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Ron, you talked about record 5G bookings in the quarter, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of the composition of those orders between R&D test and production test and if you can kind of speak to the individual customer groups like the chip guys and the base station customers, the mobile smartphone customers, that would be helpful. And then I've got a quick follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, Toshiya, I'll let Satish, who is right in the middle of it, give you more of the details.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, Toshi, it's a very strong order quarter for 5G. Our orders grew at record levels as we mentioned before in Ron's comments, but equally worth noting was the strength continued into April and the growth that we saw was broad. It was across all regions grew and all segments of the customer base grew, all the ones that you referenced, chipsets, devices, and the NEMs and even the operator segments. I would say if we fill back the types of applications, the sustained investments in R&D, manufacturing started to ramp. In fact, we had a good uptick for our modular offerings, which we're enabling some of the component manufacturers to ramp up. So that was a positive note for us. And then we also saw success in new verticals such as automotive with the C-V2X application that we just launched and with our Aerospace and Defense solution with some of the 5G security offerings we have launched. So in summary, some of the opportunity progression that I had outlined at Investor Day sort of started to play out in Q2 and we also added 40 new customers for our 5G platform through our marketing efforts and working with our sales teams globally. I also want to say that our customer engagement through this phase has been very strong, even though some of our customers are working from home, they have been continually engaged as Ron mentioned to make sure that their projects don't slip too much and in some cases where they are slipping, they're looking at ways to accelerate. I also want to highlight some of our, let's say, remote working with customers is working very well. In fact, our 5G virtual events have been well attended by over 8,000 customers. So that points to the strength of our solutions there.
Toshiya Hari: And then as a quick follow-up, you spoke about some of the near-term headwinds related to automotive, general electronics, education, and government. I'm curious what percentage of your overall business to those end markets collectively account for and is it fair to say fundamentals, whether it be bookings or revenue troughed in the April quarter or could there be continued weakness into July and as a follow-up to that, if you can kind of speak to your exposure to Huawei and the foundries in semiconductor business, that would be very helpful. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, we haven't sized those specific markets Toshiya but the GE and automotive markets are a significant portion, more than half of EISG obviously the part that's missing there is the semi business which has been strong, but EISG's business is kind of more heavily or more - the weaker market areas are more heavily weighted towards EISG with general electronics, automotive, EISG, these things that tend to be more tightly linked to GDP.
Mark Wallace: The auto business in particular has slowed down, we obviously saw significant slowdowns as everybody has seen in the industries for the old technologies or old auto. Some of the new auto wasn't as strong as it was pre-COVID, but we still feel very good about our position. So we are there for when that market snaps back.
Neil Dougherty: And then to your second part of your question as it relates to Huawei. We don't really have any change at this point as it relates to our expectations of Huawei going forward. We kind of still we expect them to be a 1% to 2% customer for us on a go-forward basis.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Ron, I was just wondering if you could help us understand what you think the supply impact was for COVID in the quarter and I guess in your prepared comments, you said it was both a production and an order fulfillment hit. So I'd be kind of curious as to how much revenue and orders do you think you lost in the quarter from the supply side of COVID?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, I mean it's impossible for us to know what would have happened right, but I think if you go back to where we were at the beginning of the quarter, we obviously put a guide out for the quarter that we had a high degree of confidence in our ability to hit. And so you could look at that delta relative to our guidance on the revenue line and for all intents and purposes, I would attribute that shortfall to COVID. I think from our perspective, the world changed in mid-March. As we talked about the sites being closed, limited productivity in April, but we continue to be very optimistic about how we're positioned on a go-forward basis. We're a leader in our markets, we have a strong technology position and I think as markets recover, we are going to come through this even stronger.
John Pitzer: I'm sorry, go ahead.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, I think it is fair to say taking a look at our order rate and knowing how we do our supply chain planning, a book to bill of around 1 was probably would have been normal if there wasn't a COVID issue for Q2.
John Pitzer: That's helpful. And then, guys, I know you're not giving official guidance for the July quarter, but I'm just kind of curious from a production perspective, if you look at the April quarter, relative to 100% where were you for the blended average of the quarter and as you look into July, I know there's a lot of moving parts, but how do you think sort of relative to 100% your production levels looked in July versus April?
Ron Nersesian: Well, you could go back and look at history of where we've been operating somewhere around the $1.1 billion per quarter kind of range as close to full production. So that gives you an idea of something to key off of. Obviously, the dynamic is a little bit different, right? We were going full steam ahead through mid-March and then it shut off pretty quickly with the ramp in April. We're now continuing to ramp in May, expecting to be back to something close to 100% across the ecosystem by the end of the quarter. So you kind of have to ramp down last quarter followed by the ramp-up this quarter and as close as we can call it, at this point, the revenue numbers and the profitability numbers are going to be in the same vicinity as one another.
Neil Dougherty: So if you look at that, you could see where we were down roughly a couple of hundred million dollars, we're down at roughly 80% of capacity. So the fact that we took out - we lost a couple of weeks in March and then you could take another week or two out of April, just as you start to see that ramp or ramp linearly. So that's a very rough estimate, but I think it's pretty accurate.
John Pitzer: And Ron, if I could just sneak one last one in, just given your production issues, can you talk a little bit about your share position and is there any concern that competitors might be able to take this opportunity to steal some share on the margin?
Ron Nersesian: I don't think so. There could have been - there can be some very minor issues, but if I take a look at orders and I look at orders January, February and March, we grew mid-single digits on the order line, which is pretty competitive. Nobody else or very few people have reported in our industry what happened in April. So when they come out, I'd be surprised if their numbers were not the same. We've been growing above market every single quarter now for years and for everything that was going on, I do anticipate that we are at market or better and our backlog position now is so strong, you'll see that flow into revenue and profitability and cash flow as we go forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: I wanted to try to understand the margin disparity in Q2 just because the EISG margins held up so much better and is that a trend you expect to continue?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. So, I mean if you look across our business, right, the one area where we saw actual revenue growth was in semi, which is all within EISG and it's also a very high margin segment for us. So I think predominantly looking at a mix issue or not issue, a mix benefit that EISG received with the very strong semi shipments relative to the other parts of their business and so that's really what you see going on there. And it's worthwhile to note that obviously with a lot of fixed infrastructure as we start to see the business come back, you'll continue to see very strong gross margin performance.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay and then so high level, it sounds like you're kind of girding for a more protracted downturn in EISG, but at communications, it sounds like when the COVID situation allows, you'll kind of quickly turn back to revenue growth, is that fair?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, I think EISG has businesses that are more GDP linked. We've talked about general electronics, which includes the education segment, but if we just talk about education for a while, until - there's really two aspects of education, there's the teaching aspect and the research aspect, but in both cases, you need students on campus, right, to really get those education markets up and going. Automotive, we know what's happening in the auto industry. So we still don't know what the shape of the recovery is going to look like. You can read all the same reports that I read about what the ultimate recovery is looking like, but EISG I think tends to be more macro linked and more linked to GDP where the drivers within CSG the roll out of 5G, the roll out of 400 gigabit, the aerospace defense investments potentially have the ability to buck some of those trends as folks work to get those technologies to market.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: I have two questions. I'll ask them both at the same time so you can answer them in any order and they are pretty straightforward. The first is with coronavirus, is the R&D cycle still lengthening or are people now adjusted to work from home and work remotely now where it's actually compressing. The reason why I ask is it seems like two months ago, was everything progressing slower and it now sounds like from your comments and other companies comments, things are kind of coming back. So I was just kind of wondering about the design cycle and then my second question is your inventory went up quite a bit, but you talked about supply chain issues. Was that simply not having all the right parts to put together your heavy equipment and your big calibration items in your test and measurement things or did some of your inventory like trapped in certain locations or you're missing just a couple of widgets that go into it and so you're like 98% of the box completed before it can ship. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, Jim, this is Ron. I'll just take the questions. I'll take them in reverse order. With regards to the inventory situation, it's real simple. We have parts coming in the door and we have no one in the factory to build them and that's the case that we had in the second half of March. It's not the case now as we have Penang up and running, but we also supply parts from our tech center in the United States. So when there is nobody putting together parts or even if things are put together and they're not shipped, there is no revenue credit. So all parts have to be there in order to complete a product. There are thousands of parts in certain products, some made within Keysight and more of the commodity type pieces that are put into products in addition to our unique differentiators. Some of them flow in and some flow out, but the bottom line was we weren't putting together any systems or shipping them out and that was because of not only internal to the Keysight manufacturing facilities, but also the contract manufacturers that would do sub-assemblies, but now we're very happy with the progress that has been made and where we are now and where we expect to be by the end of this quarter. The second issue with regard to the R&D cycle, there was a bit of a stop but everyone's trying to figure out how to operate in this new normal where every customer that we spoke to are very, very high percentage of them went through that. Now they've situated to work at home, to go in part time, to use test systems or in some cases, like China, return back to work. So we see the R&D engineers being much more efficient and accordingly, they're trying to figure out how to keep their projects on track because they are competing against their ultimate competition. So that's why we see things accelerating in that cycle. How much equipment acceleration we'll see at what rate is yet to be seen, but we feel very positive as we look forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Just a few questions, two questions, one just kind of targeted at aerospace defense, and just a couple of thoughts here. What was the order growth in A&D year-over-year? And then secondly was the - with A&D, was the business in the revenue there disproportionately impacted by the plant shutdowns, because it wasn't a very tough comp and I'm just curious with the revenue down 25%, if there was a disproportionate impact there?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, so I'll take that. From the order perspective, orders were basically stable versus last year. With regard to the revenue impact, some of that stuff, particularly for the U.S. markets require to be built in the U.S. We did get earlier access to our Penang facilities than we did to some of our locations in the U.S. and so there probably was - I think it is fair to say that there was a disproportionate impact on aerospace defense from a manufacturing perspective just given the fact that the access to the U.S. facilities lagged the access to our facilities in Asia in April.
Richard Eastman: And then just a follow-up question around the backlog. One would expect perhaps that given access just globally is better to customers as hopefully they - everybody starts to return to work here and we got some of the access kinks maybe worked out a little bit in the fiscal second quarter, but typically, your orders are flat to a bit softer in the third quarter relative to the second, but again with improvements around access, would you expect to build backlog again in the third quarter given where you are and the disconnect between the production ramp and kind of what's going on the order and sales side?
Ron Nersesian: We don't guide orders out for Q3. Rick, I think as you know, but we're going to try to do everything we can to lower our backlog. I'm not saying that we've guided that but what we're trying to do is improve our position to get our deliveries out to the customers that need them. You're right on a typical non-COVID environment, we see a ramp at the end of Q2 and then the biggest ramp at the end of Q4, which is literally how we do the comp in the field organization and then Q3 is not as high as you would expect when looking at Q2, but overall, we expect orders to be very solid and not out of line with what we've seen in the past.
Mark Wallace: Yes, I mean obviously the COVID situation is going to supersede the normal seasonality of the business. From a Q2 perspective, we had the first half of the quarter, which was, I don't want to say unimpacted, but through the first half of our quarter, this was essentially still viewed as largely a China problem, it didn't go global until mid-March in the second part of the quarter. I think the macro side of things is where it is now, we don't know where it's headed, but - so I think you're going to see a different seasonality than is as typical and then I like Ron's way of characterizing it, I mean, I think we've guided revenue in Q3 in line with Q2. We're certainly pushing on the manufacturing side as hard as we can push it, but right now, the way we see it and way we see the ramp progressing, you're going to be looking at revenues that are more or less in line.
Ron Nersesian: And the reason why you see that isn't so much the internal capacity, you could do the math and say for 100% right now internationally in Penang and we're at 70% in the U.S. and you do some type of linear extrapolation of basically the facility that we have in our fab in the U.S., you could come up with a much higher number. But in order to produce products, you need three things, you need all the parts, you need your contract manufacturers for sub-assemblies and you need the Keysight manufacturing facilities. The CMs are very close to 100%, you see our facilities getting close to 100%, but we still are relying on the delivery of components from different suppliers that go into our products and that is something that is a bit extended that is figured into our guide.
Richard Eastman: And can I just putting that all together just tying it together. Neil, if we're looking at a similar cadence of revenues, monthly through the fiscal third quarter, we've got the issues that you've spoken to around production, production ramp overhead. Is there any reason to assume the decremental for the third quarter won't be similar to the second quarter given the flexibility in the model?
Neil Dougherty: I expect it to be similar.
Richard Eastman: I got you. Thanks for the short answer to a long question. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: So, China's stimulus package included $30 billion or so earmarked for data centers and in the U.S. and Europe, the work-from-home trend has shown some of the weaknesses that are out there in corporate data centers and networks. How do you think about Keysight and their ability to benefit on a relative basis from those trends?
Ron Nersesian: Satish owns the data center portion and I'll let him answer.
Satish Dhanasekaran: We think with the upgrades to data center technology and in lieu of what people have learned from working at home and at this scale is definitely going to be a positive driver for us, especially for our Ixia business with multiple implications, speed is one of them, security is one of them, and visibility being the other piece to it. Right now, we did have a bit strong double-digit quarter for 400 gig based on some ramps we're seeing in China and our outlook for that part of the business continues to be favorable.
David Ridley-Lane: And then a question, could you maybe quantify the cost savings actions that you took and if there are - some that are structural in nature could you may be call that out. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, we're very pleased with the way our operating model has performed. We've talked a lot about what we felt we could do in a down cycle. The business there - the model has a number of structural elements that are designed to respond instantaneously to changes in condition. The number one of those is the variable pay component. Again 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with our business results. Outside of the executives, the rank and file, if you will, that's really tied to our growth rates and to our operating margins and so as both of those things corrected in the third quarter, we saw a significant reduction in our people-related costs. Similarly, contract manufacturing, outsource sales, those types of things, those came online. Beyond that we took action to reduce discretionary spend, everything from - again, certain things happened relatively automatically like travel basically crashed towards zero in the second half of the quarter, reductions in temporary workers, the executives who have actually put in a pay cuts for our executive team ranging from 100% at the CEO level to 50% for the senior vice presidents. So we've taken a number of different actions to further reduce spending.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, just a quick one for you, now that you're back to the net cash position, I'm curious what you might be seeing in terms of the M&A funnel and if the dislocation in the market has perhaps created some incremental opportunities for you to take a look out here.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, well, Brandon, we have the same priorities that we had before obviously to fund organic growth to make sure that we stay neutral or anti-dilutive and to look at M&A opportunities. In certain cases, things have become more attractive, but we still have a high hurdle to beat our cost of capital with our - excuse me, to beat our WACC with our ROIC and we continue to look pretty aggressively at those but again, we will make sure that the ROIC is high enough.
Brandon Couillard: A quick one for Neil just on the CapEx line for the year, you still thinking about $120 million for the year, is that still a firm number or would you expect some of those projects to maybe get pushed out on…
Neil Dougherty: Yes, no, we'll probably push out a little bit, obviously we made significant capital commitments already for the year, but we will - we would expect to under spend. We're probably now - we're looking at something more like a $100 million to $110 million for the year.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Samik Chatterjee: I just wanted to start off with more a question on the manufacturing footprint here. I mean, we've seen a lot of companies face supply chain headwinds this quarter, but your magnitude of the shortfall has been obviously larger given your kind of concentration in the U.S. and Malaysia. Just wanted to get your thoughts about whether you're thinking any differently about the long-term plan related to the manufacturing footprint, anything to mitigate that risk. Obviously, I understand its once in a lifetime thing, but how are you thinking about it in the long-term about where you want to be?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, to have a global pandemic come and literally be ordered out of our own factories is something that we don't think is typical and I don't know if it's once in a lifetime, but it's a very rare occasion. We also have a lot of our manufacturing capacity that are spread around with CMs and the CMs are located in different countries where they can move, they can move their production from one facility to another and move it around into different countries. So we look at that, we review that annually and make sure that we have an optimized footprint trying to balance what we typically would see and what type of benefit there is financially versus spreading out over multiple factories. So we continue to do that analysis. We have the discussions all the time and there are some things that we do, do, that were not always public.
Samik Chatterjee: Just a follow-up and I know you've commented quite a bit on the call here about how kind of the strength in the order trends you're seeing. Just wanted to kind of see if you can help us to match that up relative to kind of how you expect some of the customers that you are interacting with to respond if the macro remains quite weak going into the second half. Obviously the order trends here are strong, but the expectation I think remains from the customers that macro will hold up quite well. What do you think in terms of where do you expect to see some incremental weakness or which customers or projects do you expect to be more fungible relative to if we have a weaker macro in the back half of the year? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: I think the country by country race to lead in 5G will continue regardless of the macro situation. There is too much at stake for a lot of our large customers and you know them from the NEMs right through the whole ecosystem in communications and they will continue to drive towards getting to market first. When you look at the GDP plus or the GDP or GDP plus businesses, such as general electronics and the general manufacturing, there you could see a slow down as we've seen, for instance, in automotive. So I think those are the businesses that will continue to see some weaknesses which are automotive and general electronics, but I do expect the communications business where there is a race for that to be robust going forward and as you know, that's the strongest part of the business and that enabled us to produce 19% operating margin.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd now like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Robert and thanks everyone for joining us today. We look forward to hopefully speaking with many of you at the upcoming virtual conferences that we mentioned and wish you all a good day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, the diversity of our end markets, as well as the robustness of our business model. I will now focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, Keysight delivered a strong start to the year demonstrating sustained profitable growth across multiple dimensions of our business, both revenue and earnings exceeded the high end of our guidance and we achieved record first quarter orders, revenue and earnings, including an all-time record of gross margin of 65%. Second, our ongoing strength in 5G-related investments and Keysight's leading solutions across the ecosystem resulted in record 5G orders and continued growth in Commercial Communications. In addition, secular growth trends are fueling broad-based momentum across our target markets. And third, we are monitoring the coronavirus situation and want to acknowledge those who have been affected. While we do see some potential for near-term impact, we remain confident in the strength of our broad portfolio of industry-focused solutions, software and services. Now, let's take a deeper look into our first quarter. We achieved $1.26 in earnings per share, which was $0.16 above the high end of our guidance and represents 36% year-over-year earnings growth. We achieved record first quarter orders that grew 12% year-over-year, reflecting the resilience of our business and extensive market reach. Revenue grew 9% year-over-year to reach a new first quarter record. First quarter revenue performance was driven by strength in Commercial Communications, Aerospace, Defense and Government, and Semiconductor Measurement Solutions. In commercial communications, record first quarter revenue was driven by continued investments in 5G, fueled by the transformation of communications systems, including wireless access, infrastructure, wireline technologies, data center and the cloud. Our success is being driven by close collaboration with key market players to innovate and create many industry firsts. For example, we recently introduced the Value Series Channel Emulation Solution called PROPSIM FS16. This solution was enabled by the Anite acquisition and is the latest in a long line of our innovative first-to-market solutions to accelerate 5G development and commercialization. We’re also excited to announce today another industry-first solution that enables customers to model 5G security threats in the lab. 5G technology innovation is enabling a massive proliferation of connected devices resulted in greater security, vulnerabilities, and an expanded attack surface. Keysight's 5G security testbed was made possible by the cybersecurity expertise and technology gained through the Ixia acquisition. Recall, that as of the first quarter, we integrated the Ixia Solutions Group, ISG, into our Communication Solutions Group to accelerate solution synergies and the teams are already getting very good traction. For the second consecutive quarter, orders for Ixia Solutions grew double-digits as we saw continued strength in network visibility and 400-gigabit Ethernet investment in Layer 2/3 protocol solutions. Ixia and our other commercial communications acquisitions such as Anite, AT4 and PRISMA enable us to provide our customers with a broad and differentiated set of solutions that span the stack layers as 5G evolves over the years to come. We are pleased with the broad global adoption of our 5G platform as our R&D solutions continue to lead the industry.  For example, we recently announced that Keysight's 5G conformance test solutions have been selected by the Korea testing laboratory for global 5G device certification. We are also seeing success beyond R&D with key wins this quarter in component manufacturing for base stations and devices as 5G production begins to ramp globally. Moving on to other growth factors, our strong performance beyond commercial communications reinforces our broad momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. In Aerospace Defense and Government, our revenue grew double digits to achieve a first quarter record with broad base strength across all regions. This was the third consecutive quarter of strong year-over-year order growth in Aerospace Defense. Our solutions for electromagnetic spectrum operations, radar, space and satellite continue to benefit from a favorable U.S. spending environment and ongoing investments in technology modernization. In automotive and energy, revenue grew high single digits with increasing customer demand for key strategic applications. Our success in automotive is being driven by our first-to-market solutions and focus on next-generation technologies. For example, this quarter we achieved 3GPP validation of the industry's first C-V2X or cellular vehicle-to-everything radio frequency conformance test case. As a result, Keysight is enabling the automotive industry to accelerate commercialization of connected cars and autonomous vehicles. We also announced a collaboration with a leading provider of battery cells on cell formation. This collaboration supports the electrification of vehicles by enabling the development and manufacture of advanced battery cells. In Semiconductor Measurement Solutions, we achieved strong order and revenue growth driven by our customer strategic investments in next-generation process readiness. Our software and services continue to play an increasingly important role in Keysight's differentiated portfolio of customer-centric solutions. Software orders once again grew above our overall growth rate. Notably, this quarter, Keysight was named the organizational winner of the 2020 Business Intelligence Group Award for our PathWave Test 2020 software released just last October. PathWave Test 2020 was selected from a range of recent innovations submitted by organizations around the globe. I'm also happy to report that services orders and revenue grew double-digits in the quarter. We continue to see good adoption of our new support offerings such as Keysight Care, which was also a contributor to our year-over-year gross margin expansion. In summary, we delivered another outstanding quarter and a strong start to the year. Differentiated solutions across diverse end markets, consistent execution, and strong financial performance continue to drive our value creation. We have an exciting lineup for you at our Investor Day next week on March 3 and we look forward to sharing an update on our strategy and our long-term expectations to the business. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. We delivered another strong quarter as we continue to capitalize on the broad-based momentum across Keysight's diverse end markets. For the first quarter of 2020, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.095 billion, which was well above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% on a core basis. Better than expected revenue results were driven by broad strength across multiple end markets. Orders outpaced revenue for the sixth consecutive quarter as Q1 orders of $1.141 billion grew 12% in total and 11% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 65% and our operating expenses of $433 million, resulting in our fourth consecutive quarter with operating margin at or above 25%. We also achieved net income of $240 million and delivered $1.26 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Now, moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $818 million, up 9% while delivering record gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 25%. In Q1, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $573 million, driven by strength in 5G solutions.  As Ron mentioned earlier, starting in the first quarter, we have aligned the former Ixia Solutions Group or ISG with our commercial communications end market and are now reporting Ixia results within our Communications Solutions Group. Aerospace Defense and Government generated revenue of $245 million, an increase of 10% and a first quarter record driven by a broad-based growth across all regions as investment in advanced technology continued. Order growth for this end market was high-single digits and we have a strong funnel going into Q2. EISG generated first quarter revenue of $277 million, up 8% driven by strength in semiconductor measurement and next-gen automotive solutions. EISG reported gross margin of 61% and operating margin of 26%. Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow, we enter our first quarter with $1.69 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $197 million and free cash flow of $165 million or 15% of revenue. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 730,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $102.48 for a total consideration of $75 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2020 revenue to be in the range of $1.138 billion to $1.178 billion. For the first half of 2020, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 7% revenue growth or 6% core growth. This guidance incorporates our current assessment of the coronavirus impact. Given the dynamics of the situation, we expect any impact from coronavirus to simply be a push-out in demand and do not anticipate any impact on our full-year results at this time. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.28 to $1.38 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. The midpoint of this guidance reflects approximately 20% earnings growth for the first half of 2020. As Ron mentioned, we look forward to sharing our strategy to drive profitable growth, as well as our latest long-term expectations for the business at our upcoming Investor Day on March 3. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Josh, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, Ron and Neil. Congratulations on the solid results. Neil, I know you said in your prepared comments that the guidance for the fiscal second quarter includes your view of the coronavirus impact. I'm just wondering if you can quantify it for us a little bit – for us? Did it bring down the midpoint? Did it widen the range? And I guess, how are you thinking about kind of your exposure? Is it mainly a function of what you're shipping into China or if you can just walk through the methodology that would be helpful.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Hi, John. This is Ron. I'm going to give you a little bit of a long answer on this because I figure there's a lot of interest in the effects of the coronavirus. First of all, it's a very unfortunate situation affecting not only China, but we're seeing it obviously in South Korea, Italy, and other countries, including customers around the world. The situation is changing, so here is an up-to-the-minute update, as far as what we know at this point. The first thing I'd like to say is that we have a lot of sales in China, but we do not do much manufacturing at all. Over 99% of our products are not manufactured in China. We do receive about 10% of our parts or a little bit less than 10% of our parts from China, but all of this is built into what our guide is. So, let's talk about our employees. We have 991 people in China and another about 233 non-Keysight workers that help us in sales, support, and research and development. Of those 1,224 workers, luckily none have reported coronavirus cases at all. The other thing that's worthwhile to note is, if you look at Hubei province in Wuhan, they're not a big employment center for us. We have folks in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu in Szechwan Province and Shenzhen primarily, as well as some salespeople that are scattered throughout the rest of China. One third of those people are back at work already as we've opened up offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Shenzhen and the rest, the other 770 folks are working remotely through video conferences, remote support with remote control of instruments and giving daily reports to the sales management. So, we get a daily report on the health status of every one, the sales funnel and how everybody is doing in order to make sure we're taking care of our customers, as well as our employees. We're working through that same process in other parts of the field or in other regions, but clearly the impact in other regions is smaller and not as big of a center for us. So, let's talk about the business implications as we know it. Last quarter, we guided [$1.055 billion] in revenue and we delivered [$1.141 billion] in orders or we delivered $86 million in orders above what we said assuming a book to bill of 1%. Of that $86 million in orders, we shipped $40 million of it. So we actually delivered revenue of $1.095 billion, not $1.055 billion, but the additional $46 million we have in backlog that can help smooth out any timing delays that we would see from the coronavirus. We have guided $1.158 billion, plus or minus $20 million, and we've built in approximately $20 million worth of impact into our guide. The key point though that you should remember is that we have a good backlog situation. We have very differentiated products, and we're very confident at this point that we'll be able to make up any delays that we see in the second half of the year, therefore not affecting Keysight's performance in fiscal year 2020. I hope that helps, John.
John Pitzer: Very thorough – very thorough and helpful, Ron. I guess, as my follow up, second consecutive strong quarter for Ixia. It's a relatively new business within your portfolio. For us in the investment community, we haven't had a lot of experience with the Ixia asset. I'm just kind of curious as to how you would characterize sustainability of the growth you're seeing now. Is this in your mind a naturally lumpy business or do you feel like Ixia has kind of turned the corner and there's sustainability to these [terms].
Ron Nersesian: There's two main parts of the Ixia – what was the Ixia business, which is now our network assurance solutions, one of them is network test and then the other section is network visibility. Network visibility is a consistent grower. It was smaller, but it continues to get larger and larger, and we're very happy with that. And there we see a little bit more of a linear growth. The network test business isn't as linear; it depends on basically the build-outs that happen in our end customers. I'll turn it over to Satish to maybe add a couple of more comments, but that's the high level summary.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks Ron. I'll just say that the improved performance is a function of a few factors. First, it's improving market dynamics associated with the broader adoption of 400-gig Ethernet, technologies from data centers, and then solid execution both on the business and the sales side through the changes that we have just instituted.  The differentiated products and solutions that are coming out are gaining good traction with customers. On the visibility side, as Ron mentioned with network packet brokers and taps and on the test side with our [Layer 2/3 business], which is a big part of that portfolio which had a record quarter through the broad adoption of the 400-gig technologies. Looking ahead, we're really focused on accelerating synergies inside the group. As we've talked about, 5G is a big trend that impacts both wireless and wire line technologies and that convergence is really a sweet spot that we're targeting. We have started some new solution offerings in the space, for example, with the combination of RAM and co-testing, we are very uniquely positioned there. And second, we've recently launched the security testbed for 5G that does reference to Ron's transcript, which is really a combination of Ixia security toolkit and applied to the 5G technologies, which is gaining a lot of interest from customers. So, in summary, improving market dynamics, solid execution combined with this synergy utilization should position us well in this business. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: The other thing I would like to say is that obviously with the second quarter of double-digit growth, we're very happy with the way this business is progressing. At first, we had to do a lot more integration work than we thought. We had to move the supply chain to ours to get basically the improvements and the synergies that we expected on the cost side and we had to enhance the quality. So that took a little bit more time than we had expected originally. However, the business and the business dynamics and where it's going in the synergies that we have really makes us excited about this business' contribution to Keysight in the long-term and our ability to provide complete workflow solutions from one end to the other.
John Pitzer: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, Europe – and the European region kind of grew 2%, slowest on a two-year stack in about a year. Can you sort of give us sort of macro picture maybe what you've seen in terms of the sub-segments in that region?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. I'm going to turn it over to Mark. Our order growth was higher than the 2% than we reported, and revenue was roughly 5% growth. So, that's a little bit of a different picture, but Mark, the Head of Sales, will take you further.
Mark Wallace: Right. So, Brandon, we have seen gradually improving business conditions across Europe. And as Ron said, revenue up 4%, 5% on orders, and we're seeing some of that come from the commercial comps side of our business. Automotive, especially advanced automotive solutions and next-generation auto and semiconductor continue to show signs of recovery. Aerospace Defense is mixed, the situation in Russia remains slow and there are some delays to some of those orders. On the other side, general electronics is an area that we put a lot of focus on not only in Europe but around the world, both from our broad portfolio of customers, as well as our education customers and we continue to see growth there as well. And then finally, the automotive business, particularly around electric vehicle, continues to expand with new customers and a strong funnel of new opportunities going forward. Some of these customers are more traditional automotive mechanical type of customers that are now moving into the electronics domain, and we are very well-positioned to support them with our solutions from Scienlab, as well as our broader offering of services. So, we're seeing improving conditions as compared to kind of the middle of last year and we hope to see that continue going forward.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. And a follow-up for Neil, 65% gross margin in the first quarter is a step up from the kind of where you exited the year last year; can you sort of speak to the room to continue to push that higher and perhaps help us bridge the year-over-year gross margin expansion in terms of the factors and drivers behind that? Thanks.
Mark Wallace: I think we have multiple levers that are helping us on the gross margin line. First of all, I pointed the overall strategy to migrate towards first-to-market solutions to that first-to-market nature, as well as just the nature of providing complete solutions as opposed to tools leads to higher differentiation in the marketplace of the solutions and to have higher software content.  So, mix is helping us not only in terms of the mix of software, but the continued mix shift toward winning in R&D tends to be a higher gross margin sale as well. And notably, this quarter, we actually saw a pretty strong improvement in our services gross margins that it's a smaller business. It does have below-average gross margin in total, but we saw nice improvement in our services business. I think you see the migration toward Keysight Care, which is our new pay-for support or offering is being – is additive there as well.
Brandon Couillard: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti from Stifel. Your line is open.
Ron Nersesian: Hi, John.
John Marchetti: Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask, Ron, you talked about obviously the 5G strength globally. And just curious if you can characterize that, is there still a fair number of new customers that you're winning in that business? Is it the strengthening or reordering by existing customers? Just curious as you're looking at that business continuing to sort of gain momentum, how we should think about the customer profile within it?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Satish will take you through that, but I'm really pleased with the breadth of our overall customer base as it starts to go from Tier 1 to other players. And he'll talk about that.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks, Ron. Very pleased with the results on 5G. I would say a new record as we indicated and growth across all regions and representing customers across this diverse set of ecosystems. The collaborations that we have sustained through years of work with them continue to be very strong and a foundation for the business, but we're also adding new customers as 5G scale. So this quarter, we added 40-plus new customers into our 5G platform, which has been a source of strength. One particular driver that I like to maybe point out that is – that'll play out to this year and the remaining part of this year is the adoption of number of devices that are being announced for 5G. Over 200 devices have been announced to-date. That is up 100% since August of 2019 when we last spoke about this. So that is a big driver for the ecosystem and that will continue to place as well. And finally, from an application point of view, we continue to be strong in R&D where our differentiation is increasing through the test coverage and the new features we're landing, but we're also starting to pick up wins in manufacturing as we have stated we're following our customers' lifecycle. And we've had some pretty decent wins in manufacturing for components in base stations this quarter as well.
John Marchetti: And maybe as a follow-up to that, I mean, historically you guys have talked about wanting to make sure you're really in cast where there's a high cost of failure. And as you're looking at some of the production opportunities within 5G, does that still fit that category? Is it that this is such a complicated technology for OEMs and operators to roll out that that cost of failure is still higher? Is it a little bit of a change in strategy to try to broaden out the reach within 5G? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: There is plenty of manufacturing opportunities for us in 5G. There is no doubt that our R&D presence has grown and has grown dramatically, and that really plays well to our business model, but there are a high value-add opportunities for us in manufacturing. Whether you see that with components or subassemblies, or you look at it down even on the wired part of 5G, you can't just put in wireless 5G and not be able to handle the data on the wired side. So when you look at everything from fiber optic tools and going all the way through the network, there is more and more opportunities for us especially you'll see that on the physical layer, on the physical layer back in the network. On top of that, as everything moves to millimeter-wave, it gets more complex, more difficult to do, and that's where we've been playing for many, many decades and it's relatively new to most of our competitors. So that provides us an opportunity not only to focus on areas where the cost of failure is high, but really we focus on where we can add value-add in total and generate great margins for us.
John Marchetti: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Ron, a couple of quarters ago, you tried to take some of the revenue opportunity associated with Huawei, and there was like a 200 basis point to 500 basis point of the first half of the revenue target that was taken off to de-risk from Huawei, especially with the tariffs. And now we have the coronavirus, but what I want to learn is, assuming that this is more of push out, what happens when like 6, 9, 12 months from now coronavirus is over and hopefully the tariff is over. Can you help us understand what happens to these opportunities – revenue opportunities that are pushed out? And I have a follow up.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I'll start and I'm going to let Neil go ahead and quantify the Huawei situation, but I'll just say this, the Huawei customers really like our products and solutions and they come to us and there's a good demand for those products. As we look further in the year, we have a modest amount in our forecast, but for the long-term they're looking to lead in many markets and we have the differentiated tools to help them out.
Neil Dougherty: I think that's right. I think the same is largely to a broader coronavirus, as I said in my comments, we believe that any disruption that we may see in the short-term that results from coronavirus would simply be a push-out in demand. We don't believe it has an ultimate impact on the absolute level of demand in this fiscal year. I think if you look at Huawei more specifically, we saw broad strength within the quarter. We are limited in terms of what we can sell to Huawei, we're complying with the Department of Commerce regulations, but even with that limited portfolio, our sales to Huawei in the first quarter were a bit ahead of where we expected them to be. I think as we look forward, however we're pretty comfortable with the estimate that we provided of thinking of Huawei as a 1% to 2% customer as we move forward from here.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. And then, I know you're going to dive into this next week, but as we think about your incremental booking, how much of this is driven by your ability to offer full of stack? Are you actually seeing any traction there? Is there any incremental business you're capturing by offering full stack or is that more of a longer-term target?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. No – this is Satish here, and I'll just maybe offer a follow-through. Yes, I think the ability to serve the entire ecosystem is a huge differentiator for us. It separates us from any product-oriented competition that may come up with products. I'd give you an example. In many cases, we're working with operators. We just announced recently that we released 600 test scripts for the four U.S. operator test plans for 5G.  So, someone that wants to service these operators in that ecosystem now have a fastest way of ramping up and getting their time-to-market. So, that's an example of sort of the advantage you get when you are working with somebody that has the end-to-end portfolio. Our ability to reconfigure and create solutions with the broad capabilities we have is another advantage. I'll just give you an example again with the five-year security testbed. A number of our Aerospace and Defense customers wanted to prototype this threat environment in the lab. We were the ones that were able to provide them the solutions. So, hopefully, those help.
Mehdi Hosseini: Your revenue from Europe was up double-digit on a sequential basis. Was that driven by OEM customers, OEM incumbent companies, or is that more of a broad base?
Neil Dougherty: We don't look at Europe or many other regions on a sequential basis because there is such seasonality built into our customer base, as well as into even our sales force and the commissions and how that works out. So, we look at it on a year-over-year compare and that's why we've taken it modestly to 5% order growth and 2% revenue growth for the quarter.
Mark Wallace: Yes. And this is Mark. I would just add again like I said before, we did see some softness in certain end markets last year particularly automotive. There was some mixed conditions in Aerospace and Defense and we're starting to see some moderating trends in that respect. We're starting to see some improvements in semiconductor. We're seeing our broad-based customers and the solutions we're providing to them, shows some signs of improvement as well. So, it's trending in a more positive direction.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Good afternoon. I wanted to get a little bit more color on what – helping to drive the aerospace defense revenue and order growth and was that you – did you see any potentially budget flush at the end of the year or do you feel like this is pretty good underlying payment as well?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, hi. This is Satish. I will take it. On the Aerospace and Defense front, record orders this quarter, building on the $1 billion record finish we had last year. So, very pleased with the results so far. The budget stability in the U.S. is a big contribution factor. There is a lot of program wins that are being awarded by DoD, that’s flowing through to the prime contractors in the supply chain. Our differentiated capability combined with decades of providing solutions to the space position us well. In particular, our Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations Solutions, Space and Satellite solutions are receiving good growth for us in that region. We also see a broader – internationally, a broader wave of defense modernization where people are re-tooling and upgrading their capabilities, and that position us well for the long run.
David Ridley-Lane: And then a different topic, the sales force expansion, can you maybe talk about how the recent hires are ramping up in productivity and just sort of your early results on those hirers, potentially biased you towards increasing your sales headcounts even further? Thank you.
Mark Wallace: Sure. This is Mark; I'll make a comment on that. So, we are on track in making really good progress with doubling the number of frontline sellers across key site and next week, at the Investor Day conference, I will be outlining a tremendous amount of detail on where we stand and what our next steps are. What I can tell you is we are hiring across all regions, we're focused on where the growth is. So, we're concentrating our hires to where we see the best opportunities, and we're equipping our teams with the right tools and training. So not only are we seeing an increase in capacity in terms of just the number of frontline sellers we've deployed, but their productivity is also improving as well. So, again, stay tuned for more. I'll go through a lot more in detail next week.
David Ridley-Lane: Okay. I look forward to. Thank you very much.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Adam Thalhimer: I wanted to ask first about Millimeter Wave, your thoughts on Millimeter Wave in general and how it's performing in the field?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, it's still very early days for millimeter wave deployments at scale. I would say that, you know a large part of the deployment so far subscale 6-gigahertz and still even there, there's a lot of challenges that our customers face, which is why our tools continue to be embraced and are helping with scaling up the ecosystem. The other factor I would mention here is this sort of heterogeneous spectrum environment both with new frequency bands and the higher frequency bands getting integrated is creating sort of this cycle of demand for our tools in this marketplace. So, very early days overall with millimeter-wave, and but there is no doubt that millimeter-wave will be realized just because of all the spectrum that's being put in place and the high innovation that currently the ecosystem is undergoing. Eventually there will be millimeter-wave based offerings with [time].
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And I wanted to ask about cash flow and balance sheet. Your net debt is now, I think, tied for the lowest since the IPO. What are your thoughts on cash deployment? And on M&A, is there any big out there you could do or do you think it's more about continued tuck-ins?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I don't think you see any – we don't expect to have any significant changes to our capital allocation priorities. We're looking to strike balance with what we'll do, we continue to invest, to drive organic growth in the investments we're making in R&D close to $700 million per year, the investments Mark just talked about in terms of doubling our sales force.  You mentioned M&A, we have an active funnel development process, but we'll remain patient and disciplined when it comes to that, but we are out there actively looking for opportunities to add value – add value through acquisitions. And then we're returning capital as well, right? We have, I think, $335 million remaining on the authorization that we have outstanding, which is $75 million worth of stock this last quarter. And so, I think you'll see us continue to strike that balance and will trade off amongst those categories as appropriate over time.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup Investments. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you. And I have two questions now and at the same time so you can take them in any order that you'd like to. If I heard correctly, it sounds like the coronavirus you believe is just a push out. So, the question I have is, does it impact the revenue guidance only in the revenues or did it also impact the orders? And the reason why I ask is the orders I believe were up about 12% year-over-year, up 11% on a core basis, which looks like the orders actually reaccelerated, but I understand the coronavirus on sales. I just don't know about the impact orders or some hesitancy on orders also. Then my second question is, when we think about you expanding your sales force, you mentioned kind of across all the front lines in all regions. Is it also going into more different types of work like more higher volume or still very focused on the R&D side of things or how should we kind of think about you guys really putting up a lot of more resources behind the sales force expansion? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Jim. I'll start off first with the coronavirus. First of all, we didn't see any impact on Q1 orders. As you know, our Q1 ends at the end of January and right near the end of January a matter of fact I was in China I think it was the third week of January. People were at that point starting to head out for Chinese New Year. So, people had planned ahead, so that's great. Going forward in Q2, we're assuming, it will hit us with about 2% or 3%, but we're very happy with our backlog situation and accordingly we've guided the revenue as we did.
Mark Wallace: And Jim, this is Mark. I will make a few more comments. I don't want to steal all the thunder from next week, but there's basically three areas that we're concentrating and deploying more selling capacity. One is, we've talked a lot about acquiring new customers and increasing our reach into the geographies to diversify and broaden our business. So, we're continuing on that. We are also deploying e-commerce as part of that as well from an efficiency standpoint. Our focus on solutions remains one of our top priorities and that includes how we sell and the value we contribute to our customers. And the third area of concentrated focus is around services and selling our software portfolio. A year-and-a-half ago, we launched a services sales channel and we continue to expand that including a focus on the renewal part of our business, which is helping to feed and grow our recurring revenue. So, again, more coming next week. I appreciate the interest.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much. It's greatly appreciated. We'll see you next week.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Yun: Hi, guys. Nice to see all-time high kind of gross margins. I had a few questions on your...
Ron Nersesian: Thanks.
Brian Yun: ...software opportunity. First, are you able to share what software is as a percent of revenues this quarter? And then, just broadly, if you can talk about how software is being purchased today, what percent of sales or licenses versus subscription and if you see that changing over the next few years? And then, finally, I think the 5G test measurement software use case is very clear, but maybe if you can expand on the automotive software opportunity.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Let me just make a couple of comments with regards to software. Orders grew double-digits. Revenue grew single digits, but the growth was driven a lot by our network emulation solutions and our network assurance business. The great thing is and why we see the order growth higher than the revenue growth, we continue to shift our portfolio from more and more subscription services over time so we could see more recurring revenue. And we're working on increasing our ARR, and that's not an instantaneous change, but we're very pleased with the direction that we're taking.
Neil Dougherty: And then, I will just add that, the – what we're providing to our customers are complete solutions, and that's the combination of hardware and software and the services. So, all of this is coming together around the solutions play, whether it's around our 5G or a network application security solutions, or as you mentioned the automotive solutions, that is a large and growing part of our portfolio. And I think the difference that's occurring now is accelerating is the way customers consume those applications in terms of a more of a subscription based model. So, over time, we're supporting them with updates through a renewal process or through services, which support the application that's being deployed whether it's automotive or 5G.
Brian Yun: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes that question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Okay. Thanks, Josh. I'll turn it over to Ron to close this up.
Ron Nersesian: Well, thank you everyone for attending. As you probably know, we're very pleased with the performance that we have. And we've seen in Q1 and we were very pleased with the long-term prospects of Keysight. And we look forward to seeing many of you next week for our annual or biannual Analyst Day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q4  (2019-11-26 16:30:00) =====

Ron Nersesian: Thank you Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding quarter as we executed on our strategy and exceeded our commitments. This fiscal year 2019 was also an exceptional year of record performance as our strategy of innovation and differentiation solidified Keysight's leadership in our target markets. Today, I will focus my formal comments on three key headlines. First, Keysight finished the year with both record quarterly and annual performance. In Q4 and in fiscal year 2019, in total we achieved record orders, record revenue, record gross margin, record operating margin, and record EPS. For the full year, revenue grew 10% to reach $4.3 billion. We achieved 11% core revenue growth while generating 63% gross margin, 24% operating margin, and delivering a record 46% year-over-year EPS growth. Second, we are well-positioned for continued growth with a broad and differentiated portfolio of solutions targeted at the fastest growing segments of our end-markets. Our focus on the long-term secular growth rate trends in 5G, next-generation auto, networking, IoT, and defense modernization give us confidence in our ability to drive above-market growth even in times of macroeconomic uncertainty. Third, over the last five years since launching Keysight, we have successfully executed a strategy to grow our business and improve our financial performance. Our industry-focused solutions, targeted R&D investments, acquisitions, and operational rigor have enabled Keysight to deliver compounded annual revenue growth of 11% and compounded annual EPS growth of 17% since becoming an independent public company. Now, let's take a deeper look into our record-setting performance across the business. In the fourth quarter, we achieved record earnings of $1.33 per share which was $0.13 above the high-end of our guidance and represents 31% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered record orders in the fourth quarter. Orders of $1,194 million grew 6% year-over-year and 7% on a core basis. Excluding the unfavorable impact of trade restrictions of one of our larger customers in China, orders grew 10% reflecting the strength of our broad portfolio of solutions and extensive customer reach. Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue. Q4 revenue of $1,122 million grew 7% both on a reported and core basis. This quarter, we continue to see good growth in commercial communications, where we have strong differentiation in 5G as well as strength in U.S. aerospace defense solutions. Our Ixia Solutions Group delivered double digit order growth and 15% revenue growth as network visibility remains strong and network tests grew double digits driven by increased investment in 400 gigabit Ethernet solutions. 2019 was truly a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 9%, or 10% on a core basis despite macro uncertainties and global trade tensions. Total orders for the year were $4.4 billion, a new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 10%, or 11% on a core basis, to a record $4.3 billion. We achieved this growth while increasing gross margin by 280 basis points and operating margin by 520 basis points year-over-year. This resulted in approximately $1 billion in both operating income and cash flow from operations. 2019 earnings per share of $4.72 were up 46% over the last year. Our results this year were driven by the strength of our software-based solutions, broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business, and the customer focus and operational discipline of our Keysight Leadership Model. Now I will share some data points that illustrate the strength of our business in a few key areas. Orders for our software solutions grew 19% in 2019 to reach $853 million, representing 19% of total Keysight orders for the year. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, design software, and network visibility solutions. Our recent announcement of the PathWave Test 2020 software suite represented a significant milestone in the ongoing development and deployment of Keysight's PathWave software strategy. PathWave Desktop Edition, the latest PathWave release, delivers an integrated experience for leading electronics manufacturers, accelerating the time-to-market of their digital and wireless platforms and products, including 5G, IoT and automotive electronics. Services are another important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We achieved all-time highs for both services orders and services revenues for the fourth quarter and the full year. Aligning our services business with our industry-focused business groups at the beginning of the fiscal year was the next-level growth catalyst that we expected. I am pleased to report that we achieved over $550 million in services orders this year. Momentum for our services offering continues to build across multiple end-markets. We are also seeing good adoption of our new support offerings, such as KeysightCare, which contributes positively to our margin expansion efforts. Notably, the combination of our services and software solutions now account for over 30% of Keysight’s orders.  Moving to our markets. Our comprehensive suite of 5G solutions is driving strong growth in commercial communications as investment across the ecosystems is scaling ahead of deployments. Our broad, differentiated portfolio and leadership in this fast-growing market position us well as the market expands. Another recent example of 5G leadership is the validation of our 5G conformance test solutions by the Global Certification Forum. Our conformance platform has been adopted by all major test labs worldwide as the industry prepares for 5G device certification ahead of commercial launches. In automotive and energy, our revenues grew high single digits for the full year and we continue to see investment in next-generation technologies despite a slowdown in auto production. One example of this next-generation technology investment is in battery formation. This is a core process used in the manufacture of electric vehicle batteries where specialized equipment must be used to generate accurate voltages and currents to charge and discharge a battery. We recently achieved an important win using our battery formation test technology. This solution demonstrates our ability to combine differentiated software and hardware capabilities from multiple R&D teams, spanning Germany, Colorado, New Jersey and Keysight Labs. In our Ixia Solutions Group, both network visibility and network test revenues grew double digits year-over-year in Q4. Network visibility growth remained strong and we see future opportunities to expand our footprint with enterprises deploying dedicated networks. Network test strength was driven by 400 gigabit Ethernet investment in Layer 2, 3 protocol solutions as well as security applications. Our network test solutions have been adopted by many of the large industry players and span this ecosystem from NEMs to ODMs. The differentiated capability of our AresONE 400 gigabit Ethernet platform and our global sales reach position us well to capture the investment expected in 2020. In addition, the integration of ISG into our Communications Solutions Group, which we announced last quarter, is expected to accelerate solution synergies in 5G as the technology is deployed globally. In conjunction with our strong financial performance and execution, Keysight remains committed to our corporate social responsibility vision, which includes the environment, communities, responsible sourcing, ethical governance and our own people and solutions. We continue to be recognized for our efforts by inclusion in multiple CSR-focused indices, most recently the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Importantly, we outlined key impact goals and our progress in our CSR report earlier this year. To highlight just a few of these results, we have engaged with over 400,000 students and future engineers through STEM education programs and reduced our global energy and water consumption by 7% and 18% respectively. In summary, 2019 has been an exceptional year of great success and record revenue and earnings. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well-positioned to expand our leadership as markets evolve. Our financial performance and growth across multiple dimensions of the business are a validation of our strategy to offer customers full solutions that include both software and services. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation and create even more value for our customers and shareholders while we outgrow the market. Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank all of our Keysight employees for their dedication and hard work that made our success over the past five years possible. It is an exciting time at Keysight and we believe we are still just getting started.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you Ron and hello everyone. Before I begin, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year 2019. We continued to execute on our strategy for growth, while maintaining focus on operational excellence. For the fourth quarter of 2019, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,122 million, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 7% on a core basis. Our better-than-expected Q4 revenue results were driven primarily by continued strong demand where we have a leading position and differentiated solutions in the market such as 5G, aerospace defense, network visibility and general electronics. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue once again this quarter. We delivered a record $1,194 million in orders, up 6% in total and 7% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q4. We reported record gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $426 million, resulting in an operating margin of 26%, the highest quarterly operating margin in Keysight's history. We also achieved net income of $254 million and delivered $1.33 in earnings per share, which was well above the high-end of our guidance and an increase of 31% year-over-year. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $706 million, up 7%, while delivering gross margin of 63% and an all-time high operating margin of just over 28%. In Q4, Commercial communications delivered record revenue of $443 million, up 9%, driven by strength across the wireless ecosystem as 5G investment continues to build. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $263 million, an increase of 5% on a core basis versus a prior all-time high in Q4 last year. Growth was driven by U.S. government year-end spending and continued investment in China, offset by softness in Europe and the rest of Asia. Orders for this end-market grew double digits and we continue to see investment in advanced technology modernization and solutions, such as cyber electromagnetic activities. For the year, CSG revenue grew 12% to reach $2,688 million. EISG generated fourth quarter revenue of $284 million, up 3%, driven by strength in the broad portfolio of products that serve our general electronics market, on-going investment in next-gen auto technologies and better-than-anticipated semiconductor solution demand. EISG reported record gross margin of over 62% and operating margin of 28%. For the year, EISG revenue grew 6% to reach $1,135 million. ISG reported Q4 revenue of $132 million, a record since the acquisition of Ixia which represents 15% growth over last year with double digit revenue growth in both network test and visibility solutions. ISG reported gross margin of 72% and operating margin of 9%. As a reminder, this does not include the full benefit of the approximately $50 million in net annualized cost synergies we generated from the transaction, of which about 70% are being realized within CSG and EISG. In Q1, we will align ISG with our commercial communications end-market, including global sales. At that time, we will report ISG results within our Communications Solutions Group, which will provide solutions across the entire communications ecosystem, both end-to-end and up-and-down the stack. As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2019 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $4.3 billion and gross margin improved 280 basis points to 63%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continued to invest in R&D while maintaining strong operation discipline. As a result, operating margin improved 520 basis points to 24%. This translated to strong 46% earnings growth as we reported non-GAAP net income of $902 million, or $4.72 per share for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $263 million and free cash flow of $233 million, which represents 21% of revenue. This brings free cash flow for the year to $878 million, which was 20% of revenue and 97% of non-GAAP net income, well ahead of our 80% to 90% free cash flow conversion target for the year. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter we acquired approximately 300,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $98.30, for a total consideration of approximately $30 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2.1 million shares at an average share price of $76.32, for a total consideration of $160 million. Before moving to our outlook, I would like to remind you about the trade restrictions impacting one of our larger customers in China and the unfavorable impact this will have on our year-over-year comparisons in fiscal 2020. Specifically, this customer represented 6% of revenue in Q1 of 2019 and approximately 4% of revenue in Q2, or just under 5% of revenue for the first half of 2019. Due to on-going trade concerns, we now expect this customer to be approximately 1% of revenue going forward, which represents a five point headwind in Q1 and a three point headwind in Q2 of 2020. Virtually all of this unfavorable year-over-year impact will be reflected in the commercial communications end-market. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2020 revenue to be in the range of $1,045 million to $1,065 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.04 to $1.10, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. For 2020 modeling purposes, we typically expect seasonally higher revenues in Q2 and Q4 versus Q1 and Q3. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $80 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $120 million to 130 million. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY2020. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you Neil. Christine, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks, good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Good afternoon.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, maybe to start with you in terms of the quarter. Could you just sort of spike out what areas of the business specifically kind of outperformed relative to your plan? And kind of maybe any color you can share with us in terms of how Huawei came in relative to what you had embedded in the guidance on the revenue line for the period?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. I will just make a couple of comments and I will turn it over to Neil to give you the precise numbers with regards to Huawei. Hello, can you hear me, Brandon?
Brandon Couillard: Yes. I can now.
Ron Nersesian: Okay. Very good. The biggest surprise was Ixia. Ixia performed extremely well with 12% order growth and 15% revenue growth, and profitability that was at 9%, not including about seven points of benefit that gets a portion effectively to the other groups due to synergies that are represented in other P&Ls. So, we were very pleased with that and it was great to see not only network visibility but also network test turn on with the acceleration of 400 gigabit Ethernet solutions, which we have talked about in the past. We had mentioned in the past that it would take a little longer for that to turn on. So that was one. The other thing was 5G continues to be exceptionally strong. We had very high double digit growth there for the quarter and we had triple digit order growth there for the year, so we still see very strong momentum in 5G. The semiconductor business had a very good order pick up, not so much on the revenue side, yet you will see that flow later, but that was also very encouraging to see semiconductors turn on as we look at people investing more for 7-nanometer and 5-nanometer solutions where we played very strongly. Also aerospace defense was very solid. And we saw double digit order growth in aerospace defense in the quarter, and that's just the start.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Brandon, and then you asked a question about Huawei. The actual impact of Huawei on the revenue line was relatively small. Where we saw a bigger impact was in the order line. On a year-over-year basis, in Q4 orders directly to Huawei were down about $40 million and that includes approximately $20 million of orders which we took off the books due to just no direct path to be able to ship them in the immediate future. And so, we have debooked about $20 million in the quarter from that perspective as well.
Brandon Couillard: Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then as we think about the full year, Ron, any greater sort of goalposts you can give us in terms of how you are thinking about topline for fiscal 2020? I mean if we just look at the first quarter, you are kind of guiding to 5% which is at the high end of sort of your mid-term model. You know you lapped the toughest comp of the year, and you have got a 5% headwind from Huawei restrictions. Any finer point you can just sort of share with us in terms of full year topline outlook?
Ron Nersesian: Unfortunately, we are not going to be sharing the details beyond Q1 at this point. But I am going to announce that we will be doing an Investor and Analyst Day in New York City in March where we will get a chance to talk about our model and our model going forward. As you have seen some of our results, we have pretty much blown through all of the commitments we made. For instance, 4% to 5% core growth on revenue. We have delivered 11% the last five years. When you look at gross margin, we said in 2018 we would get to 61% to 63% by 2021. We are here in 2019. We already hit 63% operating margin. We said 21% to 22%, and we delivered 24% for the year. Again, that's above what we had committed to two years ahead of schedule. And the same thing with EPS growth. We have delivered 17% EPS growth versus our commitment of greater than 10%, and we did the same thing in free cash flow conversion. So we will get a chance at the Analyst Day to give you more details on the model going forward, but we are very pleased to have exceeded those commitments and we see more opportunity in front of us.
Brandon Couillard: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Just two on the 5G side, if I could. First, could you just update us on kind of competitive landscape and what you are seeing there and any impacts that you might expect market share or pricing, anything like that? And then just following up on China, a lot of moving parts over there. But I would love your take on, obviously we are seeing an acceleration and pull-in of 5G. So, what does that mean for you guys? What does that mean as far as R&D and manufacturing? And with the Huawei ban, they are taking share. So, what do you think that means longer term? Is that business that could come back to you or do you see enough strength with the other players there? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Tim, I am going to turn the first question on 5G over to Satish who runs that business and then have Mark, who is the Head of Sales, talk about talk about China and the Huawei impact.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Tim, first to the aspect of differentiation. The breadth of our portfolio combined with the leadership that we continue to maintain is clearly evident across the ecosystem. The extensibility of our platform, the experience we have gained through all the early collaborations and now with ISG or Ixia capabilities, we are layering on additional capability to help our customers scale and navigate through the challenges of 5G. Through the quarter, as Ron mentioned, very strong quarter for 5G orders. All regions grew from an order perspective. And our commercial communications group grew double digits in revenue, if you exclude the impact of the one customer that we just referenced. Very strong strength in orders from a device ecosystem, particularly the Tier 1, Tier 2 players. The test labs, the operators around the world are embracing our platform. So I would say, both for the quarter and for the year, very strong performance in 5G from traditional customers. But we also saw some 5G orders starting to appear from automotive customers as an example as 5G starts to scale. So when we look forward to 2020, I continue to believe given the massive commercialization that's occurring around the world, the runway that's there with millimeter wave adoption where customers are investing early for that, we think 2020 will be a big year for 5G adoption and we are very well-positioned because of the strength of our portfolio, as I mentioned before. And I will hand it off to Mark to make some comments on China.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks Satish. So Tim, we have talked about China in the past and it really hasn't changed. It's a very important market for us. We are deeply engaged with all the industry-leading customers, all of our customers over there. In Q4, our business in China was just above the historical average of 17% to 18% with strong growth across virtually every segment from general electronics to automotive to semiconductor and commercial comms. So the one customer that we are talking about is certainly a part of that but we have a very, very broad business, broad set of industries, broad set of solutions around the world and China is no different. And as I look forward, the automotive element continues to grow. Satish mentioned this. It has a tie-in to 5G and our solutions are really providing a lot of value to our customers around the world and including China. So we are very close to the situation. We will keep a close eye on it and continue to monitor the situation closely.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi guys. Thanks very much for taking the question. I guess my first question is, I was hoping you could provide us with the split of your business between R&D test and production test, specifically in comms in fiscal 2019 and how you see that evolving into fiscal 2020? And I realize you have got a lot of inputs when you think about margins but how would that evolution impact margins going forward as well? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Toshiya, thanks for the question. So first of all, let's start at the highest level where we are approaching 60% of R&D and other pre-deployment types of solutions with manufacturing being close to 40%. So that's roughly the split. We haven't given that split for other businesses but certainly in commercial comms which is being driven by 5G, that is probably more heavily skewed towards R&D at this point than the overall business. So I think we can say that very clearly. But you can think of it about as a 60-40 split for the company in total.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Great. And then as my follow-up on Huawei specifically. The 3% to 5% headwind for Q1 and Q2 of this fiscal year, is that a 100% due to the export ban? Or are they not taking product that you can actually ship as well? Meaning like, are the demand signals from that specific customer deteriorating over time? Thank you.
Mark Wallace: So this is Mark. I will answer that. It is related to the restrictions that are preventing us from shipping some products during the first quarter. So the demand is continuing but the products that we are able to ship is limited.
Ron Nersesian: As we think about that situation where broadly obviously we have got the Huawei situation specifically, you have got trade more broadly, you have got things like the election and general manufacturing headwinds that have us a little bit more cautious going into FY2020. I think as we look at it though, we continue to believe that our end-markets grow in the low to mid single digits and that we are well-positioned as a result of our portfolio of solutions to continue to outgrow the market even in light of those headwinds and even with the Huawei situation that we are facing here in 2020 heavily weighted obviously towards the first half.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open.
Mehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to your networking test that is actually better than expected. I remember last earnings conference call you talked about that particular segment of Ixia should pick up later in Fy2020 and now we are seeing better-than-expected traction. I wanted to understand the dynamics here what's driving and to what extent this is more of an R&D and if that's the case, when do you expect production-related orders and revenue were to come in? And then I have a follow up.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I would take it. Yes. hi. I would say that we are very pleased, as Ron mentioned, with the recovery in the test business in Q4 maybe slightly ahead of our expectations. But I would attribute it to two factors. One is a slightly improving market dynamic associated with 400 gig where customers or new customers are entering that ecosystem and trying to innovate to address the technology challenges and help scale the technology. And the second one is really the differentiation of our platform and our solution AresONE that we announced last year in October that continued to build strength through the year. So to a large degree, you could say that most of the applications currently AresONE is going into is in the R&D/ early, very early validation phase where people are using it for more automated testing. The rest of our 400 gig portfolio continues to be strong as well in the physical layer including in production test where we had a pretty significant manufacturing test win this quarter. But our sort of outlook for 400 gig is a very steady sort of demand through the year at this point.
Mehdi Hosseini: Sure. And just a quick follow-up to that. You highlighted new type of customers. Are these like a hyperscalers or is it the original equipment makers, ODMs or OEMs?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. We saw strength across the ecosystem including the ones you referenced.
Mehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you. And just if I may, just as my second question. When you look at your orders and you highlighted semis were a strong in new booking but it's not really impacting your Q1 revenue. So would the semi bookings will start to flow into Q2? And will that also help Q2 as a stronger quarter relative to Q1?
Ron Nersesian: Well, first of all, a lot of the bookings that we received in Q4 will flow out in Q1 not Q2. But the guide that we gave you encompasses that.
Mehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Marchetti [ph] from Stifel. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Hi. John Marchetti here. Just a quick question, Satish. If you could go back to some of the comments on the millimeter wave strength. Just curious as you are looking out over the next 12 months or so, if you see that as an additional driver with sort of the sub-six being relatively steady? If those two are maybe moving into different phases? Just how you think of maybe some of those two different technologies playing out for you over the next 12-months or so?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. It's a really good question. I would say that you are very insightful in that a lot of activity that you see that is an a public domain is related to Asia and some of the ramps are happening there in the sub-six gigahertz band. But what we see is also capability building out for a potential millimeter wave ramp 2021, 2022 where customers are buying ahead of it. The strength of our platform, I touched upon the extensibility of it. It allows customers to move from sib-six gigahertz to millimeter wave SA and NSA seamlessly. And that really gives us a strong portfolio and competitive differentiation that we are benefiting from. The other angle that I will probably highlight is the complexity with 5G even though there are some early 60 operators have deployed some sort of commercial service with 5G. As we start to learn from those deployments, the complexities informing greater investment in R&D driven by some of the dynamics such as over 2,000 band combinations.
John Marchetti: Thank you. And is that primarily still with OEMS? Or are you seeing increasing demand from the service provider community as well?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Across the ecosystem and in particular in Q4 we saw strength from the top service providers who are embracing our platform.
John Marchetti: Great. And then Neil, if I can just, as I look back on 2019, you had relatively stable spending levels, operating expenses as you went through the year. Just curious as we look out into 2020, any sort of big ticket items or any sort of things to be aware of as we are looking at those OpEx levels heading into next fiscal year?
Neil Dougherty: Nothing specific. The one thing that I would say is that we do continue to model internally 16% of revenue going towards R&D spend. We were a little bit under that in the back half of 2019. But as we move into 2020, we continue to be anchored on 16% of revenue going into R&D.
John Marchetti: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks John.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane from Bank of America. Your line is open.
David Ridley-Lane: Thank you. I had a question on the $550 million in services orders this year. Do you have a comparable figure for the prior-year? Or could you give us a sense of the growth rate on that services business?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. So I will make a couple of comments about that. If you remember, this business was a $400 million business for many, many years. And if you actually went back to our very first Analyst Day after the launch of Keysight, we talked about growing this business to being a $600 million business and being able to do that by 2020. We are not going to hit that target on the revenue line next year, but we would expect that we would be able to come very close to delivering $600 million in orders in 2020. So on a very nice trajectory and continue to see great growth in that business. And it's an important part of our overall solutions offering.
Neil Dougherty: And just to answer the last part of your question, services grew double-digits in FY 2019.
David Ridley-Lane: Okay. And then on software sales, can you give a sense of how that sales process is going? Are you displacing existing software providers? Or is this more about when you do get a new program win, you are having better success about adding software to that program win?
Mark Wallace: Yes. David, this is Mark Wallace. I will take that. So software is an ever-increasing part of our overall solution as we are delivering complete solutions to our customers. So that's a piece of it. We have also been very successful in implementing our software business model and our go-to-market strategy. So when we are selling software that's got a perpetual license, we sell support with that. We are now being successful with growing new business model offerings with time-based licenses. And we are always adding new features and capabilities, as an example that Ron talked about with PathWave 2020. So it's a combination of all those things.
Ron Nersesian: If you break it down, there are three main parts. One is our design software or EDA design software. The second is application software that gives customers answers versus just lots of numbers. And the third is platforms. And platforms such as PathWave will help tie everything together throughout the complete workflow. On top of that, we provide all types of software updates and that's why we are very pleased to see our over $850 million worth of software. You couple that with our services business, our ARR or recurring revenue continues to increase, which is the one of the strategies of our company. And just we had mentioned earlier, software orders were up 19% for the year and revenue was double digits at a lower level, but that's only because it gets recognized over time.
David Ridley-Lane: All right. Thank you very much.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks David.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Good afternoon.
Richard Eastman: So very quickly, just to return for a second to Huawei. The discussion around the headwind in the first half of the year is reasonably consistent with what you had laid out. But I am curious when you look at the combination of Huawei and HiSilicon, do you expect the revenue of the combination to those one or two customers, however, you define them, do you expect the revenue to be up in fiscal 2020 versus 2019?
Neil Dougherty: No. We consider HiSilicon to be part of Huawei. And so we have a pretty significant headwind as it relates to that combination of customers. Roughly 2% total for the year, but pretty heavily skewed towards the first half with a 5% headwind in Q1 and a 3% revenue headwind in Q2. So it's definitely down from that set of customers over the [indiscernible].
Richard Eastman: Okay. So you consider them the same entity which I guess they are. But I am curious, in the past, historically, Keysight has had a very, very strong position on kind of the base station test side, manufacturing test within infrastructure. And I am curious where are we in that growth curve? Does Keysight expect to hold share there? And if so, would that business not ramp into fiscal 2020?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. This is a good question. We have secured some early design wins this year that positions us well for the production ramps in 5G. So if you look at it in aggregate, we will maintain or gain position, especially as new forms of base stations, such as millimeter-wave and CPE devices become proliferate across the ecosystem. So we are well-positioned by the products and solutions that we have already had design wins with. And we are also layering in additional capability with PathWave that Ron just referenced where we have been working with Nokia to further accelerate some of the testing needs for base station manufacturers. And I just want to add also that this quarter and for the whole year as well, we had significant uptick for our modular vector network analyzers which are largely used for base station filter manufacturing. We have high share historically and we continue to do well in that market.
Ron Nersesian: And Rick, back to your original question with regards to Huawei and HiSilicon, let me just step back a little bit and talk about China. We were successful this last quarter of crossing the $1 billion mark in orders into China. And the reason I bring that up is we have a very broad portfolio across many end-markets and that is something that is a strength and continues to grow very well.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just a follow-up question. Ron, you had made a comment around the aerospace, defense business and kind of noteworthy, the orders were there plus double digits, revenue was kind of mid single digits, but you made the comment that kind of more to come. But does the order, again I don't know what the shipping cycle would be on the orders, the double- digit orders. But is there an order and momentum backlog around in the A&D business that might suggest you have got line of sight on mid single-digit type growth through 2020 because I think that that business tends to flow out of backlog at more of a six to 12 month pace?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. To put it simply, I think some of the order strength that we saw was successful adoption of our electronic warfare or threat simulation platforms that Neil referenced to cyber and electromagnetic activities. And we are now embedded with all the major labs in the U.S. and some in Europe for that solution. And since it's a solution, it has a longer gestation period between orders and revenue. Now with regard to the outlook, at least for Q1, we continue to see order strength and funnel is very strong for our offerings. Obviously, we monitor the budget situation in the United States as that process evolves.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Yes.
Ron Nersesian: And given our position with the government, not only is it a solution play, which makes it longer but also through the overall buying cycle is longer. So there is a bit of hysteresis in that process, which provides more stability in the business.
Richard Eastman: Got you. Okay. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup Investments. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you. And I have two questions and I will ask them at the same time so you can answer them whichever order you feel is best. On the Huawei status, there are some companies that have been putting in applications to the government about being able to still be able to sell to them in the future. I assume Keysight has done this. Did you get a response? Are you still in the waiting pattern of that? Or any feedback on that? Because I know that there are some companies who are getting positives, yes, they can continue to ship in the future? Or is it simply, it's not going to happen much? How should we think about that? And then my second question is on the orders that you gave, I mean they are positive, but there has been a meaningful deceleration from that. It seems like that there will also be maybe is it a one percentage point or two percentage point because of Huawei from that, but also the orders deceleration, is it mostly macro related or trade tensions or peaking of 5G R&D test equipment? How should we think about that? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Let me take the second part of that first and then we will let Satish handle the first part. So as we said on the order line, we saw a $40 million impact from Huawei within the quarter. So that's four points, roughly 4 points at the Keysight level, but a much greater level at either the CSG or commercial communications level, which is where that business is very heavily skewed. So we definitely are seeing an impact. But we are offsetting that and making it up via the strength of our portfolio and the broad set of customers that we have that are adopting those commercial communications solutions.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. With regard to your first question, it's a pretty dynamic situation. We monitor this carefully. Some of the announcements on licensing as we read it applies to very low-end technology capabilities, if at that. So it does not apply to some of the capabilities that we offer. At this time now, again, we monitor the situation and remain compliant with U.S. DOC norms. Thank you.
Jim Suva: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: I will just add one other comment that I made a comment earlier that our China orders were over $1 billion, I was referring to Greater China and Greater China obviously includes Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as Mainland China and that's how we look at the business. But just for clarification.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi. Good afternoon guys. congrats on a great quarter and a great year.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi Ron. I guess I hear you that you don't want to steal from the upcoming Analyst Day, but you are guiding Q1 operating margins up about 200 basis points year-over-year, I think. And then I mean how would you model the rest of the year? Kind of flattish? Up 50 basis points? I am just trying to figure how to read your comments on that.
Ron Nersesian: Typically we talk about having a softer Q1 given the strong year end that we typically have as the way we finished our year from a sales perspective and we have people on year-end compensation. So we tend to start out slow in Q1. We do salary administration for the whole company in the first quarter of the year, which can put some downward pressure on operating margins for that first quarter. I think as we think about the whole fiscal year, I would guide you back to the kind of the macro level statements we have made in the past. Market growth in the 3% to 5%, us looking to outpace the markets even in the face of the headwinds that we have talked about. When we grow mid single digits or better, we can deliver a 40% incremental to the bottom line. So there is room for increased profitability even from where we are today. Obviously, we did a much better than that incremental this year, but we have come very far, very fast. And I don't think we are going to sustain the 90%-plus incremental that we have put up this year. But you can definitely think about that 40% incremental as a good way to model our business going forward.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. That's fine. And then I wanted to ask about Europe. It seems like you are seeing some broad-based weakness there which perhaps is nothing new. Are you seeing any green shoots in Europe?
Mark Wallace: Yes. Adam, this is Mark. It's a mixed bag in Europe. We did see some lower investments from some of the network equipment manufacturers, some of the chipset companies. There were some mixed results in aerospace, defense with some of the Western European primes. Russia was down. What's really showing though is that our general electronics business is up with growth from the broad portfolio of solutions that we have. We have invested in IoT-based solutions for a number of companies into education and research and we continue to grow that business and new customers across Western Europe. Another bright spot is the expansion of our Scienlab solutions to many customers around the world as well as across Europe. So it was mixed and those are the headlines.
Ron Nersesian: I will just add a comment that Europe is only 15% of our business or was 15% of our business as we looked at the last quarter. And in addition to the GEMS business or the general electronics business and Scienlab that Mark talked about, we also saw network test grow in Ixia.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. Understood. Thanks guys.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Yun: Hi guys. I really appreciate the color on the software solutions revenues. So I just had two questions around that. First, how should we think about sort of the ramp in software revenues over the next couple of years? And are there any goals or initiatives focused on driving software growth specifically? And then second, you kind of broke out the three key pieces of software you sell today. Could you maybe rank order which ones you see the largest opportunities in?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean I definitely think we have continued opportunity to grow software as an overall percentage of the portfolio as we continue this migration from just selling essentially test and design tools to selling complete solutions for our customers. Those solutions have much higher software and services content and that's definitely a trend that has a lot of runway in front of it. I think as you look forward, the big opportunities, I continue to point at 5G. We have very high software content in some of our cutting edge 5G solutions. So that's a big driver of growth, but it's also a big opportunity for us as we look forward, given that we are still in the very early stages of 5G deployment. Ron talked about our EDA tools. We already have very high market share in EDA. And so we are kind of growing with the market more than anything else in the EDA space. And then we are very excited about our PathWave platform, right, where we announced it a while back, but we are going to be designing tools into our PathWave platform for many years to come. And we are really just getting started in terms of connecting the workflow for our customers. And so I think there is a big opportunity for us as it relates to PathWave. And then the last thing that I would just comment on is another big opportunity that we see is the opportunity to take more and more of our software and convert it from kind of one-time sales to more time-based sales. I would say, we are a little bit behind industry norms as it relates to that, but that creates a big opportunity for us as we look forward.
Ron Nersesian: I would just add on software. Just to step back, when we launched the company, we had roughly $370 million worth of software orders and software revenue. And we finished this year with $853 million. So we have dramatically grown our software portfolio. And as Neil mentioned, we have much more opportunity in front of us.
Brian Yun: Awesome. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Well, thank you Christine and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming conferences. And have a great day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q3  (2019-08-21 16:30:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Rob and I will be your lead operator today.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our differentiated strategy, relentless focus on execution, and commitment to operational discipline continue to generate strong financial results. I will focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, Keysight delivered another strong quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Record third quarter revenue grew 8% year-over-year, or 9% on a core basis. Our differentiated solutions, software and services continue to fuel our growth across a broad portfolio of customers. And equally important, our strong culture of execution and commitment to operational excellence continues to drive our record performance on the bottom line. This quarter, we achieved record operating margin of 25%, and earnings of $1.25 per share and earnings growth of 41%. We also generated record free cash flow of $244 million. Second, we continue to see customers make R&D investments in certain next-generation technologies, such as 5G, across multiple end-markets. However, our macro environment concerns remain, and we continue to anticipate headwinds resulting from trade tensions with China. Despite these dynamics, given our broad portfolio of customers and solutions, we believe we are in a strong position to drive above market growth even in times of economic uncertainty. Third, given our continued success in the market and strong performance in Q3, we are raising our revenue and earnings outlook for the year. We now expect revenue growth between 9% and 10%, and earnings growth between 40% and 42% for the full fiscal year. Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the third quarter. We achieved $1.25 per share in earnings, which was $0.24 above the midpoint and $0.20 above the high-end of our guidance. This represents our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth, and earnings growing 41% for the quarter and 52% year-to-date. Revenue grew 8% year-over-year, or 9% on a core basis, to surpass $1 billion and reach a new third quarter record for Keysight. This brings our year-to-date revenue growth to 13% on a core basis. We also delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 10%, both in total and on a core basis, to exceed $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter. As a reminder, our core metrics exclude the impact of currency movements and revenue from acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. Software orders grew double digits in the quarter. Our portfolio of solutions, comprised of leading software, hardware, and services capabilities, is at the core of our competitive differentiation, and further strengthens Keysight as a strategic partner to customers. Building on our commitment to help customers accelerate their innovations through software, Keysight recently collaborated with Nokia to launch the Open Test Automation Project, which we refer to as OpenTap.  This new collaboration provides an open-source, scalable architecture for automated test solutions and enables innovation in new technologies and increased development efficiency. Customers can also extend their OpenTAP capabilities through additional commercial offerings in our PathWave lineup. Our ability to expand our software capabilities across the total communications workflow through acquisitions has generated strong returns for Keysight. This began with the acquisition of Anite in 2015, which was a key enabler of our 5G platform. Our expansion into the software layers of test with Anite has resulted in significant share gains in the 5G market. As we move forward, we see increased opportunities to make greater contributions to our customers’ workflow. To that end, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of Prisma Telecom Testing. Based in Milan, Italy, Prisma has deep software expertise and a decades-long track record of delivering network equipment manufacturer solutions. This acquisition further enhances our ability to deliver leading edge end-to-end solutions across the entire communications ecosystem. Moving to our markets, Commercial Communications drove considerable upside in the quarter with double-digit order and revenue growth. This growth was driven by another exceptional quarter of 5G orders, where we believe we have strong technology leadership over the competition. Keysight’s 5G success is a result of our first-to-market innovations and engagement with leading-edge market makers across the wireless R&D ecosystem. We are proud of the many industry breakthroughs that are a result of these collaborations. For example, in July we announced that our efforts with many industry leaders have resulted in the industry’s first Global Certification Forum validation of 5G test cases. This achievement, combined with our ongoing collaboration with key operators, accelerates 5G deployments globally. Looking ahead, we expect the Commercial Communications market will continue to benefit from increasing demand, driven by the complete redesign of communications systems for higher speeds and new use cases. Keysight is at the forefront with solutions designed to accelerate these innovations. In addition to R&D strength, our new modular products are doing very well in selective customer production workflows. Moving to automotive, we continue to engage with customers in the automotive electronics market for new powertrain electrification technologies and advanced electronic systems. With our acquisition of ScienLab in 2017, we have considerably extended our leadership in this market by integrating our technologies and expanding across Tier-1 customers. Automotive is an area where we continue to invest and innovate. We recently launched Keysight’s Automotive Cybersecurity Test Portfolio, which delivers hardware, software and services that address the growing concern of cyber-attacks on connected vehicles. Utilizing security solutions developed by our Ixia Solutions Group, Keysight is delivering extensive security validations of the 4G and 5G radio access network infrastructure that connects vehicles, and the backend data centers that manage business operations. Additionally, network visibility solutions deliver an enhanced infrastructure that improves the efficiency of security toolsets in production networks. With the combined technology portfolios of Keysight, Anite, Ixia, as well as Prisma, we are delivering solutions across the entire communications workflow from end-to-end and up and down the stack. Beginning in Q1, we are taking the combination one-step further by integrating ISG within our Communications Solutions Group. We believe this will create improved go-to-market and product development alignment to foster growth across the ecosystem as 5G moves from the deployment phase to commercialization. 5G deployments pose complex challenges across devices, base stations and core networks on an accelerated timeframe. Keysight is uniquely positioned to offer solutions end-to-end for all these challenges. This organizational alignment will further enhance our ability to accelerate innovation in 5G. Additionally, we see future opportunities to expand our footprint within enterprises deploying dedicated networks, as our network visibility solutions provide increased actionable insight and security for mission critical applications running on these networks. In summary, Keysight has expanded its technology leadership with a diverse portfolio, while strengthening our competitive position in fast-growing, high-margin target markets. And our leadership position has delivered strong financial results. 2019 will be our fifth consecutive year of outstanding execution and operational excellence since launching Keysight.  At the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, we will deliver FY 2019 revenues of [$4.280 billion] and $4.57 in EPS. This represents a compounded annual growth rate of 11% for revenue and 16% for EPS since our first year as a public company in FY 2015. Most importantly, Keysight has achieved a leadership position across growing addressable markets and is well-positioned for continued share gains. Lastly, our commitment to excellence is deep and our DNA and extends beyond our financial performance. On that note, I’m proud to report our achievements in corporate social responsibility. We released our 2018 Corporate Social Responsibility Report in May outlining Keysight’s accomplishments in this space, including key impact results in natural resource conservation, supporting next-generation technologists through the education processes and programs, and strengthening local communities. Our continued efforts are often recognized in the industry, most recently with Keysight’s inclusion in several CSR-focused indices. I’d like to congratulate all Keysight employees for their dedication to the company’s success over the past five years, while upholding our global business framework of ethical, environmentally sustainable, and socially responsible operations. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and the outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand, we see in core areas of our business, while maintaining focus on operational excellence and superior execution. For the third quarter of 2019, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.088 billion, which was well above the high-end of our guidance range and grew 9% on a core basis. Our better than expected Q3 revenue results were driven primarily by continued strong demand in areas where we have a leading position in the market, such as 5G. This brings our total revenue growth for the first nine months of the year to 11%, or 13% core growth. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue once again this quarter. We delivered $1.110 billion in orders in Q3. Orders were up 10% in total and on a core basis. I will also highlight that in Q3, orders for services again grew double-digits on broad-based demand and good adoption of our new support offerings, such as Keysight Care. Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported strong gross margin of 63%. Our notable gross margin performance and continued strong operational discipline led to another quarter of record operating margin and earnings. We achieved 25% operating margin and net income of $239 million. On a per share basis, we delivered $1.25 in earnings, which was well above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares.  Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $683 million, up 13%, while delivering gross margin of 63% and record operating margin of 28%. In Q3, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $440 million, driven by broad strength across the wireless ecosystem as increased 5G investment continued. Aerospace, defense and government generated revenue of $243 million, an increase of 2% on a core basis. During the quarter, we continued to see steady spending in the U.S., which was offset by softness in some international markets. Order growth for this end-market was high single-digits, and we have a strong overall funnel building into Q4. EISG generated third quarter revenue of $295 million, up 3%, driven by strength in next-gen automotive and general electronics. As expected, this growth was offset by lower capital investments by our semiconductor customers. This quarter we saw strength in the broad portfolio of products that serve our general electronics end-market. EISG reported record gross margin of 62% and record operating margin of 28%. ISG reported Q3 revenue of $110 million, a 7% decline over last year. The decline in ISG revenue reflects ongoing softness in the network test market, whereas network visibility solutions generated high single-digit growth, driven by enterprise sales in the U.S. and Asia. ISG reported gross margin of 72% and 1% operating margin. As Ron mentioned, in Q1, we will implement a change to our organizational structures to align ISG with our Commercial Communications end-market, including global sales. At that time, we will report ISG results combined with our Communications Solutions Group, which will provide solutions across the entire communications ecosystem, both end-to-end and up and down the stack. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our third quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $274 million and record free cash flow of $244 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was 22% of revenue and 102% of non-GAAP net profit. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 760,000 shares on the open market, at an average price of $78.92, for a total consideration of $60 million. Before moving to our outlook, I would like to make a few comments regarding the United States Department of Commerce export control regulations that impact one of our large customers in China. As I’m sure you can appreciate, the current regulatory environment remains a fluid situation. On our last conference call, we said that we expect these trade restrictions to be a headwind to revenue growth in the second half of this year and the first half of 2020. To date, we have been able to ship some products to this customer within the current legal regulations. As a result, we expect to see a slightly smaller headwind in Q4 than previously anticipated. Due to on-going trade concerns, we continue to expect a 3 to 4-point headwind in the first half of 2020 related to this customer. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $1.080 billion to $1.100 billion. This brings our revenue growth range for the year to 9% to 10%, which is above our prior outlook of 7% to 8%. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.20, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. The midpoint of our earnings guidance implies 41% earnings growth for the full-year. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Rob, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And you first question comes from the line of John Marchetti from Stifel. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Thanks very much. Good evening guys. Just real quick on the upside in the quarter itself. I think on the last call you talked about the Huawei or the expectation of Huawei, being about a $25 million hit in the quarter. Just curious where that stands now. I know you said that in the guidance it is still a little less than you had thought, but how much of soft of that 25 million actually came through in the quarter? And as you have been going through some of your processes there and looking at what you can ship, how does that stand now in terms of what you are shipping today, versus maybe what you were shipping at least from a product perspective earlier in the year?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, John. So, it's a couple of comments. So, first of all, as it relates to Q3, we ended up shipping about a little, you know approximately $10 million more to Huawei than we had originally drawn up when we were issuing the guidance three months ago. I think as we look forward, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we do see a muting, if you will, of the risk in Q4 because we are able to ship a portion of our portfolio into Huawei. And so that impact is more muted than we had originally anticipated and we've reflected that in the guidance that we’ve provided to you for the fourth quarter. I think as we look forward, as we've mentioned, Huawei has historically been a 3% customer, approximately a 3% customer for us. They were significantly larger than that in the first half of last year and with 2020 hindsight, it's pretty clear that they were buying ahead in anticipation of trade tensions. I think – so they'll need to work through whatever incremental inventory they've built up. And so, I think as we look to next year, we would expect Huawei to be maybe a 1% or a 2% customer for us, therefore, resulting into 3-point to 4-point headwind for us in the first half of next year.
John Marchetti: Thank you. And then maybe just as a follow-up. Shifting gears, a little bit to the European market. That was certainly a little bit of a drag this quarter. Just curious if you can share some color there about what areas seem to be weaker? Is it just a sense that the general economic outlook there has deteriorated? Or is there something more to it than that? And does that become a greater concern for you as we get further into this calendar year and into early next?
Mark Wallace: Yes, John. This is Mark Wallace. I'll take that question. So, we had mixed results in Europe. During the quarter, we saw growth in 5G, as we did in every single region across the world. We saw a growth in automotive. We saw growth in education and in the general broad customer base, including research. The two areas we saw some softness that offset it was in semiconductor, which we had a pretty tough compare to this time last year, to Q3 of last year due to some acceleration of business with one of our customers there, and we saw some general softness in aerospace, defense. So, I would say it's a mixed set of markets that we experienced during the quarter as opposed to anything broader.
John Marchetti: Thank you very much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long from Barclays. Your line is open.
Tim Long: Thank you. Just two questions if I could. First, on the 5G side, I'm not sure if you gave the order number. Just curious if you can just update us on competition. Obviously, it continues to be a really strong performer for you. Just wondering what you think will happen when that segment gets a little more competitive? And then secondly, if you could just touch on Ixia. I understand the – moving it around closer to the Commercial Communications Group. Maybe if you could just touch on a little bit why there hasn't really been the same type of pull-through that we would have expected with those two businesses? And how mechanically, that you think that will change and help the Ixia Group in the next year or so? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. I'll just take the first question. This is Satish. With regard to 5G, so we continue to have strong momentum in 5G this quarter yet again and our strength is pretty broad as Mark Wallace referenced. And it's really a reflection of our portfolio, which is intended to be broad and applicable to the entire ecosystem end-to-end and across all the regions where we saw customers adopt our solutions. A particular driver that if I may highlight amongst everything is, the GSA reported that well over 100 devices have been announced for 5G most recently through the year and the number of subscribers who will have access to 5G-ready devices next year would be north of $60 million to $70 million. That's a pretty big number. And we saw that reflected in some of the R&D spend that was coming from the Tier 1 and Tier 2 players in the smartphone space. So, it continues to be strong and our differentiation holds and because of our lead in the 5G standards, we continue to do well.
Ron Nersesian: Tim, this is Ron, and I’ll take the second question and then pass it over to Mark Wallace. So, with regards to ISG, there are two different businesses there. One is network visibility and the second is network test. Network test sits right in the communications workflow and is very much connected to what happens in CSG. Network visibility is a little bit further down the line and therefore is able to get going without the integration directly. So, in network visibility, we had 9% revenue growth and we had 17% revenue growth year-to-date. So, we feel that we've integrated that business, stabilized that business, and we have turned that around and that is growing and doing well. The network test business, which is in a tough market right now really needs to play out in our next phase of our original vision. Our original vision was to provide solutions across the total communications ecosystem end-to-end and up and down the stack. And this next step in our evolution where we're combining it with the rest of CXG is something that myself and others had envisioned right from the start. And the reason is two-fold. One is product synergy and then in the product synergy area, for instance, they have introduced a 400-gig solution for AresONE, and we use part of the stack that was developed in Ixia network test in our BERTs are bit error rate testers. And there is much more opportunities on the product synergy area as we go forward. The second area is the sales synergy. I'll let Mark talk to that. But the key reason is, by pulling this together, we're finding more and more areas to drive product synergy and therefore, revenue synergy.
Mark Wallace: Yes. And Tim, this is Mark. I'll just add to what Ron just said. This product synergy is going to be amplified by the changes that we're making to reorganization and sales, which is a continuation of the transformation that we've been doing for the last three years, further scaling our footprint across all of our global markets. Leveraging these really deep account relationships and access that we've built over years and decades into some of the same customer base. And then, as Ron has mentioned and we've talked about before, really enabling us to bring the complete set of end-to-end solutions to our customers. So, I think this really ties it all together.
Ron Nersesian: And I'll just add one other comment that you may be wondering about. We had talked about at an earlier Investor Day of doubling our sales force from approximately 500 people to a 1,000. We are right on track with that. And that does not include the additional people that will move over from the Ixia sales force. So, that will be incremental of about 100 people on top of that.
Tim Long: Okay. Thank you very much.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Tim.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, Ron and Neil. Congratulations on the solid results. Ron, you guys have done a good job sort of quantifying the direct impact from Huawei. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about maybe an indirect impact that might happen. Are you seeing any changes in deployment schedules in 5G in China because of this? And when you think about the direct impact of Huawei, is this a temporary loss of business? Or do we have to worry that they might look for other potential non-U.S. suppliers to substitute you?
Ron Nersesian: Well, on your first question, yes, it is impacting 5G in China. It is accelerating our growth in that area. Our order growth was very, very strong in China in the quarter. And again, with the races on where countries are competing for 5G growth, and we saw that also in China. So, we're very pleased with the overall results in that area.
John Pitzer: And then guys maybe as my follow-up, maybe for Neil. Neil, just a little bit of nitpicking. But just when you look at the forward guidance, you're guiding revenue kind of flattish, EPS down a little bit. Just given how well you guys have done operationally on both in gross and operating margins, can you just help me square the circle little bit as to what's happening maybe either with mix and period cost that would drive EPS down a little bit on flattish revenues?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, we do have some seasonally higher expenses that we're expecting here in the coming quarter that we think will impact profitability a little bit this quarter. Obviously, we've, over the long term talked about an operating model, which delivers a 40% incremental on revenue growth and we've been over the past couple of quarters really exceeding that by a very, very large degree. So, we have some pent-up demand for expenses and some seasonality around year-end sales commissions and other things that will impact our profitability in the fourth quarter. But we're comfortable with the long term, and we're pleased that we were able to raise both our revenue and earnings estimates this quarter.
Ron Nersesian: And John, just getting back to the second half of your question, I believe you asked about whether or not in China, there were other competitors that may gain from the trade wars. We don't see that obviously for other U.S. competitors. But for competitors out of Germany and out of Japan, they can get, let's just say a more consideration, but we're very comfortable with our overall differentiation, which will enable us to drive our growth throughout the world.
John Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks, guys. That's very helpful.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Good afternoon.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, a question for you is, when you sort of looking out to fiscal 2020, to the extent you're willing, sort of given the Huawei loss and tougher comps kind of uncertain macro environment, would you still expect to be able to deliver top line growth organically above your 4% to 5% long-term range? Any color you can help us out with this, as we sort of build our models for next year?
Ron Nersesian: I'm going to let Neil take this. Obviously, we only guide one quarter out, but Neil will be able to give you a little bit of color.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Obviously, Brandon, it's a little bit of a difficult question, given some of the macro uncertainty that exists today. I think what we would focus on is that we're very confident in the strength and differentiation that exists in our portfolio and we're very confident in our ability to outgrow the market and our competitors regardless of what set of economic circumstances take place. I think we still see strong secular trends in some of these big growth areas. As we talked about, the 5G ramp is accelerating and China is kind of leading that today, but we expect other countries will soon follow. Auto is the other one that obviously where we would see – expect to see a little bit of an arms race going on, as folks across the globe will look to get out with the EV and increased levels of autonomous vehicles out into the marketplace. We'd also expect aerospace defense to have a good year next year. So, as you know, we operate in a diverse set of end markets, both from a market standpoint, from a geographical standpoint, with the broadest portfolio in the industry, which is very well-positioned and so we're pretty confident going into next year.
John Pitzer: Thanks. And then just one follow up on the Prisma acquisition. Can you quantify the revenue base for that asset? Kind of what your pipeline looks like for other deals right now and exactly what whole Prisma feels that in terms of capabilities that you didn't have in-house already? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks. Why don't I take the first part of that and I'll let Satish talk? It's a small acquisition. It's substantially less than 2% of company revenue. We have a strong – as always, we have a strong funnel development process, but I think we set a high bar in terms of the types of assets that we're looking to bring into Keysight in the types of returns that we – that we like to grapple. We're always looking to reinvest, to drive growth and value expansion for our investors.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thank you. As you know, a big part of our success and expansion in 5G has been in the software layers of test where we have made this a strategic priority. And we've made some acquisitions of Anite and continue to invest for the position we have. We believe we have a leadership position here. But having said that, as 5G evolves, we see opportunities in new areas, like with RAN disaggregating and virtualization, and other areas where our collaboration with customers has been very close. And as you saw from the press release that we had with Nokia as an example. To continue to build on this trend, we're always looking for great talent, teams with credibility, and Prisma Telecom Testing has had over two decades of experience, specifically focused on helping base station designers overcome the software layers challenges. And it's a great team and a great add, and while the revenue today is a smaller fraction of Keysight, I know it will add and strengthen our 5G platform and build on the runway we currently have.
Ron Nersesian: And Brandon, this is Ron. A good way to think about Prisma is very similar to Anite, where it has capability to help us move forward in the software layers to leverage our overall 5G and communication solutions. And as far as utilization of our cash with regards to other M&A, as you can see, we're generating very strong free cash flow. We have $1.4 billion of cash right now. But if you take a look at our return on invested capital over the last 12 months, it's been roughly 26%. So, we have a high threshold. As Neil had mentioned, as far as our utilization of cash and we're going to make sure that anything we buy will always generate an ROIC above our WACC. And we've done about nine acquisitions and eight of them are in really good shape. And one of them we've got about halfway there.
Brandon Couillard: Very good. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Adam.
Adam Thalhimer: I also wanted to ask about fiscal 2020 and particularly on the margin front. Just curious if there's any reason the margins that you put up in Q2, Q3, and then you're guiding to for Q4, I mean, are those sustainable for next year? Maybe you can just walk us through puts and takes there.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I mean, I'd focus – start on the gross margin line. We did talk about in the second quarter having some really favorable mix that kind of drove that to be rounding to 64%. I think we're comfortable in the 63% range as we look out over foreseeable horizon. Moving down through the P&L, continue to see a tremendous amount of demand for research and development activities coming from our customers. So, if anything I see upward pressure on the R&D line, particularly relative to the past couple of quarters, right. We're running close to 16% year-to-date, but we're close to the 15% for the last two quarters and so. You could see that trending back up toward 16% next year, given some of the demand that we see in the marketplace. But overall, we feel like we're very well positioned and are pleased with both the profit and cash flow that we've been generating.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then just a second question for me. In 5G, feels like we're still awfully early in kind of development stage of 5G, is that correct? Or how are you guys viewing that at this point?
Ron Nersesian: We are early. And 5G development continues for a while even if after manufacturing starts. We also mentioned that we do have some manufacturing solutions, but we're very selective there. We're only going to go after opportunities that give us very good returns. But we see a decade long evolution, at least in this 5G market and we're very happy with where we're at. I'll let Satish also make a couple of comments.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, we agree. I think with 5G, obviously, the first used case is the enhanced mobile broadband of the smartphone used case and that's playing out. And even there, we're still very early days, with the first device is just being announced. So, that will play out over next few years. And then we believe with Release 16, a new use case is coming online, the runway is there. And obviously, for Keysight having being with all the leading vendors, very early on in their design phase, continues to give us the strategic advantage. The other point I want to highlight is we've always believed in this thesis and we've talked about it, that 5G because of the technology changes, the presence and upgrade cycle for testing – design and testing, you can start to see that in our numbers and you're starting to hear that on other conference calls as well.
Adam Thalhimer: That's great. Okay. Thanks a lot.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. And I will ask both my questions at the same time, so you can sort out about answering the order of them. But on 5G, I believe a previous person asked, what was the order rate for 5G. And I can't remember if you actually said the percent, or if you just kind of talked in generalities. And with the 5G orders versus 4G orders, since a lot of hardware can be upgradable via software, base stations can be upgraded that are 4G into 5G via software, is it the same true about a tester? Can a tester be upgraded from 4G to 5G, or needs a completely new tester? So, just kind of a little bit more on the 5G orders and testers. And then my second question is on the acquisition you mentioned. Can you explain exactly kind of what they do and how magnitude wise, they fit into your sales outlook for this year? Are they meaningfully contributing in sales this year? And what about a full run rate, and why this acquisition should make sense, as compared to say, Ixia, which has had some challenges?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Okay. Well, thank you. I think the first thing is our – our 5G momentum continues, as we have said before. Our commercial communications, you can look at the – the segment growth rates have been double digit as Ron has mentioned. And we continue to do well across the – across the entire ecosystem in 5G and it's still very early days. With regard to the upgrade question that you had, for most of the test tools that we are talking about, 5G represents a complete change, higher frequencies, wider bandwidth, which means the physical equipment is different. And then even in the protocol stack, the diversity between the non-stand-alone and stand-alone that we talked about also represents a pretty big opportunity for us, not only for a test equipment replacement, but also a continuous software mix changes and you'll start to see our – that reflected in our margin profile as software becomes a bigger part of our business. So, that's the other piece. With regard to Prisma, we're very pleased with the acquisition because we have been engaging very closely with a number of the base stations and small cell equipment designers, especially in the software layers of test and Prisma brings the expertise and the installed base with that customer set that allows us to build on the strength of our 5G platform. And I'll let Neil make some comments on the materiality of Prisma.
Neil Dougherty: Let me do that. So Prisma, as I said is substantially less than 2% of revenue, think of it as closer to 1%. We're obviously baking into our forecast that level of revenue. So, it's a relatively small impact. It's a profitable business. But we're excited for what they bring both in terms of the talent of the people that we brought onboard and being able to bring on a technology that's additive to our 5G portfolio.
Mark Wallace: And Jim, this is Mark. I just want to add one thing to the 5G discussion. And that is that we're seeing a strong demand and growth for our services. As a part of this business and overall, we saw double-digit order growth in services in Q3. And if you think about the expansive nature of these solutions and the complexity associated with them, we're selling more and more professional services. And now that we're into the second and soon to be the third year of deploying some of these network equipment emulation solutions, I'm really excited to see some of the opportunities grow for us to sell continuing services to help our customers to be successful.
Jim Suva: Thank you. That's all very useful, and your additional commentary was greatly appreciated. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Jim.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes. Good afternoon. And thank you for the questions and very nice quarter.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Richard Eastman: Ron, could we just speak for just a second or two, we're talking about Huawei and trying to get our arms around the situation kind of going forward, what has changed here? Is the fact that we're able to ship more. Is this part of the licensing process, or is this a definitional adjustment as to what's characterized to be affected by the restricted list? Because again, the Commerce Department just put out 44 new Huawei entities that were just added to the restricted list. And I'm trying to maybe figure out a little bit of what's changed here on a go-forward basis, because you seem to be including Huawei orders in your order growth rate. So, presumably, there is an assumption that you'll be able to ship those in 12 months. Good luck there, but...
Ron Nersesian: Sure. I'll just say this. With regard to understanding what products we can ship and where they are, that was a moving target and it changed a couple of times. And we've sorted that out and we're very confident in what – not only what we did do, but in what we believe we can do if the regulations stay as they are. The new list that was just put out mentioning new entities, we've also looked at that and that's also in our guidance. So, I'll let Mark talk about that.
Mark Wallace: Yes, Rick. It's a fluid situation. It's changing, as you just pointed out, most recently in the last few days. So, we're focusing on this. We're complying fully with all of the export regulations. And as we pointed out in following those, we were able to ship some products and some more products than we originally had thought when we guided Q3. But I don't want to lose sight of the broader China situation. We have a very strong and broad business in China. And it's a very important market for us. The prior headwinds beyond the export control issues with semiconductor and some of the RPL customers that we've been talking about for a year now, they still remain and yet we had very strong double-digit order growth in the quarter in 5G, in automotive, in aerospace defense, in the broad industries, in semiconductor. And so, we've got a very strong position there. Matter of fact, when you exclude Huawei during Q3, we still deliver double-digit order growth for the quarter. So, yes, Huawei is built into our assumptions. We're looking at it very closely, but there is a broader story there that's very strong.
Richard Eastman: Can I just – just a follow-up on that particular point. Have you started shipping infrastructure, kind of manufacturing test? You are kind of moving down that to the value chain there from R&D, which obviously is probably held up, but have you started shipping any manufacturing – infrastructure manufacturing test equipment?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. For – in the broader sense, it is still very early days for manufacturing at the 5G ecosystem level, but our solutions have gained a good penetration with all the major players.
Ron Nersesian: The volume is not high. It's more or less prototype lines and an early start. So, we haven't come close to near the curve there of what we expect to see.
Richard Eastman: And then just the last question. A follow-up for Neil. Around the CSG business, the margins have just been fantastic year-to-date, both gross and operating margin. The incrementals coming in, might just well be 100%. Is that the influence of software in CSG? In other words, somewhat sustainable at these levels going forward?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We definitely are seeing as part of our 5G portfolio a significantly higher software content than in prior generations. You took the words out of my mouth. If you're going to point to a single driver, that is the biggest driver of the margin improvement. You coupled that with the fact that we have a highly differentiated portfolio and an early lead to see the advantage of being a first mover in the marketplace, but certainly, that the software – the software component or the software portion of 5G is higher. And we do believe this is sustainable over time.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Ron Nersesian: And I'll just add that our software growth, we don't report this all the time, was well over 20%.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Yun from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Yun: Hi guys. Great quarter. My question is on your China business. Can you expand on sort of your competitive moat in the region, as well as give us an update on domestic or global competitors? Are you seeing any increasing competitive efforts from peers, especially given sort of ongoing macro trade concerns?
Mark Wallace: Yes, Brian. This is Mark. I'll take that. So, there's a lot of competitors in China, and we are continuing to focus on delivering value as we've just been speaking about. So, when it comes to the highly differentiated solutions and our global connection across these ecosystems, we have a very clear differentiation. So, I think we're winning a lot of that business. There is some lower-end commoditized business, including some companies that are based in China, that we're seeing an increased activity level as you might imagine because of the trade situation. And with the ongoing growth of all the industries that we've talked about in China, there is always going to be competition. We take that competition very seriously. But we're going to continue to focus on our strengths and differentiating at being first to market with the products that we're bringing to our customers. And then globally, it's kind of hard to tell. It's hard to speak to that in a general sense. But I think, again, what we're doing today with our focus on solutions and being first to our – first to market with customer solutions is a differentiator that we're driving across all the regions and we continue to be very successful.
Brian Yun: Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Alright. Very good. Thank you, Rob. And we thank you all for your time and joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming conferences. And that concludes our call. So, thank you and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2019 Q2  (2019-05-29 16:30:00) =====

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding second quarter with both record revenue and record earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance and very strong free cash flow. Our continued focus on our winning strategy and commitment to operational excellence under the Keysight leadership model are delivering strong results for the company. Today I'll focus my formal comments on four key headlines for the quarter: First, Keysight delivered another record quarter and exceptional results. Revenue was well above our guidance and grew 9% or 12% on a core basis to surpass $1 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter and to reach a new high. We also achieved record gross margin, record operating margin and record earnings. We grew earnings 47% to reach $1.22 per share, which was well above our guidance. And we generated strong free cash flow of $192 million. Second, we are complying with the recently announced United States Department of Commerce export control regulations with regard to China and Huawei. Outside of China, we continue to see broad-based momentum across multiple end markets. Customers continue to make R&D investments in next-generation technologies, which helped fuel growth in Q2 and we expect will drive Keysight's growth to between 7% and 8% for the fiscal year 2019. Third, we are significantly ahead of our plan on the margin expansion and earnings objectives that we outlined last year at our Investor Day in March of 2018. We now expect that we will achieve the gross margin and EPS targets outlined for fiscal year 2021 in this year fiscal 2019. This is two years ahead of plan. We remain focused on operational excellence as defined by our Keysight Leadership Model or KLM. This discipline is driving margin expansion and translating into strong earnings growth and cash flow as demonstrated by our results and provides model durability even as macro conditions change. And fourth, as we announced today in our earnings release, Keysight's Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $500 million of common stock. The new repurchase program is effective immediately and replaces the previously authorized $350 million program, of which $160 million were remaining. The expanded repurchase authorization demonstrates our confidence in Keysight's business and our continued commitment to return capital to our shareholders. Now let's take a look deeper look into our performance for the second quarter. We achieved $1.22 per share in earnings, which was $0.23 above the high end of our guidance. We delivered 47% earnings growth for the quarter and 60% earnings growth in the first half of the year. We also delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 14% in total and 16% on a core basis to exceed $1 billion. As a reminder, our core metrics exclude the impact of currency movements and revenue from acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months. Revenue grew 9% or 12% on a core basis to reach $1.093 billion, a new record for Keysight. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of delivering over $1 billion in both orders and revenue. Our strategy to consistently invest in leading-edge technologies in areas of the market undergoing multi-year transformations while also focusing on operational discipline is delivering top and bottom-line results. Over the past 10 quarters, we have generated growth across multiple dimensions of the business as a result of our targeted investments. Expanding our portfolio of software solutions to help customers accelerate their designs is a key component of our strategic vision. During the quarter, revenue for our software solutions continued to grow double-digits and faster than our overall growth rate. Our innovations in software provide Keysight with a very strong competitive advantage which we believe will continue to benefit the company for many years ahead. Increased software sales and our focus on R&D solutions and operational excellence are all helping us generate higher corporate gross margin. We have improved our gross margin by over 500 basis points in the first half of 2019 when compared to the same period just three years ago. And we're ahead of schedule on our margin expansion plan for this year. Moving to our markets, we continue to see customers across the board invest in the R&D of next-generation technologies which fueled our growth in Q2. In 5G, we achieved another record quarter of orders. The entire mobile communications ecosystem is now investing in solutions to support the early ramp of commercial 5G networks and devices. Our first-to-market innovations and engagement with leading-edge market makers across the wireless R&D ecosystem continue to strengthen our position in this fast-growing market. We had a great showing again at Mobile World Congress this past quarter. Our solutions enabled over 15 industry-leading customers to demonstrate their innovations at the show which highlights the greater role we are playing. We continue to build on our 5G collaborations with many industry leaders. This quarter, we continued our partnership with Qualcomm to establish the industry's first 5G New Radio connection in frequency division duplexing mode. While we have been diligently investing and innovating with our 5G customers and partners for a number of years, the industry is still in the very early stages of realizing the transformative potential of 5G technology. Commercialization to 5G networks around the world will usher in a new era of bandwidth and high-speed connectivity with a massive improvement in many network attributes such as data rates, coverage, and reliability. Achieving this multifaceted improvement requires transformation of the entire communications stack end-to-end. Keysight is uniquely positioned to address the entire network transformation from wireless to wired to the cloud. Our solutions cover the entire communications workflow in both the physical and upper layers of the network. As 5G drives investment end-to-end, we're also seeing customers invest in the Internet infrastructure R&D in advance of 5G. In Q2, we captured R&D investment in next-generation electrical and optical tests for speeds of 400G and beyond, including key new design wins with several network and data center customers. Our leadership position in 400G at the physical layer creates valuable opportunities at the protocol layers where customers' R&D investments follow over time. The industry-leading 400 gigabit Ethernet solutions delivered by our Ixia Solutions Group addresses these opportunities. The automotive and energy market is another area where we continue to make great strides. In Q2, we continued to see strong R&D investments in autonomous driving, electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and connectivity even as sales for manufacturing-oriented solutions slowed during the quarter. Auto manufacturers and suppliers continue to invest in critical new capabilities for their future designs and our customers' engagements at Tier 1 accounts are deepening. We also saw a similar dynamic in the semiconductor market this quarter where we saw a solid revenue growth for our parametric test solutions. This growth was supported by early strategic investment in next-generation 5-nanometer process technology despite the expected softness in this market that we have seen for the past couple of quarters and continue to expect in the near-term. Looking ahead, we believe we are well positioned to continue to build on our strength, expand our leadership and take advantage of our opportunities we see in the market. We have a differentiated portfolio of solutions across a diverse and broad set of end markets. We continue to closely monitor the trade situation with China and the macro environment. As reflected in our Q3 revenue guidance, we are not immune to these events. However, next-generation R&D investment has remained strong and we have deep engagements with industry-leading customers around the globe. Our strategy to focus on bringing solutions to market that help customers accelerate innovation, sets Keysight apart from the competition and is driving our success. In summary, we delivered an outstanding second quarter, in addition to achieving strong revenue growth. With our commitments to operational excellence, we are driving strong earnings growth and cash flow, while investing in key areas of the business. We will continue to focus our investments to foster innovation, create value for our customers and outgrow the market. Now, I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business, while maintaining focus on operational excellence. For the second quarter of 2019, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1.093 billion, which was well above the high-end of our guidance range and grew 12% on a core basis. This brings our revenue growth for the first half of the year to 13% or 15% core growth. Our better-than-expected Q2 results were driven by continued strong demand especially in 5G where we have a leading position as well as superior execution by the entire Keysight team. I will also highlight that in Q2 orders for services grew double digits. Services demand was broad based and we saw good adoption of our new support offering, such as Keysight Care. Total Keysight orders exceeded revenue once again this quarter. We delivered $1.121 billion in orders in Q2. Orders were up 14% in total and 16% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q2. We reported record gross margin of 64%. This represents our second consecutive quarter of delivering record gross margin. As Ron mentioned, our growing contribution of software revenue is helping increase our overall gross margin profile to a new level. We also delivered record operating margin and earnings. We achieved 25% operating margin and net income of $233 million. On a per share basis, we delivered $1.22 in earnings, which was well above the high-end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $676 million, up 8% while delivering record gross margin of 63.4% and operating margin of 28%. In Q2, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $431 million driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center-related next-generation 400 Gigabit Ethernet and higher digital tests. In our Commercial Communications end market, the strong software content in our solutions is enabling our improved gross margin performance. Aerospace, defense and government generated revenue of $245 million a core decline of 1% on a high year-over-year compare. During the quarter, we saw steady spending in the U.S., which was offset by softness in some international markets. However, we have a very healthy overall funnel for this end market. EISG generated second quarter revenue of $299 million, up 6% driven by strength in automotive, general electronics and next-generation parametric tests. EISG reported record gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 26%. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $118 million, up 32% over last year's soft compare of $90 million. ISG sales were driven by strong application and security sales along with large visibility renewals, which were recognized ratably over the course of the year. ISG reported gross margin of 71.5% and 3% operating margin, which does not include the full benefit of the approximately $50 million in annualized cost synergies we generated from the transaction, of which about 70% are being realized within CSG and EISG. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $221 million and free cash flow of $192 million or 18% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the first half of the year to $401 million, or 19% of revenue and 98% of non-GAAP net income. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, during the quarter we acquired approximately 344,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $87.21 for a total consideration of $30 million. As Ron mentioned, yesterday Keysight's Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million of common stock. The new repurchase program is effective immediately and replaces the previously authorized $350 million program of which $160 million was remaining. Before moving to our outlook, I would like to make a few comments regarding the recently announced United States Department of Commerce export control regulations. These regulations directly impact one of our larger customers in China that contributed approximately 2.5% of revenue in the second half of FY 2018. Our business with this customer and other leading 5G customers has continued to expand driven by the acceleration of 5G timelines and the strength and breadth of our 5G solutions. As a result this customer represented almost 5% of Keysight revenue in the first half of 2019 of which we believe roughly 2% was pulled forward due to the U.S.-China trade situation. The new trade restrictions will create a headwind of revenue growth starting in Q3. Despite this headwind we expect to deliver between 7% and 8% revenue growth for the year along with strong profitability. Now turning to our outlook and guidance, we expect third quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $1.020 billion to $1.060 billion. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.97 to $1.05 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. With that I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Christine will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, thanks. Hey Ron, Neil.
Neil Dougherty: Hi Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath: So please double-click on your China exposure Ron and Neil please chime in. I would like to better understand the dynamics playing inside of China and then ex-China I want to get your sense on your 5G business in particular any slowdown you anticipate outside of China potentially because of the Huawei kind of the whiplash effect? Thanks 
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Vijay. I'll make a general comment then I'll pass it over to Neil to talk about the China implications and then I'll let Satish say a couple of things about our overall very strong 5G business. So with regards to China and Huawei in particular we are complying with all U.S. regulations and monitoring and assessing the situation as it evolves. There are certain circumstances during this next 90 days or this 90-day period where we can ship some products to Huawei, but we obviously have other backlog and other business that we typically do get for them that we will not be able to ship. Outside of this regulation our business is firing on all cylinders and we continue to grow and that's why we have guided $1.01 for Q4 in the middle of our range -- for Q3 which is in the middle of our range, despite taking into account all of these effects.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Vijay if you look specifically at the Huawei impact for Q3 we've reduced our revenue guide for next quarter by about $25 million as a result of the escalating trade situation in China. The impact in the fourth quarter is larger just based on the funnel of opportunities that we had which was more heavily weighted towards Q4 versus Q3 and in the second half of this year. I think to just to echo Ron's point, we'll have to have a bit of a reset for this customer situation that we're going to lose, but the underlying business continues to grow very, very strongly. We're very well positioned in a number of end markets that have -- that are just at the front end of the ramp in terms of automotive and 5G with a strong funnel of opportunities in aerospace defense that we talked about and so we continue to be very optimistic about how Keysight is positioned as we look forward.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Hi, Vijay. At the onset I want to start by saying on a global basis despite the recent events we continue to see momentum on the 5G trajectory both for our solutions and the entire ecosystem that's scaling. In the most recent quarter all our regions -- all the four regions showed strong year-over-year growth. We've added 100 new customers in the first half into our 5G platform relative to the previous half. And we continue to see some notable highlights in the most recent quarter which illustrates my point. First, we saw component supply chain enter into 5G and based on the strength of our modular platform. Second the NEMs who have been declaring public contracts have actually been investing in ramping up capacity for base stations which is a positive. And third as 5G scales and deployment scenarios are being played out, the complexity as we've talked about has been high and we've recorded design wins for our deployment tools. Again very early stages, but hopefully paints the runway that we have moving forward.
Ron Nersesian: I'll just add one other comment. As Satish had mentioned all of our regions grew triple-digits in 5G and overall, we were very strongly into triple-digits.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, perfect. It's great to hear this level of transparency into your business. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: You're welcome.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Hi Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: A question for Satish on the same topic. As you kind of look out to March of next year and sort of the finalization of the timeline for 5G standards, what impact do you think the Huawei situation might have? And if that is delayed to all how much of an impact do you think that has on sort of your business and sort of the ecosystem?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. There's a lot of possible scenarios that can play out, but I would say if you look at the top drivers that we look at is the number of operators that are actually committing and are deploying 5G. Currently that stands at 20 and it's increasing. If you look at the number of network equipment contracts that people have declared publicly that's been increasing throughout the year. If you look at the number 5G devices that are being put out, it's about 30. So, those are things that we look at to say is the industry dynamic strong and it continues to be strong and healthy. If you look at the standards, I think you point out that the 5G standards are maturing and that's good for Release 15 of the spec. We're actually leading in the - from a global conformance validation perspective in enabling the industry to roll out the technology with interoperability as its core theme. So -- and with standards starting to work on Release 16, the innovation drivers, especially in R&D, continue to be strong and robust. And we see some reports that suggest that as share shifts occur, different players will continue to ramp investments and I think given the strength of our position over the last three years in 5G, we're well-positioned to capitalize under various scenarios.
Ron Nersesian: I'll just add two more comments with regards to 5G. First I will say that even if you were to take Huawei out of our orders, 5G still grew 198% in the quarter. The second point that I'll add is 5G relative to legacy cellular technologies, our 5G orders have surpassed all of our legacy cellular technologies for the second quarter in a row. So, we have a very high growth component from 5G that is now larger on a dollar basis which will carry a higher weighted average impact to our overall average growth rate.
Brandon Couillard: Thank you. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color. Maybe a question for Neil just on the incrementals in the second quarter, pretty remarkable especially in CSG, I think incrementals over 100%. Can you sort of speak to where all that margin is coming from and perhaps the impact of yields greater software mix on the gross margin line? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, Brandon thanks for the question. I think there's a number of things. Obviously, at Keysight, we are consistently focused on operational excellence and driving improved profitability across the entire platform. I think in Q2 we did see a very favorable mix in our revenue during the quarter, both from software which grew faster than the overall rate of growth of the total business as well as some very favorable mix in some of our solutions platforms that were added into gross margins. So, we put up two consecutive quarters now of record gross margins with Q2 being close to 200 basis point improvement and over the prior record. I think as we look forward we're very encouraged by the gross margin profile that we see. It's not quite as strong as what we saw here in the second quarter, but we're very encouraged by the gross margin profile that we have which is driven by the solutions approach that we're taking to the market.
Brandon Couillard: Super. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi Investments. Your line is open.
Jim Suva: Thank you. You've been very clear and transparent which is appreciated on the Huawei challenges given the trade war tensions and tariffs and such. However, what I'd like to do is increase the scope a little bit. If my memory is correct, I believe, China is closer to like an 18% of your total sales. Do these new tariffs impact that or the customer behavior or any other potential customers indirectly? Because I know that the supply chain is very complex, but again, you spoke about Huawei and I think all the questions are answered there. But anything about broader China and these tariffs we should be aware of that you're working on or keep an eye-on on your dashboard? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, hi, this is Ron. China is about 17% to 18% of our total business. We have looked at the indirect China impact on what is going on talking with our sales organization on a daily basis all of that has been included in the guide. Things can change in the future, but we're doing things such as redeploying our sales force from an account that can't sell on into other areas. On top of that Mark Wallace is also expanding the sales force and I'll let him give you a little bit of an update on that which will drive our growth.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks Ron. Hi Jim. So, yes, that's very true. In all of our regions, we're expanding our sales force on course to doubling the number of front-line sellers, so we're well on course to doing that. You heard me talk about that at the Investor Day last year. In China, the same thing is happening. We're continuing to deploy resources and we are a very resilient, especially in China to be able to redeploy resources dynamically as opportunities change. So we're doing that as we speak. I do want to point out though in Q2 with the prior headwinds that we had for semiconductors and some of the RPL companies, we still had record revenue in Q2. So there is still a lot of great business in growth. The broader business in China is holding up reasonably well. As we mentioned, we have a broad portfolio of solutions and a lot of diverse end markets including 5G, including automotive and general electronics. So the combination of our ability to cover these customers, redeploy dynamically and bring the total solution set that we've been doing to market is a formula for success.
Jim Suva: Thank you so much for the clarification. It’s greatly appreciated.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. And congrats on a very strong quarter. I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about the competitive landscape in 5G specifically. Very much appreciate you guys have a great lead over your competition, but at the margin it does feel like your two competitors in particular are trying to play catch-up here. If you can point to some of the differentiating factors that separate you guys from the rest of the pack that would be helpful? Then I have a follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Hi. This is Ron. And I will turn it over to Satish in one minute. Obviously, if you look at the growth rates of the other – of the competitors you can see how they're doing. We don't comment specifically on our competitors, but we will tell you a little bit about our strengths. And I'll let Satish fill in some of the holes.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. Thanks, Ron. I'd say that, the first reason why customers buy from us is the experience that we've gained over the last three years working on 5G. This has been an imperative since the company was formed that Ron has laid out and we're continued to execute, but execute not just on our internal programs, but with our customers. The second reason, we feel good about our runway is because of the – our expansion into the software layers of test, which has gone on well. We've had 31 collaborations just this year that, we've announced with industry partners, which continues to build on some of the collaborations we've had, but also new customers who are entering our platform. And then third, it's all about the end-to-end equation. You hear about these as terms and jargons, but for us it means we cover the whole ecosystem with life cycle solutions. The only reason, we can do that is we have capabilities all the way from Anite to Ixia now that are providing us considerable insights and abilities to be able to execute to key milestones of our customers. So that's in short, our value proposition here.
Toshiya Hari: Great. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up, I had a question on margins and I guess this will be for Neil. Really encouraging to hear that you guys are pulling in your margin targets by two years, if you look back, what are some of the things that drove the upside to margins? Was it primarily better revenue and perhaps stronger service mix and maybe high-value add products from 5G? Is there anything that I'm missing there? And then more importantly, going forward, how are you guys thinking about gross margin as well as operating margin? Is it more about revenue growth going forward or is there opportunity to expand margins further? Thank you.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. I think you hit most of the items. Obviously, we continue to see our software business outpace the overall growth of Keysight in total. And over the past couple of years that growth has been significantly above our long-term model. And as we've talked about, we have a great ability to drive leverage – profit leverage from growth. I think, if I were to step back big picture and say what's driving our improved gross margins, it's the fact that, we have changed our approach to go-to-market to one that's focused on end industries, and industry segments and bringing complete high-value solutions into the marketplace. And those differentiated solutions are enabling us to increase the gross margins. The other thing that we've talked about repeatedly is our kind of decade long at this point or more than decade-long effort to migrate more of our solution selling into our customers R&D labs, and really target the areas of manufacturing that are higher margin opportunities. And so all of those things in concert are now starting to hit and they layer on top of one another and are starting to have a very measurable impact for the company.
Ron Nersesian: I'll just add a little bit more. We have really focused on operational excellence and we have a program that's in place across all 12,900 employees here at Keysight to improve operational excellence, which is part of our Keysight leadership model. But Neil has really hit the nail on the head. It's our differentiation, when our customers go ahead and they look at total solutions, which is not only the world's best hardware, but the best application and measurement IP and software as well as our services capability across a broad range of products, we bring solutions that cannot be brought to bear by many of our competitors. And this is giving us the ability to not only do a great job of selling our products, but to also capture this differentiated value.
Toshiya Hari: And then on the go-forward basis?
Neil Dougherty: Just what I said over the kind of intermediate term as we look into the second half of this year, the -- our gross margin strength and our funnel and then our backlog is strong, but it's not quite at the level of what we're seeing here in the second quarter. But we continue to see very strong gross margin as we talked about. We believe we've achieved and can sustain the FY '21 gross margin target that we outlined at Investor Day in March of last year.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Ron, can I just circle back for a minute or two around 5G in China and in particular Huawei, was there a significant kind of patent to the IP around 5G and the different dynamics there? Is there a sense that could Huawei look to other vendor’s non-U.S. vendors on the test side if this stays -- if this kind of restricted list kind of stays in place? And how does that restricted list, I mean this is different from the tariff resolution but how does that issue get resolved from your perspective? I mean maybe those are the two questions around Huawei and 5G?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. The first thing that I'll say is with regards to Huawei, if they cannot sell for instance into the U.S. and into some other countries that business will go somewhere else. And again they'll capture some of the business, but other business will go to players such as Samsung or Nokia or Ericsson and we're not here to predict which one will win, but all I can tell you is we've very strong positions in all of them. So some of that business can be displaced into some of their competitors. We do have a competitor in Japan and a competitor in Germany, Anritsu and Rohde & Schwarz but we have been significantly ahead of them and we believe we still will be very well positioned as we go forward in the future.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up question on Ixia maybe for Neil. Can you just -- great progress all over on margins here in the other segments, but could you just kind of maybe lay out some sort of a roadmap for Ixia's profitability? I mean is that due mainly to investment or is our single-digit operating profit at Ixia, does it move to double digit over the course of 18 months or 12 months or how do you see that unfolding here?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We definitely see an intermediate to longer-term opportunity. We have a pretty dramatic improvement in Ixia's profitability. I think we're continuing to wait for the 400-gig ramp to hit the Ixia portion of the business. We're seeing that pretty strongly right now in Satish's business on the physical air side, but we know that the protocol layer sides are going to lag. And so we'll look to the back half of this calendar year or early next calendar year for those to hit. Ultimately with the business that has 70-plus percent gross margins the best way to fix the bottom line is to get the business growing again. I do think it's worth noting from a profitability standpoint just reiterating the points that I made on -- in the prepared remarks we have generated $50 million of cost synergies in this business or as a result of this transaction, but 70% of those synergy value is actually being realized within our Communication Solutions business and Electronics Industrial Solutions business. And you can see that in their increased levels of profitability. And so you couple that with the variable pay impact of having -- that comes with our variable pay programs that are based on organic growth and operating margin we're paying out at historically high levels. And the Ixia picture is far better than maybe it would appear if you just look at our segment results.
Ron Nersesian: I would also add on top of that, we are investing in R&D at a higher percentage of revenue than has been done in long period of time, if not ever. And you couple that with the life cycle investment that we expect to see in some of their solutions and we feel like we have some real movement that will happen there.
Richard Eastman: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Rick
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Marchetti from Stifel. Your line is open.
John Marchetti: Thanks very much. I was wondering if maybe we can shift gears just a little bit and talk about the ADG group and that slowdown there this past quarter, it sounds like the U.S. remained relatively stable for you, but you did see drop off sales as well. Just curious how to think about some of the puts and takes there going forward as we look to the second half of this calendar year?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Thanks John. I will just say this we have a very, very full funnel right now. Obviously all of it has not been released but I'm going to let Mark Wallace tell you a little bit more about the details.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Okay. John thanks for the question. Q2 of 2019 was first of all tough compare. It's the second largest Q2 for orders since we formed as Keysight. So we had a decent quarter and as you pointed out the growth that we realized from the U.S. was coming both from the direct government and some of the contractors. The other thing that is not as visible all the time is that our services business as part of solving customer's problems within aerospace defense continues to grow and that's true around the world, and in particular we're hoping to optimize their equipment uptime and utilization. And I see a lot of runway here to complement our high-end equipment and solutions business. The other thing is there is pent-up demand in the U.S. in particular, because there are some continuing delays in funding and appropriation. While we saw some of that release in Q2, we'll be monitoring this very closely, obviously as we get closer to the end of the fiscal year for the U.S. government. And you know what 5G is everywhere. We're seeing 5G opportunities in aerospace defense as well we're seeing 5G opportunities in automotive. So our broader solution set as well as our footprint is applicable here in aerospace as well. So the longer-term outlook remains unchanged. We will see continued investment because of increased R&D spending for some of the advanced technologies that we have great solutions for.
John Marchetti: Thank you. And then maybe, Satish just a quick question for you on the broader outlook for 5G, I'm wondering, if you can comment at all on sort of sub-6 versus millimeter wave. Where you're seeing some of that activity? And if anything that's happened recently certainly impacts that or how you look at those two sort of competing versions of 5G developing going forward?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yeah. I think a good question. To start-off, I'd say clearly, the ecosystem is ramping and it's ramping sort of based on regional needs some parts of the world, starting to deploy sub-6 gig first, and some have started with millimeter wave and the densification play with 5G. The strength of our platform is that, we've designed it to be modular from grounds up. You start-off with sub-6 gigahertz add millimeter wave or you start-off with an SA, which is the stand-alone version and get to NSA and vice versa. Because of this sort of ability to move seamlessly between different implementations, we're able to service the global ecosystem which is why our 5G orders for this quarter ended on a record note and we continue to see that moment build out.
John Marchetti: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thanks, Christine, and we appreciate everyone joining us on the call today. To close this out, I'll turn it back to Ron for some final comments.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, everyone, for joining us. We really appreciate you staying with us and we really appreciated the chance to share these Q2 results with you. Obviously record Q2 orders for the highest Q2 in history, record revenue, record gross margin, record operating margin and record non-GAAP EPS makes us very happy. The other thing that was very impressive was our strong EPS growth at 47% in Q2 and 60% in the half and our $192 million of free cash flow, which was an 82% conversion. Also we're very glad that we were able to deliver to you a revenue and EPS significantly above the range. But what makes us even more excited is as we look forward, the margin expansion programs that we've been working on for years have paid off and they paid off early and we believe that will generate lots of cash for us as we look to the future and accordingly we have put in place a $500 million share buyback program, thanks to our Board of Directors. But we're very bullish on the future and on our growth initiatives going forward. Of course, you'll have a bump in the road here and there with some competitors but we are growing on so many different vectors, we look forward to reporting to you next quarter. Thank you very much and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high-end of our guidance and very strong free cash flow. Our continued focus on strategic execution and commitment to operational excellence are delivering strong results for Keysight. Today, I’ll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, it was a great start to the year and Keysight continued to deliver exceptional results. Revenue was well above our guidance and grew 18 %, or 20% on a core basis, to surpass $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. We grew earnings high double-digits and delivered $0.93 in EPS, which also exceeded our guidance. And, we generated a record $209 million in free cash flow, an increase of 42%year-over-year.  Second, customers continued to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight is at the forefront of several emerging technology trends. With our broad and differentiated portfolio of solutions, software and services, we are capturing a significant portion of the demand we see in the marketplace. And third, looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to build on our success and expand our leadership.  Given our strategic positioning in the key areas of the market, strong start to the year and outlook for Q2, we are confident in our revenue growth and earnings profile for the year. Now let’s take a deeper look into our performance for the first quarter. We achieved $0. 93 per share in earnings, which was $0.14 above the midpoint and $0.11 above the high-end of our guidance. We delivered 81% earnings growth for the quarter versus a low compare in the previous year. We also delivered record first quarter orders and strong order growth. Orders grew5% in total and 7 % on a core basis to exceed $1 billion. Revenue grew 18%, or 20 % on a core basis, and was also above $1 billion, which is a record for first quarter revenue. This represents our third consecutive quarter of delivering over $1 billion in both orders and revenue. Creating value for our customers by providing first-to-market solutions and insights that help them achieve innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and Keysight Leadership Model. Our targeted investments in the key areas of the market undergoing multi-year transformations are delivering results. We are generating broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business, and software is increasingly becoming a larger part of our portfolio. Revenue for our software solutions grew substantially higher than our overall growth rate in the first quarter to reach a new record. This growth was driven by demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonics application software. In the automotive and energy market, we continue to make great strides. Customer demand remained high in Q1, and we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. Auto manufacturers and suppliers have continued to invest in critical new capabilities, and are increasingly turning to Keysight as their strategic innovation partner.  As a result, we continue to grow our engagements within top customers and add new tier-1 accounts. In the quarter we announced collaboration with BMW Group to support its Battery Cell Competence Center in Munich. Keysight will equip their laboratories with battery test systems and provide services for effective laboratory workflow management and operation. In order to help our automotive customers accelerate innovation, we are committed to serving them in close proximity of their design hubs.  In January, we opened a new automotive customer center in Nagoya, Japan. Keysight has now opened four automotive customer centers aligned with each of the major global automotive customer ecosystems: Detroit, Michigan, in the U.S.; Boeblingen, Germany in Europe; and, Nagoya, Japan and Shanghai, China in Asia. In 5G, we achieved another record quarter of 5G orders and delivered strong double-digit growth in Q1. Network operators, NEMs, device-makers, and chipset companies are all investing for the early ramp of commercial 5G networks.  Our broad portfolio of 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen our position in this fast-growing market. Our pace of innovation and engagements has accelerated, and we continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter we received endorsements from SK Telecom, China Telecom, China Mobile and Softbank. Next week at Mobile World Congress, we will showcase our end-to-end 5G solutions and contributions. At the event, over a dozen leading innovators across the communications ecosystem will use Keysight’s solutions to demonstrate their 5G readiness.  This highlights the greater role we are playing in R&D and enabling customer innovation. We are also excited to collaborate with Xilinx, AT&T and others to accelerate Open RAN 5G network development through a rapid prototyping approach and open FPGA architecture. Together, at Mobile World Congress, we will demonstrate and test the industry’s first open radio access network 5G millimeter wave radio unit. Additionally, earlier today we announced our new scalable 5G User Equipment Emulation solution. It delivers end-to-end testing of 5G networks to ensure they can meet service level agreements for key 5G use cases, such as low-latency and high-reliability.  This solution expands the range of our 5G offerings into a previously unserved area for Keysight, which is the direct result of our acquisition of Ixia. Beyond 5G, our communications group also delivered strong growth in Network and Data Center solutions. This growth was driven by R&D investment in next-generation electrical and optical test for speeds of 400Gand higher, with key new product wins throughout the network and data center eco system. Our success with 400G at the physical layer creates valuable opportunities for our 400 gigabit Ethernet solutions at the protocol layers with Ixia, where customers’ R&D investments follow over time. Keysight’s solutions cover the entire customer workflow in both the physical and upper layers of the network.  Looking ahead, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to build on our success. Next-generation R&D investment has remained strong, and we are still in the early stages of these emerging technologies. Our focus on bringing solutions to market that help customers accelerate innovation is driving multiple avenues of growth. We have a differentiated portfolio of solutions across a diversified and broad set of end markets. For example, as we mentioned the past two quarters, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019.  Despite this dynamic, our breadth of offering and diverse set of end-markets has enabled us to offset this impact and deliver record orders in China during the quarter, with growth in multiple segments of that market. That said, we continue to closely monitor the macro environment in China, as well as other areas of our business. Before closing, I will highlight a few of the awards we recently received in acknowledgement of our corporate social responsibility, or CSR, efforts, which is one of the core values in our Keysight Leadership Model. First, Keysight was ranked among Barron’s 100 Most Sustainable Companies for the second year in a row. Additionally, we were named to Fortune’s 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity in 2018. CSR has always been a part of Keysight’s DNA and we are honored to be recognized forth is longstanding commitment to help sustain a better planet, strengthen communities, and create an inclusive work environment that fosters respect for individuals, their ideas and their contributions. In summary, we delivered an outstanding first quarter and the year is off to a great start for Keysight. In addition to driving strong revenue growth, we have maintained our focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to deliver earnings growth and strong cash flow while investing in key areas of the business. With our robust innovation engine, we have built a broad portfolio of solutions that span multiple segments, and software is becoming a larger part of our differentiation and business. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market.  Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. Additionally, when viewing our first quarter year-over-year operational compares, please keep in mind that last year’s first quarter results were negatively impacted by the closure of our Santa Rosa facility due to the 2017 wild fires. As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continued to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business, while maintaining focus on operational excellence. For the first quarter of 2019, we delivered non-GAAP revenue of $1,009 million, which was well above our guidance of $965million to $985 million, and grew 20% ton a core basis versus a soft compare. Our better than expected results were driven by continued strong demand and execution. Orders exceeded revenue once again this quarter. We delivered $1,016 million in orders in Q1. Orders were up 5% in total, and 7% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency movements and two small divestitures completed within the last year.  Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported record gross margin of 62% and operating expenses of $420 million, resulting in operating margin of 20%. We also achieved net income of $176million and delivered $0.93 in earnings per share, which was above our guidance of $0.76 to $0.82 per share. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 190 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, as Jason mentioned, we made a change to our reporting segments and now results from services, which was previously in our Services Solutions Group are reported in the segment in which the services are delivered. That said I will highlight that in Q1, orders for services grew double-digits. Our Communications Solutions Group generated total revenue of $623 million, up 25%, while delivering record gross margin of 61.1% and operating margin of 22%.  In Q1, Commercial Communications delivered double-digit order growth and revenue of $400 million, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center related next-generation 400 gigabit Ethernet and higher digital test. Aerospace, defense and government grew 3% and generated revenue of $223 million. Aerospace defense and government growth was driven by continued demand in space and satellite applications in the U.S., while spending in some international regions slowed. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $257 million, up 13%, driven by strength in automotive and emerging IoT applications, while the semiconductor market moderated as expected.  EISG reported gross margin of 58.9% and operating margin of 21%. Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q1 revenue of $129 million, which was slightly above last year’s revenue of $127 million, driven by network visibility solutions, while test revenue remained inline with last year. ISG reported gross margin of 71.3%and 9%operating margin. We were encouraged to see the improved sequential execution in ISG, and the vast majority of the contract manufacturing transition issues that we highlighted last quarter are now resolved. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our first quarter with $1.1billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported record cash flow from operations of $240 million and free cash flow of $209 million, or 21%of revenue.  Under our existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter we acquired approximately 686,000 shares on the open market, at an average price of $58.28 for a total consideration of $40 million. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $1,060 million to $1,080 million. For the first half of 2019, the midpoint of our guidance reflects 12 % revenue growth or 14 % on a core basis. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.93 to $0.99, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191million shares. The midpoint of this guidance reflects approximately 41% earnings growth for the first half of 2019.  For 2019 modeling purposes, recall that the quarterly revenue seasonality in 2018 was atypical due to the impact of the October 2017 northern California wild fires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits and our Q2 guidance reflects the upper end of this range. Additionally, we normally see a small sequential decline from Q2 to Q3, with Q4 being our strongest quarter of the year. I will also note that in Q1, the ASU 2017-07 pension accounting change went into effect. Under this new standard, a previous credit functionalized within operating income is now reported in other income.  For 2019, the impact of this change is projected to shift a credit of approximately $10 million per quarter from above the operating margin line to below. A retrospective of our historical results reflecting the new standard can be found on our website. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Kenzie, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer : Yes, good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Ron maybe the first question for you just on the 5G market and how it evolves over time. I think one of the investor concerns out there is that you are levered early to deployment of prototype 5G, but perhaps not as levered as you get to broader deployment of 5G. I'm wondering if you can help us understand how you think the market is going to evolve for 5G for you and as you answer the question can you talk a little bit about your share from 4G to5G and kind of what you've done to augment your TAM from 4G to 5G?
Ron Nersesian: Sure, thank you very much, John. Well, a couple of comments. The first thing is that we are --we have invested up and down the overall workflow for 5G. So we have solutions that exist in our EDA software early on when people are developing their designs, solutions for validation and verification not only of the hardware but now we have it a habit for the software that is done in R&D. We do have solutions too for manufacturing although that is not the main focus and then at the end of the lifecycle once things go into operations that's where Ixia plays in. So with our Ixia acquisition that bolsters up our overall solutions for the workflow along Anite Solutions that we have earlier in R&D. There is no doubt that our share is much higher than it was in 4G. In 4G, we did not have the funds to invest as heavily as we needed to in order to win in the protocol space. Clearly, as you look at the network space, as well as in many other sub areas. In 5G, we made this decision back in 2013 before we even went public. As soon as we announced the split we decided to go all in for 5G. So you will see that and see dramatic share gains between 5G versus where we are in 4G. I will let Satish also add a couple more --a couple more comments with regards to the overall 5G workflow.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, thank you, Ron. Just maybe a few points a strong 5G quarter for us extending our lead on the double-digit, triple digit growth that way of experiencing to 13th consecutive quarter. And when I look at the distribution of orders very pleased that we're seeing success across the ecosystem chipset companies, device companies, network equipment manufacturers, operators. And for the first time test labs even that are starting to invest in early 5G. And then when you look at the global spread, all regions participated in this reflecting the strength of our solution portfolio. There are no doubt the early R&D investments, some of them in the prototyping phase played itself out up to now, but if I reflect on this industry and look at the state of what's coming next, it's that --it's a scaling and it's still early days, but it's scaling for commercialization that's going to play out. And operator's interest is speaking as they vie to establish network leadership. And that's what's playing out and Ron referenced a few key design wins we had with lead operators in all regions in his narrative. But I would just want to end by saying it's still early days for the technology. We see that at scale the technology becomes relevant for consumers by at 2022 timeframe, plenty of innovation yet to come both from a standards point of view and from prioritization point of view. And from our plans, just this year we have a number of solutions that we will be launching. We just announced as a matter of fact the solution working closely with our Ixia Solutions Group just today.  So number of solutions that will launch this year and we're also planning for more as the industry scales. Thank you.
John Pitzer : That's helpful guys. And then for me my follow-up for Neil. Neil you highlighted that you guys are rightfully investing to leverage kind of your IP to drive higher growth. I'm just kind of curious as to where you think you are in the investment cycle for the company and how we should think about kind of operating margin targets over a multiyear period?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So we continue to see a very high level of demand for continued innovation investment across multiple platforms within Keysight. As we've talked about, we've talked about driving a 400 basis point improvement on our operating margins from 2017 levels. So I've got to get us into the 22% -23% operating margin ranges by 2021. And so we remain focused on that. You'll see as we look to achieve that we're really not looking to get leverage on the R&D line because of exactly what I've talked about the demand that we're seeing for customers for continued development were from Keysight. But you'll continue to see gross margin improvement from us as well as leveraging our general administrative functions to drive increased profitability over that horizon.
Ron Nersesian: John I'll just add that we --I'll just add that we continue to pick up new customers. We announced four more customers for instance today four large customers and we continue to go ahead and see our business delivered double double-digit growth.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Great, thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Can you guys talk a little bit about 4G? What you're seeing from a customer activity perspective? How strong or weak that business has been over the past couple of quarters? And how should we think about sustainability in that business relative to 5G?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Satish feel to fill in.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I will do, Ron. So as we have talked about before with 5G there's the --there's a non standalone version which requires a lot of the 4G capabilities. So there is still continued innovation in 4G, but there's no doubt that the 4G and if you expand that question a little bit further legacy communications will continue to be down as 5G starts to scale. And in particular it's all about the way you characterize platforms too because increasingly as we roll new products and capabilities out, they will have some aspect of legacy comps built into them, but they get --they tend to be lumped in under our 4G orders. But, overall, you'll see between all our communications technology evolution focus is resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. And we continue to see the funnel pretty strong for our business across the globe.
Toshiya Hari: Great and then I had a quick follow-up. Ron you flagged the risk around China over the past couple of quarters, very impressed to hear that you guys had record bookings in the quarter. So I guess the question is how you are achieving record bookings given the weak macro backdrop, as well as sort of a difficult political landscape. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Sure. We're seeing exceptionally strong orders from China right now because we have a broad base of solutions. We have solutions that we're selling for 5G for auto, for 400 gigabit, for A&D below certain performance level. And that has given us very; I would a strong double-digit orders as well as strong double-digit revenue growth for the quarter. There were some pull-ins but then again there were also some push outs and even if you were to factor out the push outs, we still had double-digit growth in China. So we are winning and the end users and the companies really want our products. So we hope to trade situation, gets a little better but it's not an excuse for us at all as we've seen outstanding order and revenue growth in China.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is open,
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. Most of the Q&A in a conference call was focused on your core business, which is definitely very impressive and doing well. Shifting over to area that could potentially be of improvement I kind of see that Ixia sales grew about 1% year-over-year. Should they ever mirror or kind of fluctuate with orders like an attach rate that's closer to your revenue growth year-over-year or does it not work that way? How should we think about Ixia and what you're doing there?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. The Ixia Solutions for 5G or later on downstream, so a product for instance first gets designed and they buy -- our customers by our electronic design automation software. Then they use our products to go ahead and to develop solutions at the physical layer. Once that's done you can start testing all the protocol layers whether it's for the handsets or the user equipment or whether you're talking about four base stations or for the networks in the cloud. So that follows what you typically see in the beginning. So as Satish mentioned, we're at the beginning of this 5G wave. And we will see Ixia accelerate because you can't go ahead and test the protocol until you've actually built out physical devices and then you start putting software layers on top of it. So we will continue to see the Ixia business accelerate in prominence in our business. And we're very excited with it for instance their new solution that we just came out with.
Jim Suva: And then the quick follow that --follow-on flow through for Ixia benefit. Is that a 2019 positive or is it more further out like 2020 and beyond? We're just trying to figure out the inflection point of when that business-- it seems like at some point it's really going to shift into a much higher gear than it is right now.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Well, I'll let Neil get a chance to talk a little bit about that. As you know, we've been integrating Ixia and we found areas where we could work together to improve our solutions and our processes for longer term growth and longer term gross margin. We actually had as you saw the record revenue even though was only up slightly from where we were in the past, but it was the highest level since the acquisition. Neil, I don't know if you want to add a couple of comments with regards to modeling on Ixia. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Jim maybe just a couple of comments. I think the specific quarter or a period of time when these businesses will transition to from physical to protocol layers is difficult to call. That being said, we're encouraged by the 400 gigabit growth we've seen in classic Keysight and Satish's Communications business over the past several quarters. And we think that bodes well for future growth and Ixia on the protocol layers. I guess if I was just going to summarize that we think relative to where we were in 2018 and where we are today, there's upside from Ixia both in terms of increased growth and increased profitability that will be net added at the Keysight going forward.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes. Hi, Neil. I missed the [Technical Difficulty] 
Neil Dougherty: Vijay, there is a problem with your phone. We can't -- it's very garbled. We can't understand --it's unclear. We have no idea what you're saying. Why don't we put-- operator, if we could put VJ back into the queue and let's move to the next caller and we'll come back to VJ at the end.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer from Thompson Davis. Your line is open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon guys. Great quarter. You mentioned the semiconductors dropped off kind of in line with expectations. So can you remind us, what are your expectations for kind of how long this tough patch last? I think you said maybe late 2019 you'll start to see recovery?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Ron I'll take this. Just to keep it simple we've essentially model a softness in semi through FY 2019 and we don't have detailed models going beyond that, but at least through the remainder of this fiscal year for us we're expecting semi to be relatively soft.
Adam Thalhimer: All right. And then I also wanted to ask about cash deployment and kind of the buyback. I mean you've been doing $40 million a quarter pretty consistently here. You got a great price on the stock that you bought in Q1. What are your thoughts on cash deployment going forward?
Neil Dougherty: No. We don't expect any immediate change to our cash deployment efforts. As we stated when we announced the share buyback program the initial intent would be to remain anti-dilutive and we expect to continue along that track. Obviously, we saw a pretty significant increase in cash flow generation this quarter. We do want to maintain some excess cash on the balance sheet so that we can maintain the flexibility needed to invest in the business. And as that cash balance grows, we'll continue to look at appropriate ways to deploy it. But we continue to have active M&A funnels continue to buyback shares and we'll continue -- no immediate changes to our cash deployment plans.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. And just with regards our free cash flow conversion four years ago, we were in the mid-60% range we stated at our last Analyst Day, we would get it to the 80% to 90% range at this time. This quarter was exceptionally strong at 119% on our conversion. That's obviously above average, but we're very, very pleased with our ability to start taking that to the bottom line.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. First of all, just wanted to ask, Ron, could you kind of speak -- double back to the aerospace defense business and the growth rate there? I think we had -- generally speaking we had a fairly easy comp there. Was the government shutdown an issue there at all? Or is the -- has the backlog build on the aerospace and defense side meaningfully? Or maybe just kind of speak to that?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I'm going to let Mark Wallace make a couple of comments. But as you saw, we saw a 3% revenue growth in aerospace defense. So we think there's a lot of upside, but money did get clogged. The only area where we saw that it was relatively weak was Russia. But Russia in particular is less than 2% of our total business, but it did pull down once we start looking at just our aerospace defense business. But overall, we saw the U.S. and we saw China being pretty decent. But Mark would you like to add a couple of more comments on aerospace defense, please?
Mark Wallace: Yes, Ron. Rick and Ron covered it pretty well. We did see strength in the U.S. and China despite the RPL companies that were named last year. So we're continuing to grow. This is year four or five of the China plan, so we expect to see some growth in investment and we're capturing quite a bit of that. The other thing is the government shutdown tended to delay some of the process. So we built a nice funnel as we go into Q2. And then seasonally, as you get into the second half of the year, especially as you get closer to the end of the U.S. government fiscal year, we expect to see some of those opportunities strengthen.
Neil Dougherty: Let me add to that if I could. So we grew 3% -- the revenue line grew 3% in total, but one of the two divestitures we completed within the last 12 months was specific to aerospace defense. So just for that, we don't typically talk about core growth at the segment level, but aerospace defense grew 7% on a core basis on the revenue line. So it was immaterial in total, but quite material to aerospace defense. And then as Mark said, we saw pretty good order strength in both China and the U.S. offset by weakness in Europe as -- from Russia which is what Ron talked about.
Richard Eastman: I see, okay. If you think about the 7% core number without the divestitures did the -- was the book-to-bill there greater than one in A&D in the quarter?
Neil Dougherty: We don't talk about at that level, yes. I forgot the level. We don't typically share.
Ron Nersesian: 6% order growth -- 6% order growth for A&D and the book-to-bill was very, very close to 1. We think money -- as starts to flow, it will change.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just a question around the 5G marketplace and how Keysight addresses it. What's the strategy, Ron, around the manufacturing test site for 5G? Historically, we've had a very good market share in base station test on the manufacturing side. Hence, the test -- we kind of a pull back there, I believe, earlier in the 2000s, mid-2000s. But I'm curious, what would be the approach this year around 5G, I'm going to say devices test versus base station test on the manufacturing side?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. Well, first of all, the first step is component test. And the components are tested when you get to the final, let's say, handset or device that you're trying to test, the components have been rung out. There is very minimal test that is done at the overall device. And that's why we moved away from that. We are very strong in component test; we're the number one player in the products that are used. We have over 50% share in the network analysis business, which does all that component test and that's a very good business for us. The second is in base station test, and we continue to be strong in base station test and we have new solutions and we have, I would just say partnerships that are very good there. The other thing is when you talk about all this and you start moving to 5G, it's not just about getting the signal to the cell tower. You need to go ahead and overhaul the overall network to handle massive amounts of data from 5G as well as IoT in general. And that could be moved to 400-gig. And as we see that, we have a lot of products and solutions that are very, very strong in that area. On the end of device, let's say a phone or an iPad, there isn't much money there. So we are opportunistic, but we capture a lot of revenue and profit in components in base stations and in the network area.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And if I might just one last one sneak one in. Neil around Ixia, 9% op margin in the quarter here, is this a baseline level of operating profit margin at $129 million of revenue? Or is there some self-help margin expansion yet to come against just call it $130 million run rate -- quarterly run rate?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I think we're, obviously, not satisfied with the 9% operating margin. We'll continue to drive that first into the mid-teens, and ultimately we expect to get operating margins in this business I can go ahead and start with the two as the first digit. I think the primary driver of that profit improvement will come from revenue growth given the high gross margins in this business. That's not to say there aren't other opportunities for us to do things but the primary driver that we're looking for is through the top line.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes. Hey, congratulations. Hope you guys can hear me now? Yes. I'm here in Minnesota, so out of the office. So quickly I mean Ron, Neil my question is on -- there are two questions actually. The first is around any geographical color you can give on the 5G strength, this question does get asked quite a bit from clients. Is this primarily a U.S. order book, or are you also seeing like orders coming from like Japan and Korea who have this nation-state intensity in 5G? And then a quick follow-on for Neil.
Ron Nersesian: Sure, I'm going to let Satish answer that, but clearly we saw 5G strength in the Americas. We also saw it in China. We announced and talk about a deal that we had in Japan on the earlier part of the call. But Satish, why don't you give a little bit more color on our 5G profile?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Well, thank you, Ron. I think as I mentioned before, Vijay, it's very clear that we're contributing broadly across the ecosystem of customers and across the globe. No doubt the countries that Ron referenced are building their local capabilities and many of our customers in those regions Korea, Japan, China and the Americas are dominating but definitely we continue to see broad participation for orders across the globe. In fact if you will attend Mobile World Congress, we look forward to hosting a number of investors, I know Jason Kary and Clay have put a schedule together and you will see on display a pretty broad diversity of customers who are actually applying Keysight technology to really showcase their pioneering innovation and 5G readiness. I hope you get a chance to see it live.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, I'll be there as well. A quick follow-on for Neil. Any color or puts and takes you can give on order trends? I know there was some wildfire impact and all but just clarify to us in terms of quarter-on-quarter year-on-year kind of the order momentum in the business ideally normalized for the wildfire's impact? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, we were very pleased with the performance that we delivered in Q1. We talked about it being a record for our first quarter. As we look forward to Q2, we have a very strong funnel of opportunities entering the second quarter. So, I think that bodes well. If you think about it from a seasonality perspective, we do typically see our strongest order quarters being in Q2 and Q4. And that's partially linked the way we pay our salesforce. We essentially have two quarter periods one for the first half one for the second half. So it tends to be a big push at the end of each of those which then leads to a little bit lower orders and correspondingly revenue in Q1 and Q3. So, that's how we typically think about the business but we have a great funnel of opportunities. We see broad adoption of our solutions across a number of ecosystems. Most notably the ones we've been talking about 5G, automotive, aerospace, defense; really had a great quarter for our software solutions here in Q1. So we're seeing continued increased penetration of software and that increasing as a mix of our overall order and revenue base.
Vijay Bhagavath: Congratulations.
Ron Nersesian: Yes. It's worthwhile to note that if you combine Q1 and Q2 as we mentioned last year, it normalizes out the fire impact where we had less shipments in Q1 and more in Q2. So as Neil had mentioned we have a very strong funnel going into the quarter. And if you combine Q1 and Q2 our guidance at the midpoint is 14% core revenue growth for the half and 41% earnings growth for the half without effectively neutralizing out fire seasonality. End of Q&A
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Well, thank you Kensie and thank you everyone for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at Mobile World Congress and some of the upcoming conferences and other events that we have and hope you have a great day. Thank you.

Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a very strong finish to a breakout year with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, fourth quarter revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis to reach a record $1.1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 42% year-over-year EPS growth. Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next-generation technologies, and we continue to achieve broad-based momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. The investments we had made over the past several years in our technology, solutions, software and services are delivering results and have enabled Keysight to be at the forefront and capture the demand we see in the market. And third, 2018 was an outstanding year for Keysight. Revenue grew 20% to reach a record $3.9 billion. We achieved 13% core revenue growth, which was above our expectation of 11%, and we delivered 28% year-over-year EPS growth for 2018. Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the fourth quarter. We achieved $1.01 per share in earnings, which was $0.13 above the midpoint and $0.10 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 42% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 9% in total to surpass $1 billion. This represents our second consecutive quarter of orders above $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 10%. This was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth and the third quarter out of the last five with orders above $1 billion. Our continued strong order growth has translated into another quarter of record revenue, which was also above $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Q4 revenue grew 16% or 17% on a core basis. We're delivering broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business and across our major geographies, including China. As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some expected headwinds in China as a result of global trade tensions, which we expect to continue in 2019. Despite this dynamic, the breadth of our product offering across the diverse set of end markets enabled strong revenue growth in China in Q4. In particular, we saw a good growth in commercial communications, where we had strong differentiation in 5G. 2018 was a record year for Keysight with total order growth of 20% or 12% on core growth. This brought our total orders for the year to over $4 billion, a new milestone for the company. Total revenue grew 20% to a record $3.9 billion. On a core basis, revenue grew 13%, which was above our 11% expectation. We achieved this growth while also delivering our targeted core operating margin incremental, which resulted in $618 million in net income, up 34% over last year. Our results for this year were driven by good demands trends and strong execution on the plan we implemented four years ago to innovate and be a leader in our selected markets, create value for our customers and deliver growth profitably. At that time, we made the commitment to deliver annual EPS growth between 8% and 10% on a 4% core revenue growth CAGR, which we expected to achieve in 3 to 4 years. Earlier this year, we increased that target to 10% or greater EPS growth. I am pleased to report to you today that within three years time we not only met that target, we exceeded it and delivered 28% EPS growth in 2018. Creating value for our customers by providing leading edge technology solutions and insights that help them be at the forefront of innovation is the cornerstone of our strategy and the Keysight leadership model. The targeted investments we have made over the past several years in software and services, and key areas of the market undergoing multiyear transformations are delivering results. Let me share some data points with you that illustrate our growth in a few of our focus areas. Revenue for our software solutions grew strong double digits in 2018 and represents greater than 15% of our total revenue. This growth was driven by strong demand for our 5G solutions, high-frequency measurement application software and digital and photonic application software as well as the addition of ISG. In services, we achieved all-time high for both orders and revenue, as well as record double-digit order and revenue growth for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Services are an increasingly important element of our solution-centric engagement model with customers. We are building momentum in services as we increase full solution sales in key end markets such as automotive and 5G. In automotive and energy, customer demand remains high, and we delivered our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth with strong growth across multiple applications. During the quarter, growth from our top accounts was enhanced by wins with many new customers. In 5G, we are leading and delivering very strong growth in Q4, resulting in record 5G orders. Our broad portfolio of 5G solutions and engagement with leading market makers continues to strengthen Keysight's leading position in this fast-growing market. We continue to see major operator ecosystems embrace the Keysight platform. This quarter, we received endorsements from China Telecom and SK telecom. The scalability of our platform combined with Keysight's team ability to keep pace with the fast-evolving standard needs positions us for future success as 5G deployment scale. Additionally, our Ixia Solutions Group secured important new 5G orders with leading mobile operators in Japan, Korea, China and The U.S. It is exciting to see ISG's recently launched 5G solutions gain momentum with these Tier 1 accounts. Our combined technologies enabled Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. The contract manufacturing transition continues to take longer than we expected. That said, we have continue to make progress in optimizing the ISG business post-integration and order strengthen in the quarter for both visibility and test. We are confident in the plan we have to create long-term shareholder value. In summary, 2018 has been a year of great success and strong revenue and earnings growth. As we look ahead, we believe Keysight is well positioned to expand our leadership as our markets evolve. We have built a robust innovation engine and a broad portfolio of solutions that spans multiple segments. Our solution-centric approach to the market builds deep customer relationships that fuel innovation and customer success. We will continue to focus our investments in these key areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. Importantly, we have maintained our strong focus on financial discipline and operational excellence to drive earnings growth, while investing in key areas of the business. Before I turn the call over to Neil, I would like to thank every member of Keysight's team for their dedication and hard work that made our record 2018 results possible. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter as we continue to execute on the demand we see in core areas of our business. For the fourth quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1,051,000,000, which was above our guidance of $1 billion to $1,020,000,000. We also delivered $1.1 billion in orders in the quarter, which were up 9% in total and 10% on a core basis. Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported gross margin of 61% and operating expenses of $408 million, resulting in operating margin of 22.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $193 million and delivered $1.01 in earnings per share, which was up 42%. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $114 million. In conjunction with our annual financial planning cycle and asset impairment review, we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment charge of $700 million net of tax, primarily due to weaker-than-expected market dynamics experienced in the Ixia Solutions Group. While this is disappointing, the Ixia Business is a valuable asset in the Keysight portfolio. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities created by combining Ixia's strength in networking and Keysight's strength in wireless and physical layer test. Our combined technologies enable Keysight to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow, which we view as a significant differentiator as wireless and wireline technologies continue to converge and 5G moves into commercialization. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $566 million, up 23%, while delivering record gross margin of 63.7% and record operating margin of 27%. In Q4, Commercial Communications delivered strong double-digit order growth and record revenue of $357 million, up 28%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in data center next-generation 400-gigabit and high-speed digital test. Aerospace defense and government grew 15% and generated revenue of $209 million. Aerospace defense and government growth was driven by continued strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain, including space, satellite, cybersecurity, radar and electronic warfare applications. For the year, CSG revenue grew 17% to reach a record $2 billion. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated fourth quarter revenue of $249 million, up a record 21%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 60.6% and operating margin of 26%. Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q4 revenue of $115 million, gross margin of 70.5% and breakeven operating profit. ISG orders grew mid-single digits year-over-year and double-digit sequentially, driven by 5G wins as well as increased 400-gigabit and visibility sales. We were encouraged to see another quarter of improved sales execution, but as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition is ongoing, which impacted ISG's Q4 revenue and operating results. We remain confident in our ability to work through these challenges, grow the business and increase profitability. Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 10% in Q4 to reach a record $121 million, while delivering 40.9% gross margin and an operating margin of 13%. Q4 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. This brings SSG revenue for the year to $461 million, up 10% over last year as our pivot to an organic growth strategy takes hold. As Ron highlighted, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.9 billion and gross margin improved 70 basis points to 60.7%. To fuel innovation and further strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest, while at the same time, remain within our operating model. We achieved our core operating margin incremental target for the year and achieved 20% operating margin. This translated to strong 28% earnings growth and reported non-GAAP net income after taxes of $618 million or $3.24 per share for the full year. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $913 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $235 million and free cash flow of $201 million, which represents 19% of revenue. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $423 million or 11% of revenue, which includes the onetime $85 million accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan that we discussed last quarter. Under existing share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 634,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $63.11 for a total consideration of $40 million. This brings our total repurchases for the year to approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $57.91 for a total consideration of $120 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect first quarter 2019 revenue to be in the range of $965 million to $985 million and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.82 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. For 2019 modeling purposes, I would like to remind you that the quarterly revenue seasonality in the first half of 2018 was heavily skewed towards Q2 as a result of the closure of our Santa Rosa facility due to last year's wildfires. Historically, sequential revenue growth from Q1 to Q2 has averaged mid-single digits. With regard to our tax rate, based on our latest assessment of the benefits of tax reform, we are currently modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '19, a or reduction of 3 percentage points from our prior rate of 15%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Jesse, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, if you look at the business in the fourth quarter, clearly quite a bit of momentum across the board. Where would you say were the biggest areas that surprised to the upside relative to your guidance? And then just look out to fiscal '19, any goal posts you can share with us relative to your 4% to 5% long-term top line growth target? Understanding you're lapping pretty tough comps, but what areas of the business you think get stronger versus those might moderate a bit?
Ronald Nersesian: Brandon, one of the good things is that a lot of our growth initiatives there are hitting on all cylinders and continue to break the records. 5G is the area that is -- has grown triple digits as we had talked about, and it continues to be very strong and very strong around the world. And that feeds into our commercial communications business, which is also very strong as we reported our revenue for overall for China. That was a bit of a surprise how strong that was, but our services business, for instance, has grown double digits throughout the year. On top of that, our automotive business has grown very strong. So when we look at, for instance, revenue growth of CSG of 23%, we see also EISG at 21%, SSG at 10%. All of those are doing well, but EISG and SSG driven primarily from commercial communications and automotive seem to be strong. There's is no doubt that we do have a tough compare compared to with this last year, which the performance was so much better than the year before, but we actually see upside to that 4% to 5%. And Neil, feel free to go in and to add some more color to that.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I think, Ron, you hit it. I think we feel like we're at the front end of the number of secular themes that will continue to provide growth opportunities for us moving forward. As you mentioned, Brandon, the 2018 growth will provide some tougher comps for us, particularly in the back half of the year. We're weighing that with the strength we see in our growth initiatives with some potential headwinds in China as well as in semi. But all in all, we see some upside to the 4% to 5% long-term growth target that we put out there for the company, and we feel we have a broad portfolio of solutions and selling to diverse set of end markets, and believe, we're well positioned across that entire space.
Ronald Nersesian: And again, if you look at our growth initiatives, services, automotive and software all grew double digits in orders. And the only exception was 5G, which grew triple digits. So that momentum continues to be strong, and that's why we're raising the outlook relative to street consensus going forward for Q1.
Brandon Couillard: That's helpful. And then one more, Ron, with respect to Ixia, it wasn't quite clear that the contract manufacturing transition is still behind you. Should we still think about that as a headwind to the top line for that business segment in the first quarter? And then with respect to the revenue synergy target of, I think, $50 million-plus by year three, is that still a relevant figure that's still intact in your mind?
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. Well, let me just start and say, overall, although we have at a record year, all is not perfect. The Ixia integration has become a bigger job than we had thought it originally. We're making excellent progress, but it's taking longer than we originally thought. And we have a -- we've a multifaceted plan to go after this. One, we put new leadership in place with Mark Pierpoint to lead that group, and that's working out very well. We've completed our transition and integration to a new sales platform that will help make sales much more integrated and also share on the information to really accelerate our revenue synergies, which are starting to pop up with Satish in our general Communications Solutions Group. We've seen improvements in our order flow, in our funnel conversion throughout the quarter. And as we reported, we had mid-single-digit growth for ISG in orders this past quarter and double-digit growth in orders sequentially. But we are consolidating the CM supply chain, and we're transferring about 75 products and major products, I should say. And although they're not new products, it's a whole new process that we're putting into this CM. And what it will do, it will improve the quality and lower the cost to provide great performance in the long term. So that's what's going on. We still have a lot of confidence in the business. We recently introduced new solution, the AresONE solution for 400 gig, it is the denser solution to go ahead and to address this need. Compared to the competition, it's very, very strong. So we're excited about that. And now, I'll turn it over to Neil, who could talk a little bit about the guidance and the financials for Ixia.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, Ron, I think you covered it pretty well. I think, as Ron mentioned, the contract manufacturing transition has taken us longer than we expect, but we would point to the strong order growth rates that we saw in the quarter. And you mentioned revenue synergies, I think, we can point to Ixia's success in China, particularly at some of the bigger customers that have been strongholds for Satish's commercial communications business and the winds that we're getting there as evidence that we are getting revenue synergies in this business. So I think as we look forward, we remain confident in our thesis and that as wireless -- as 5G rolls out and wireless and wireline converts the ability to provide end-to-end solutions across communications ecosystem by bringing these businesses together in the end is a winning strategy.
Ronald Nersesian: It may be worthwhile for Satish to add a point on what he's seeing in 5G and how it intersects with Ixia?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks, Ron. Clearly, on one way you look at 5G as a wireless standards evolution, but it's really causing the entire communication block diagram to be reconstituted or transformed. And that transformation is occurring end-to-end, you start with devices, the entire memory system start changing and then you go into the cloud and the core network side, there is fundamental shifts occurring there. Our ability to sort of keep pace with the needs of the entire ecosystem is a big differentiator, and you can see that in our continued momentum of 5G orders in the company. We are into -- in conversations with lead customers today, because of the fact that we have the entire 5G stack end-to-end. We don't have to look elsewhere, we can look inwards and provide the complete solution for the ecosystem. So I continue to believe that getting this entire capabilities together will keep the momentum for our 5G success going for some years to come. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath: Ron, Neil, the mood at your company should be party like it's 1999. So yes, I know it's a tough tape still. A question for you, which you get asked a lot from clients is how should we think about the duration or the longevity of some of these secular growth drivers you mentioned? You could pick on, for example, 5G, the aerodefense program complex, connected cars ADAS. So that we -- from a modeling point of view, we get an understanding of the longevity and the duration of some of these growth cycles? And I have a follow-on for Neil.
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. Well, first of all, I just want to say as you said, people of the company should be happy. We just sent out a note that our employees have variable pay based on their performance, and they're receiving record of bonuses for this record performance during the last year, and there is nothing that makes me feel happier than to be able to share this success with all the employees that are working very hard. Second, with regard to the growth initiatives, one of the things that we looked at when we set this up roughly four years ago was to look for a secular growth trend that last at least a decade and typically two plus. And that's what we're seeing in 5G as well as in commercial comps, and we're seeing it in automotive with ADAS, et cetera, and these trends are going to go on for a long period of time before you see automotive get to Level 5, and there is plenty, plenty of opportunity for us as this gets implemented and safety becomes extremely important and there are multiple technologies that are utilized. 5G, it's the same thing before that gets implemented around the world. A lot of times we forget and we think of how fast The U.S. is moving or how fast, for instance, China is moving right now and other countries. The world is much bigger and nobody -- there's many, many countries that will utilize this technology, that will not see it for many years, but we're starting to see some countries that will be seeing their first rollouts very soon. So we're really excited that you'll see these growth initiatives and what we have going on for another decade, at least. And again, we will also look as we continue to build those out to add more, but right now there is such a opportunity and a gold mine in these applications, we're focusing and it's providing us the growth that we had promised and then some as well as the earnings growth, which is our ultimate job.
Vijay Bhagavath: It's very helpful, Ron. Neil, a question for you. Recently, we have been kind of picking up on the tape here, some design wins and success story with, for example, China Mobile, South Korea Telecom and perhaps other places, rest of world. So how should we think about gross margins and also sales OpEx versus those in the U.S.? Would they be roughly comparable? Would they be meaningfully below their U.S. counterparts?
Neil Dougherty: It's a great question. Thank you, Vijay. I think from a gross margin perspective, we do not see big differentiation as we look to the different geographies around the world. The biggest differentiator we see on the gross margin line is whether or not we're selling into an R&D lab for an R&D solution or selling into a manufacturing line once production has begun -- once volume production has begun. Obviously, the overwhelming majority of our 5G sales at this point are still in the R&D phase. Satish did reference last quarter that we had gotten our first manufacturing order, but again that's really around the edges at this point. What was the second part of your question? I'm sorry.
Vijay Bhagavath: The second part is also like the sales OpEx, like the cost ...
Neil Dougherty: Yes, sales. Yes, the sales OpEx. There, I would look to reference the initiative that Mark Wallace has to double our number of direct frontline sellers. That's a multiyear effort that we are undertaking to essentially increase the capacity of our sales force and ultimately drive the top line. I'll let Mark make additional comments. Obviously, there will be some additional expense associated with that, but you can think of it as kind of continuing into operate within the current operating model on a percentage basis, maybe get a little leverage.
Mark Wallace: Right. And just a comment, the way we're deploying the resources are where the growth and the opportunity, where the market inflections are occurring. So as there's a lot of growth occurring in Asia, in China, in Korea and other locations like that, that's where we're focusing a lot of our increased capacity and capability. So we're really focusing on a pretty surgical deployment to follow our growth strategy on increasing our capacity to support customers and grow the business wherever that may be.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari: Great. In EISG, you guys delivered very nice acceleration in the quarter, 21% growth year-over-year. You guys talked about strength pretty much across the board, maybe outside of semiconductor test. But as you look out across the next 12 to 18 months, how should we think about sustainability of growth here? I know some of your subsegments are a little bit more secular in nature, I know some of your businesses are a little bit more cyclical. So if you can help us with the modeling for the next year or so, that would be helpful.
Ronald Nersesian: I'll let you take that one, Neil.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Happy to do it. So just a couple of comments as it relates to subsegments within EISG. As Ron has already indicated with regard to automotive, we really believe that we're in the front end of a multiyear rollout of next-generation auto. And so we just don't see any reason to believe that the growth there is going to subside anytime soon. The 2 other segments and they are obviously semiconductor and general electronics. The general electronics business is really extraordinarily diverse set of business. It's probably the most tightly linked to the overall macro environment. And so there is no one single driver in that business, but as long as the macro economy stay strong and electronics in general, are doing well, we'll continue to generate strong revenues in our general electronics business. And lastly, semiconductor, we've been cautious about semi for several quarters in a row. We did put up really strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, but orders in the fourth quarter, as we expected, were down in the fourth quarter. And so we are expecting some softness in the semi piece of our business going into next year, but I would remind everybody that semi as a part of Keysight is substantially less than 10% of our overall revenue.
Ronald Nersesian: And it's probably worthwhile to note that orders overall were great -- was greater than revenue, and we built backlog again in Q4.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, again execution on the margin front was very strong as well. I think you're already in your long-term model range of 22%, 23% despite some of the near-term weakness at Ixia. How should we think about potential upside in margins as you think about your business over the next 12 to 18 months?
Ronald Nersesian: We're committed to doing two things. One, providing a 40% incremental and two, reinvesting in the business for growth. So as long as we continue to see opportunities there, as we see upside, you can count on a 40% incremental and you can count on us doing everything we can to grow the top line and bottom line even further.
Operator: Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays.
Peter Zdebski: Peter Zdebski on for Amir. I just want to circle back on China. When we last checked in, there was a little bit of headwind on the A&D side from related to trade situation, trade restrictions. Is that continuing? Has it sort of flatlined or improved at all?
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. It's a great question, Peter. The first thing that's probably not apparent is that now what we see is our A&D business in China as a relatively small portion of overall China sales. It's less than 15%. So most of the business that we see there is commercial comps, and we see some general purpose products, but so 85% is nothing to do with aerospace defense, which sees the, let's say, the more short-term pressure. So that's the first answer, and I'll let Satish make some other comments about his aerospace defense business.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Thanks, Ron. Overall, I'd say, aerospace defense had a record year finishing the year at close to $800 million in revenue and sales. And as you pointed out, China is a small part of it. We saw some softness in China as anticipated specific to the aerospace and defense application, but it was more than made up for -- to the strengths we saw in our commercial comps business.
Peter Zdebski: Okay, great. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up specific to China in the semi business. When we last checked in, that was substantially exposed to sort of the evolution and neogeometries and more on the R&D side, has that -- is that still strong in the quarter?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. As I said, semi revenues were very strong in the quarter, but we did see a softening or a slowdown in the incoming order rate during the quarter. The two drivers, as you mentioned, were the -- moved to smaller process architectures as well as to the general fab buildout that's happening in China. But semi orders were, in fact, soft during the quarter.
Ronald Nersesian: We got a huge buildout last year, wherein about 17 different foundries in China were formed and that created a nice base or let's say, a healthy compare. But what's also interesting is that we built backlog in the semi business this year, we built it also last year. So things are pretty reasonable there.
Operator: Your next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup.
Jim Suva: Your results are very stellar. So I guess, I'll focus a little bit on more of the opportunity. When we look at the revenues for services up year-over-year nicely, margins down year-over-year. A lot of investors get concerned when they see those trends. It sounds like from your prepared comments you're investing in the sales force and such, and increasing the number of body, is that the way to think about it? And when we do that, is it like a six month, nine month? How long to kind of sow before the harvest comes from those efforts?
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. I think, Mark Wallace, Head of Sales, can give some initial comments, and then Neil will follow it up with the financials.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks, Ron. Jim, we're deploying new resources continuously. And it -- yes, about six months to bring resources on board, but it's happening over multiple phases across multiple parts of our business. Last year, at the beginning of our fiscal year, we deployed the first global services sales organization within Keysight. So we've had our first year of having a focus sales organization. And as you heard from Ron's comments earlier, we delivered record high order growth during the year, 30% order growth in Q4, 22% growth for the entire year. So it is working. The other subtlety here is we're really putting a lot of focus across all of Keysight global sales on selling services, not just a dedicated sales team that sells value-added services. We put a lot of focus on upfront services sales. So that means when you sell a piece of equipment or a solution, we're selling more services upfront, and that's really helping us to drive growth now and over time, because a lot of this will be reoccurring. And then across the board, our services business for multivendor repair and cal is up, our remarketed equipment sales are up, and I think it's a direct result of us being successful with our organic services capability as well as deploying a sales organization that is capable of selling services.
Neil Dougherty: If I was just going to add to your point on margin, if you look at, take, Q4 financials, for example, we -- what we saw was 30% order growth and 10% revenue growth and it's -- but we pay our commissions based on orders. And so we're very happy with the performance of our services business during the year and during the quarter. Right now, we've got expenses that are some extent leading revenue because of the outpaced order growth during the period.
Jim Suva: Great. And then my follow-up question is, switching gears to your contract manufacturing challenges. I believe a quarter or two ago, maybe it was three ago, you mentioned some ERP issues. Are those completely independent of each other? Are those two somewhat related? And if so, the resolution of each of those, when should we think about it?
Neil Dougherty: I would say, at this point, they're independent issues. We did the transition of Ixia onto the Keysight ERP as well as the transition to the new contract manufacturer, both of those were executed during the Q2 time frame. At this point, the ERP issues are largely behind us. We're continuing to, obviously, work to stabilize the contract manufacturing situation. As Ron mentioned, transferring 75 complex projects into the new CM, putting processes in place to improve quality, reduce cost. We're confident in our ability to get this done and to come out the other side, but it's taking longer than we expected.
Jim Suva: And when is the duration or end of it that we anticipate?
Neil Dougherty: We haven't put a time line on it. We're continuing to work to resolve issues. We're making progress every quarter. We expect that progress to continue, and we'll keep working on it.
Operator: Your next question comes from Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis.
Adam Thalhimer: Ron, you really caught my attention when you talked about the auto orders, I mean, you emphasized many new customers. Just curious if you can give us some more color there?
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. I'll let Mark talk and some of the information we can tell you and other stuff we're restricted to share, but Mark will be able to share what we can at this point.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Adam, I think, we've been talking about new customer acquisition for several quarters now, and we have acquired several thousand new customers overall during the course of the last 12 months during our last fiscal year. That is an explicit focus across the board, including automotive. One of the vehicles, no pun intended, we're using to find and capture new customers is putting customers solution centers, where the customers are located. A year ago, we opened up our solution center right outside Detroit. It's been very successful. We have regular interaction with both new and existing customers there. And just last month or back in October, I should say, we opened up another new center in Shanghai, China, and that complements our capabilities that exist today in Bochum, Germany, in the Bay Area and other locations. So we're going to continue to deploy this strategy, it brings customers and innovators within Keysight together and it's really working very well. The other just comment I'lI make is that the additive function of Scienlab to our portfolio is making a big difference in terms of finding new customers, especially on the Tier 1 OEM side, where we have new solutions for that particular set of customers.
Adam Thalhimer: Got it. And then a follow-up. I wanted to ask about Ixia margins. At one point, I think, you talked about upper teens next couple of quarters just curious whether that's still possible?
Neil Dougherty: Well, we obviously took a step backwards here during the fourth quarter and -- but we are singularly focused on improving both the top line and bottom line in this business. Ron mentioned that we have a multifaceted plan of attack and so that is still the objective is to get this business into the teens level of operating margins as soon as practically possible.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Marchetti with Stifel.
John Marchetti: I wanted to touch a little bit on the goodwill impairment, Neil. And just maybe walk through a little bit of how you guys looked at it? Where you think you are in sort of that now? And if we should expect sort of anymore of that as we continue to move forward here, if you just kind of taken that down to bare bones at this point?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Well, I'd start by saying that obviously the noncash goodwill impairment charges, it does not change our confidence in ISG and the business and our strategy about bringing networking and wireless together within Keysight. We do -- we view ISG as a very valuable asset within our portfolio. That said, in conjunction with our annual financial planning processes and our annual review of our asset base, we did take the goodwill impairment charge really driven by two primary factors. The first is that the test and visibility markets have really seen moderated growth rates since the time of the acquisition relative to our expectations. And at least as we look forward, we expect those moderated growth rates to continue for at least a period of time. Second factor is one that we've talked about in the past. Obviously, we did have a bit of a disruption to our revenues in the second quarter of this year as part of this contract manufacturer transition. And as we talked about that, that transition is still ongoing. To answer the second part of your question, we don't believe that we're going to face any additional impairment, because we have, again, the multifaceted plan in place to improve this business. We are getting traction in the marketplace. Ron talked about the increasing sales velocity. We talked about the ability -- the driving orders with the new 400 gig ethernet solution, the new 5G solution, we got a new Wi-Fi solution coming out in the spring. And so as we get these new technologies to market and we have the opportunity to combine the capabilities of Keysight and Ixia together, we believe that we can generate value with this asset.
Ronald Nersesian: And John, we don't expect there to be another one. We looked at that, and we're -- we feel very confident there will not be another.
John Marchetti: Okay. And then just maybe following up a little bit on that CM issue. In terms of maybe what was left on the table, is it specific product areas? Or opportunities there that have been left behind? And given what you're talking about now with some opportunities in 400 gig in 5G and you just mentioned Wi-Fi as well coming, are those new enough opportunities to where those were transitioned first or at least those sort of near-term growth opportunities at least all the way transferred over where we shouldn't expect that opportunity to be disrupted in any way?
Ronald Nersesian: No, we feel very good about where we are. Would we have liked to have had more output? Yes, there is no doubt about that. There was some component shortages that did not help at all. But overall what we have forecast and what we have guided, as you know, we beat our guidance, met or beat our guidance 16 out of 16 quarters and that includes everything that we see at Ixia. So we feel pretty good about that. And Satish, it may be worthwhile to say another comment or two with regards to Ixia and what you're seeing again.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes. Ron, thanks. One of the things that we're seeing is as we are engaging with customers on 5G and you talked about our triple-digit growth. What might be worth highlighting is the diverse nature of that growth. We see growth across the comm ecosystem. We've seen strong orders and adoption of our 5G platform from chipset providers, device makers, NEMs and operators. Especially when we work with operators, the challenges they face in deploying 5G go beyond just wireless and go into the aspects of the core network. It's all about the end-to-end equation. And our ability to have the right expertise, the right talent and have the right technology stack in the company is a big deal. And a differentiator of that, I believe, will play out in the next few years as 5G becomes more -- becomes real across the globe.
Ronald Nersesian: And the only other point that I'll add, John, is that we have transferred like most companies manufacturing facilities over time for thousands and thousands of products. So we know how to do it. Just in certain cases, working with some CMs and due to the current situation, it's just taking a little longer. So this is no different, and this will be fixed and then you will see earnings growth improve. Rick?
Operator: Your next question comes from Richard Eastman with Baird.
Richard Eastman: Just as a last second follow-up on Ixia. Is the margin profile of that business the same? Or will it be the same here published to the CM transitions and the investments that you're making in there as it was prior to your acquisition, in other words mid-70s gross margin and 20%-plus type of EBIT?
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. We're seeing upper 70s gross margin and operating margin around 20% is where we're planning to get it back to. And of course, we're looking for ways to go even further than that. But that's where we plan to get it to, and we're looking for all types of ways to continue to improve the quality and to lower the cost. But first, we're just making sure we get the flow right and making those other improvements in parallel.
Richard Eastman: And is it a reasonable assumption that Ixia shows low single-digit growth, mid-single-digit growth in '19 here, with the order growth that you referenced?
Ronald Nersesian: Neil, I'll leave the guidance to you.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We don't guide our businesses specifically. But particularly at the Keysight level, we have obviously difficult comps. But at Ixia level, we have some easier comps, and we expect Ixia to be a growth business for us in FY '19.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Fair enough. And then also on the aerospace defense side, I may have missed this, but in the fourth quarter was there an order number? And did you again build backlog on the A&D side of the business in the fourth quarter?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Ron -- this is Satish here. Yes, we build backlog for that business in the fourth quarter. As you know, the revenues for aerospace defense were up 15%. And while the orders were down for the quarter, it was down over what was the highest quarter ever for that business in Q4 2017. So the orders this quarter -- for this year were the second largest since we've been tracking this business. So the growth drivers are strong, our focus on electronic warfare, signal monitoring radar, satellite and space are all continuing to gain momentum with customers, and we anticipate growth for that business looking ahead.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Jesse, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming conferences, and wish you a good day. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding third quarter with both revenue and earnings far exceeding the high-end of our guidance. Today, I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew 17% or 15% on a core basis to reach a record $1 billion. We achieved this growth while also delivering 45% year-over-year EPS growth, which is a new record for Keysight. Second, customers continue to make strong R&D investments in next generation technologies, and we continue to achieve differentiation and momentum across multiple end markets with our solutions. Keysight orders also grew to over $1 billion and both core revenue and orders grew double digits for the second consecutive quarter. And third, we are raising our core outlook for the year. We now expect 2018 core revenue growth to be approximately 11%, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%. Now let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We've achieved earnings of $0.89 per share, which was $0.12 above the midpoint and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance. This represents 45% year-over-year earnings growth. We also delivered outstanding order growth for this quarter and reached the new Q3 record. Orders grew 15% in total to surpass $1 billion. On a core basis, which excludes currency as well as acquisitions or divestitures completed within the last 12 months, orders grew 12%. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth, and the second quarter out of the last four quarters with orders above $1 billion. Our continued strong order growth has translated into record revenue results. Q3 revenue grew 17%, or 15% on a core basis, to also surpass $1 billion. Broad-based demand and investments in emerging technologies drove double-digit order growth for our solutions and commercial communications, aerospace, defense and governments, automotive and energy, semiconductor and services. Our technology leadership solutions and industry-focused approach continues to advance our footprint in key end-markets undergoing technology transformations. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions within marquee Keysight customers. Additionally, we are adding new customers at a rapid rate. In total, we have added close to 2,000 new direct customers so far this year. This quarter, we saw very strong 23% revenue growth in our commercial communications end-market. Broad 5G related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystems, which includes chipsets, devices, networks and infrastructure. Our early engagement with the market leaders and our advanced portfolio of 5G R&D solutions continue to strengthen Keysight's leadership position in 5G. In Q3, this translated triple-digit 5G order growth. We are the broadest array of 5G solutions on the market today and continue to see strength globally for our 5G program. We are engaged with lead operators around the world such as NTT DOCOMO in their 5G deployment process. This quarter, our Ixia Solutions Group along with our Nemo Solutions team from the Anite acquisition, secured key design wins for a leading edge RAN and core network solutions for 5G, which is just another example of our differentiated portfolio of solutions. Speaking of Ixia, we were pleased with Ixia’s improved revenue performance after our expensive integration activities last quarter. We are continuing to make good progress in optimizing the business and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities. Ixia was also seeing increased 400G activity. Our recently announced AresONE high density 400 gig Ethernet test solution, one best of show at Interop Tokyo and its gaining strong interest from customers. Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter, delivering our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth in Q3. Demand was driven by broad strengths across all regions, expansion within our top customers and wins with new accounts in the quarter. Major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers continue to aggressively invest across a broad set of automotive electronic applications. This is driving growth for both R&D applications and the associated solutions supporting high value manufacturing test. In the aerospace, defense and government end-market, we delivered double-digit order growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and increased revenue by 22%. In the quarter, we saw strong worldwide demand across the aerospace and defense supply chain, including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Looking forward, in this end market, we are seeing some headwinds in China from growing trade tensions, but expect them to be offset by growing demand in the rest of the world. In the U.S., the defense budget for 2019 was passed last week. We expect to benefit from the year-over-year budget stability, as well as the significant increases in U.S. spending for research, development, test and evaluation. Across our end markets, software and services are key components for the value creation we deliver to customers. In the third quarter, revenue for our software solutions grew double-digits. We continue to see increased demand in next generation technology design as the complexity of that design increases and design cycles accelerate. Our long-term strategy to drive growth in services is also yielding results. Services orders grew double-digit and revenue grew 9% year-over-year, driven by calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. Customers' success in providing leading edge technology solutions and insights is at the core of Keysight’s leadership model. The growth we have achieved over the past several quarters were not have been possible without our commitment to innovation and the continued targeted investments we have made over the past several years. We have significantly strengthened our technology leadership in key areas of the market undergoing multi-year transformations and growth trends. We will continue to focus our investments in these key growth areas to drive innovation, create even more value for our customers and outgrow the market. Lastly, we have an amazing team at Keysight, and I thank them for their commitment to both our company and our customers. Attracting and fastering and retaining top talent across the globe as well as creating a culture of diversity and inclusion will be contributing factors to our future success. Demonstrating KLM in action this quarter, I would highlight the career comeback program we have in Malaysia for our largest manufacturing facility is located along with the sizable R&D center. I'm proud to say that through this program, we have a growing number of mothers who have returned to the workforce bringing their expertise to the company in various areas, including the electrical engineering, software developments, human resources and supply chain. We look forward to sharing with you the success of the Keysight leadership model in the quarters and years to come. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello everyone. Before I get started, I will note that all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless specifically noted otherwise. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an exceptional quarter as we continue to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business, additionally our continued focus, execution and commitment to operational discipline is delivering record results for Keysight. For the third quarter of 2018, we delivered record non-GAAP revenue of $1 billion, which was well above our guidance of $942 million to $972 million. In Q3, we also delivered $1 billion in orders, which were up 15% with core orders growing 12%, enabling us to exit the quarter in a solid backlog position. Looking at our operational results for Q3, we reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating expenses of $402 million resulting an operating margin of 21.3%, which is the highest level in Keysight's history. We also achieved record net income of $170 million and delivered $0.89 and earnings per share, which was up 45%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, generated total revenue of $515 million, up 23% while delivering gross margin of 61.7% and operating margin of 22.2%. In Q3, Commercial Communications delivered revenue of $314 million, up 23%, driven by increased 5G R&D demand across the wireless ecosystem and growth in datacenter next generation 400 gig and high-speed digital tests. Aerospace, defense and government grew 22% and generated revenue of $201 million. As Ron mentioned, aerospace, defense and government growth was robust with strong demand across the aerospace, defense supply chain including space, satellite, radar and electronic warfare applications. Our Electronic Industrial Group, or EISG, generated third quarter revenue of $258 million, up 19%, driven by strength across all of its markets, automotive and energy, semiconductor and general electronics. EISG reported gross margin of 63.1% and operating margin of 28.5%. Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, reported Q3 revenue of $119 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 8.1%. We were pleased with ISG's improved revenue performance after extensive integration activities last quarter. We continue to focus on optimizing processes in several key areas and are confident in our ability to grow the business and increase profitability. Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 9% in Q3 to reach $116 million, was lowering 40.1% gross margin and operating margin of 15.0%. Q3 services revenue was driven by growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our third quarter with $742 million in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $38 million and free cash flow of negative $2 million. This includes accelerated funding of our U.S. pension plan and we now have $85 million in order to secure tax deductibility at the current corporate rate prior to the new tax legislation taking effect. Excluding this accelerated payment, free cash flow was $83 million, which represents 8% of revenue. Under our existing share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 668,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $59.81 for a total consideration of $40 million. Before moving to our guidance, I would like to make a few additional comments about the potential impact on our business from trade tensions between the U.S. and China. We currently estimate that the expense impact from the announced tariffs is still relatively immaterial. We are also closely monitoring the potential impact of these tensions on our aerospace and defense business in China, which we currently estimate $10 to $15 million per quarter. As Ron mentioned, we believe this will be offset by the strong demand trends we are seeing in the rest of the world aerospace defense market. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.20 billion, and Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.91, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 191 million shares. At the midpoint, this brings our earnings growth for 2018 to 23% and total revenue growth to approximately 19% or 11% on a core basis, which is an increase from our prior estimate of 7% to 8%. Additionally for the year, we expect to deliver a year-over-year core operating margin incremental at or above our 40% target. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason, for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Krista, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Peter [indiscernible] on for Joseph. Thanks for taking my question. Circling back to 400G, I recall last quarter you had said that you were starting to see some manufacturing activity in addition to just the R&D. Has that firmed up a bit? Can you quantify that a little bit?
Satish Dhanasekaran: This is Satish. I’ll take that. We continue to see more activity in R&D both in the U.S. and rest of the world. Manufacturing -- early manufacturing is starting, but at this point we believe that most of the big manufacturers of RANs are out in the 2019 timeframe. Thanks.
Unidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you, and just one follow-up. Could you give us a sense of how much of the growth that you're seeing from 5G? How much of that is slowing into SSG in terms of the recurring services that will be, that will occur post-installation if at all?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, the 5G growth numbers, we are reporting, are only the 5G revenues that reflect within the Communication Solutions Group. And they do not reflect any services business at this point in time.
Unidentified Analyst: Great. Would that be along the same lines as your other businesses once it's sort of rolled out?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, that's running at roughly the same ratios where the equipment that's used for 5G is repaired and calibrated just as all the other equipment we sell for 3G or 4G or other technologies. So it's a pretty standard ratio at this point.
Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. 
Ron Nersesian: You're welcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, thanks. Hey congratulations, great results here Ron, Neil.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath: Honestly that's well deserved. So my question is around 5G, in particular, and then I have a follow-up for Neil. The 5G question would be, I mean, Verizon, in particular, quite affirmative on big plans at 5G broadband, I mean they announced in Indianapolis recently. So as we fast-forward into next year, Ron, would some of these order strength start cooling off as service providers like Verizon get into production or not really? I mean that's kind of the most frequently asked question from clients. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Vijay. Let me take this question. I think you know our -- we've shared our strategy to really work with the entire ecosystem all the way from chipsets to datacenters, and that's kind of the flow that we've been following. And what we see that's really resulting in these results is, number one, very strong industry acceleration, not only from the operator that you've referenced but multiple leader operators globally, so that's the first sort of driver. Second, with the standards just finalizing the Release 15 version of it, we've seen unleashing of about 673 entries of new features and over 866 band combinations. You combine these things together, we're going to be in R&D phase for long time to come, okay? Now I'll answer the question you just mentioned. There are some early sort of signs of manufacturing, in fact in this quarter, we had our first design win in manufacturing also to simpler some of the trial initiatives of our key customers.
Vijay Bhagavath: Very helpful. Quick follow on for Neil. Things are going well, Neil. So how do you keep OpEx in check and in control? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: So my point to our business model where we have overtime worked very hard to increase the flexibility and the portion of our dollars that are discretionary. And it's our job to manage that. And as we mentioned on the call, we expect to deliver the 40% operating margin incremental for this year, and feel like we are well positioned from that standpoint going forward. And just to wrap-up, at our Analyst Day in March, obviously, we put our targets for 2021 where we're looking to increase the overall level of profitability in the business to 23% by that period of time. So we do have work to do to drive that incremental level of profitability, but those actions are well underway.
Ron Nersesian: As we look through our budgeting process, we just don't go ahead and layer on what our topline revenue growth is and then add more expenses, we go through a process that we're in the middle of right now, we call zero-base budgeting, where we started the floor and we say, okay, what are the most important things to move the needle from where we are today to where we want to get to in the future. And that I prioritizes our expenses making sure that we have a good ROI at either being defensive or being offensive, which is our top priority. So by doing that we're able to go ahead and continually improve the operating model and hit the 2021 targets.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thank you. Very helpful.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Vijay.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much. In your prepared comments, you made some comments about the U.S., China, some tariffs, some costs and demand offsets. Can you just give a little bit more details or help us better understand kind of what you're building in and again, walk me through the costs and the savings and offsets there again. Thank you.
Mark Wallace: So, yes, I'll take that. This is Mark Wallace. So just to reiterate a couple of the points that were made at the -- in the prepared statements from Ron and Neil. So far, as we've looked at the tariffs that have been announced, the impacts are very small, immaterial. And separate from that, the trade tensions are -- and the restrictions are principally affecting our aerospace defense business in China. And as Neil mentioned, based on the current situation, we estimate that impact to be $10 million to $15 million per quarter. Now, if you take a step back, and I think Ron mentioned this as well, the strength of our aerospace, defense business globally is very strong, and we feel like the rest of the world will offset this impact to China. This is our fourth quarter in a row of double-digit order growth and we continue to see increased investments around the world, especially in the U.S. As Ron mentioned, the U.S. DoD bill, the Defense Appropriations bill has been signed before the beginning of the new fiscal year. I think this is the first time that's happened in more than 20 years. And our overall business in aerospace, defense remains very broad from satellite to MilCom radio test to electronic warfare and radar test. So it's a very large market and it’s a growing market that we're playing a big role in. And then finally back to China, just for a moment, we continue to actively monitor the situation and despite the trade tensions, our business in China continues to be strong and broad. We delivered solid double digit revenue and order growth in Q3, and we're continuing win in China with our differentiated solutions for 5G, for automotive, for semiconductor, et cetera.
Ron Nersesian: And we're not just taking a look at the advancements in the U.S. in their actual budgets going forward, and picking up obviously growth on that front. But even in China, what we're doing is we're redeploying some of our sales force to focus where there is business. So we dynamically allocate our resources to optimize our overall China business inside and outside of aerospace, defense, and we're capitalizing on the U.S. and our friendly neighbors that are increasing the aerospace, defense budgets. And as Mark mentioned, not only do we expect to see a traditionally seasonally high September or end of this fiscal year, the budget has already in place for 2019, which we haven't seen in decades.
Jim Suva: And then my follow up is on Ixia and the integration. Is it fully integrated or kind of what I say the top handful things have been done and what are the top handful of thing are still yet to come? Thank you.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, so we've talked about our big integration efforts last quarter, obviously, moving them into our ERP, shifting them from their legacy contract manufacturing into Keysight's contract manufacturing environment. The heavy lifting on those things is done. We have been working first to stabilize and revamp the business and we're very pleased with the results that we got this quarter. Obviously, we saw approximately $30 million increase sequentially in revenue. We saw 16 percentage point improvement in operating margins. But we're not satisfied with the overall level of profitability in that business. We're continuing to work on that. We have additional profit improvement plan for this quarter as we continue to make progress, and in the -- optimizing the operation of that business within the Keysight environment.
Jim Suva: Thank you very much for the details.
Ron Nersesian: You're welcome.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandan Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brandan Couillard: Ron, just at a high level, I mean, it seems incremental broad-based strength sort of across the business. How much the growth as you sort of attribute to underlying end markets getting better versus Keysight gaining share, and some of the things you may begun the new product front or the commercial sight where are you just in the right places at the right time?
Ron Nersesian: Sure, well I think it's a mix. The first thing that we did when we were reforming the company even before we went public was to identify where are the growth opportunities and what's the resources, where there is strength in the markets. And accordingly we focused on 5G, we focused on automotive and energy, we also focused on building out our services business and the list goes on. So I think we done a good job of picking the markets that actually have a higher secular growth rate relative to the other broader electronic measurement markets. On top of that, from what we can see, we believe very strongly that we are gaining share with our 11% organic revenue growth this year and much, much higher when you look at our total revenue growth. So we also, if you take a look at the core growth that we've reported versus some of the other players, I think our core growth really shows the underlying strength of the business. So Brandan, it is a mix of the two. The markets are strong, but we have taken Keysight to a point where we are outgrowing the market without a doubt compared to a time when we were with adjuvant where we were not. And the investments that we put in place are providing great returns all the way to the bottom line.
Brandan Couillard: Thanks. And then really, I think, maybe little bit early to start talking about fiscal '19 at this point, but any preliminary views you can sort of share with us in terms of how you're thinking about the topline growth next year? I mean on one hand, you'll be lapping tougher comps, but you should be lapping the easier comps of the Ixia business, some of that continues to sort of rebound on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I mean, how do we think about fiscal '19 relative to your longer term model of 4% to 5%. Is it reasonable that that might be a little bit better than the long term model? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, Brandan, it's a great question. Obviously we're very pleased with the high level of growth that we put up this year, 11% core growth for the year. And as you mentioned, that is going to approve present some stronger comps for us as we go into in FY '19. As we look at that though, we are still seeing continued strength in many of our end markets, 5G, automotive services, software, are all areas that continue to put up strong numbers. We've mentioned some of the areas that we're monitoring, being the China trade situation, the continued strength in SEMI that feels like it has to cool off at some point. We're not seeing that as of where we are today. I think as we look forward to -- as we look forward to FY '19, I do feel like we are in a stretch with the market help where there's opportunity as for some upside to that 4% to 5% long term model.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Adam Thalhimer with Thompson Davis. Your line is now open.
Adam Thalhimer: Hey, good afternoon guys. Congrats on a great quarter.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks, Adam and welcome. Thanks for joining us. I think this is your first call with us.
Adam Thalhimer: Yes, sir. Yes. I wanted to ask first high level, can you talk a little bit about expectations for orders in Q4? Because I know you are starting to comp against the tougher comps Q4 last year, particularly in communications.
Ron Nersesian: We don't report orders, so we don't guide orders going forward. You could take a look at what we guided for revenue that we believe is pretty strong. As you noticed, this quarter, our book-to-bill was approximately 1.00 or we delivered that $0.89 EPS, and that revenue growth without even eating into our backlog. So we're very, very pleased with where we are now. We haven't seen our order rate slowdown relative to our revenue growth rate. There is a slight difference in numbers, so you get a slight different percentage. But overall, we've been running basically with orders in revenues equal to one.
Adam Thalhimer: Okay. And then I wanted to ask that EISG margins were really solid in the quarter. Can you provide any thoughts on what drove that and, perhaps touch on sustainability of that trend?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So this is Neil. I mean, obviously, the biggest driver of that was the topline trade within the ISG. The R&D investments within EISG are lower than in some of our other businesses. But we're seeing broad based strength across auto and energy, general electronics, semiconductor measurement, and so we are able to get a high a degree of leverage in that business when it is growing at these levels.
Ron Nersesian: What I will add that, if you look at the three markets that we break down, which is auto and energy, the general electronics and semiconductors, all three of them had double digit revenue growth. So that's very strong and when we have very, very solid management of that P&L as we do in the other businesses, and therefore we can certainly drive it to the bottom line. The semiconductor business has higher margins and that was one of the three businesses that had higher -- high revenue growth in double digits.
Adam Thalhimer: Perfect. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Baird. Your line is now open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon, and fantastic quarter. Some real nice work.
Ron Nersesian: Thanks Rick.
Richard Eastman: Ron, could you maybe just speak for a second to Ixia, when I look at the revenue number, certainly year-over-year, it looks like the business is now stable from a revenue perspective. I'm curious a little bit around order growth there. And also is the tone of the business now that you haven't integrated stable revenue. Should we start to think about get into that targeted mid-single digit growth rate in '19 for Ixia?
Ron Nersesian: I'm going to let Mark Wallace to make a couple of comments, but you're exactly right, Rick. We have -- the integration has stabilized that business. There was a lot of work at moving contract manufacturers of getting these whole sales channels integrated so they worked with Mark Wallace Broader channel and we're very pleased with where that is right now. Our funnel is very strong. And we did see an increase in the actual conversion rate of our funnel from Q2 to Q3. And we're expecting that to continue and to improve more, but I'll let Mark make a couple of more comments.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Thanks Ron. Hi, Rick. Ron covered a lot of it. We've made great progress since we spoke last in the business and optimizing our whole sales operational process. We were very pleased with the increase in the funnel conversion during Q3, and we expect to see that continue even further in Q4. We had some really important wins. One of which was mentioned in the prepared statements with NTT DOCOMO. We introduced some new products around 400 gigabit Ethernet test, which -- one of which we won Best in Show at Interop in Tokyo. And our funnel is stronger than it's been in many, many quarters. So the outlook is good. We continue to see strong demand for 400g, like the wireless business 5G is a big opportunity for us in the future. And again, I'm very excited about where we are with the optimization of our integration and sales and the very healthy funnel as we go into Q4.
Richard Eastman: Okay. Does volume play a role -- this might be some of the things value sound like a funny question, but will volume play a role as you move forward in this margin? Because I know we have worked to do on the margin line, but I'm wondering how much of that work that we need to do yet is around cost and efficiency versus this peer volume?
Ron Nersesian: Peer volume, you're exactly right Rick is really the issue. If you take a look at this, we've had very high gross margins, and we have fixed amount of expenses. So once we start ramping the revenue, the fixed expenses will stay relatively fixed. And you'll be able to see that flow through right to the bottom line and get great incrementals.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just as a follow-up. Ron, could you, perhaps, maybe just size on an annualized basis, maybe the software business. And I'm curious with the growth we've seen in that business. Is that being pulled along or driven by 5G or automotive or any particular vertical?
Ron Nersesian: Well, there is no doubt that software is used more and more in many of the applications that we address. We got ahead and we acquire signals, but then you have to analyze them. And now with our most recent oscilloscope that we have launched, we literally make a trillion measurements per second or we sample at a trillion measurements a second or 256 billion precision measurements a second tons for channels. So as that data comes off, software is the only way to analyze that. We do some of that software within chips or in firmware or in pure software. But if I take a look at the overall business, in FY'17, it was over $500 million in software. Now as we look in this year, this quarter we're running, obviously, significantly above that. And that's even without Ixia. And when we add Ixia software in and we're going to be doing -- adding that to our total number, but we just want to make sure that we breakout the products that are -- let's say, half hardware and half software and do that correctly. You'll see that number go up and up. But there is no doubt 5G drives software as well as many of our other applications. That business is growing and we like that not only for increased margins, but we also like that for potential recurring revenue for the long term.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brandon Couillard: Just a couple of follow-ups, Neil, the service margins were down little bit year-over-year despite the top line growth, are you making some specific investments there around capabilities, anything color you can share with us?
Neil Dougherty: You know, as we've discussed about this business in the past, our original thought was we're going to be able to make some significant acquisitions, smaller ones, but a number of them in this business to increase the growth rate. We have sense pivoted to a more organic growth strategy, which does require investment. You're starting to see that hit the top line over the past several quarters, and we are confident in our ability to increase the profitability in this business. So likely into the -- to the upper teens is where we think it ultimately settles. It will likely have a profit level that is below the company average, but certainly in that upper teen ranges where we would expect it to settle.
Brandon Couillard: And then secondly on the China aerospace and defense headwind, you mentioned of the $10 million to $15 million a quarter. Just sure speak to how you arrived at that number and your confidence levels visibility around that headwind and potential that it could be worse or perhaps not actually as bad as you expect right now?
Ron Nersesian: Well, obviously, the China situation is changing every day. And so we have pretty good visibility into our end customers and have an open dialogue with them on a regular basis. And from working with our management team, we're able to assess what some of those pressures are that we're seeing in the market. I'll let Mark see if he has any additional comments, but that's how we sized it at the moment. We're monitoring it constantly. And we'll see how things evolve as we move forward.
Mark Wallace: Yes, this is Mark. The only thing I'd add to that is as the team is monitoring the situation with the trade tensions, we're obviously also paying close attention to all of our customers, and I can tell you that the overall tone remains positive. We're working with all of our customers, if anything; they're interested in working further with us. And as I mentioned before, our business is very broad in China with 5G, automotive, semiconductor and aerospace defense. So we're looking at both sides of the equation and so far the effects not wide reaching.
Ron Nersesian: We've also gone down and looked at something which China calls or the U.S. government calls the restricted party list companies that you're not allowed to sell through, and we comb through that list. We know exactly what's in the funnel, what customers buy. So any changes that have occurred in the U.S. policy on where we can sell, we've already quantified that and included that in that overall number.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary, for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Krista, and we appreciate all of you joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming conferences. And with that, we'll close and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

We hope to see many of you there. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Today, I’ll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, revenue grew to a record $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. We also achieved earnings of $0.83 per share, which was $0.02 above our guidance midpoint. Second, Keysight's core revenue and orders grew double digits and we achieved double-digit order and revenue growth in our Communications, Electronic Industrial, and Services Solutions Groups as demand for Keysight’s solutions in 5G, Automotive, and Services continued. And third, we are raising our outlook for the year. Let's now take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.83 per share and delivered strong order growth. Orders grew 23% in total, or 10% on a core basis. Broad-based demands across our markets, geographies, and channels drove our third consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Q2 revenue grew 32% or 18% on a core basis to reach $999 million. Core revenue grew double digits across all regions, including our emerging markets. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that the shipment disruption from the wildfires is now behind us. This was completed one quarter earlier than expected and without a single order cancellation. During the quarter, we completed phase 2 of the Ixia integration. We have invested significant resources upgrading their systems and processes for long-term value creation. This included integration of all procurement, contract manufacturing, trade and logistics activities to leverage Keysight’s scale. In addition, we consolidated 28 sites to drive operational alignment and cost savings and absorbed many management and administrative functions for efficiency. This was an enormous effort and stabilization took longer than expected, impacting ISG's Q2 results. Many of these integration issues are now resolved and we will deliver the committed cost synergies in the current quarter. Ixia’s leadership in next-generation technologies is integral to our solutions and software strategy. Our acquisitions of both Ixia and Anite bring Keysight into the software layers of the design and test market. With our combined technology portfolios, we are able to deliver full end-to-end solutions across the total communications workflow. Our solutions roadmap for the next several years is very exciting, especially as 5G provides new ways to connect people with their devices, cars, and things. Our Communications Solution Group, or CSG, is making great contributions in the wireless portion of 5G, and ISG is addressing the network part of the ecosystem. We have had several significant wins for evolved packet core upgrades with major carriers. Major 5G network investments in the U.S. are expected to begin in the second half of the year as carriers introduce new services. Moving to our markets, we continue to see increased investments in our emerging technologies and overall healthy market dynamics. Our technology leadership, solutions, and industry-focused approach to the market continues to advance our growth and footprint in key segments. Customers are increasingly looking to Keysight to solve their design challenges, and we are empowering them to bring their leading-edge innovations to market faster. This quarter, we saw particularly strong revenue growth in our Commercial Communications end-market following Q1's record order performance. 5G-related R&D investment continues to increase across the wireless ecosystem, which includes networks, chipsets, and devices. In Q2, we achieved strong double-digit 5G order growth. This was our tenth consecutive quarter of double or triple-digit order growth for our 5G solutions, which we believe confirms our early leadership position. As another example of our leadership, in April we announced the industry's first 5G New Radio ready channel emulation solution, which has already been adopted by five major communications customers. This new solution, based on technology acquired from Anite, offers state-of-the-art capability and enables customers to validate the end-to-end performance of their designs. Additionally, we delivered our first-to-market, 5G millimeter-wave channel sounding solution to NTT DOCOMO, Japan's leading mobile operator. Automotive and energy is another area where we continue to see strength in the quarter delivering our sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit order growth. The global race to deploy hybrid and electric vehicles, connected cars and autonomous driving capability as soon as practically possible is driving ongoing customer investments across a broad range of technologies. Investments for battery and electric drive train test are growing in strategic importance. Our ability to differentiate solutions with the acquisition of Scienlab is proving to be a critical enabler to capturing this market opportunity. General economic conditions in industrial electronics were strong in the quarter despite some modest slowing in semiconductor investment growth. We saw steady order growth for our general electronics measurement end-market, and improved demand in the education market in the U.S. and Europe. This market is an important avenue for building long-lasting relationships with future engineers. In the aerospace, defense and government end-market, we delivered very healthy double-digit order growth for the third consecutive quarter and saw Q2 revenue increase by 27% driven by continued broad-based demand worldwide.  Moving beyond our end-markets, software and services are key components to our solution-centric go-to-market approach. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio, and in the second quarter, orders for our software solutions grew double digits organically. Our new PathWave software platform, which we introduced in January, is a foundational element of our strategy to deliver software-centric solutions to our customers around the world. We have already won our first orders for PathWave Analytics and are encouraged by the many deals we see in the funnel. Additionally, Q2 revenue for our Services segment grew 15% year-over-year to reach an all-time record. Our services expansion included growth in the managed services business with the introduction of PathWave Asset Advisor. This cloud-based software, has already been enabled at multiple large customers and is assisting them with proactive lifecycle management of their test equipment. PathWave is a key part of Keysight’s leading-edge technology strategy under the Keysight Leadership Model, or KLM. This model encompasses our guiding principles as a company, enables us to deliver greater value to customers, shareholders and employees. KLM is centered around customer success and providing leading-edge technology, solutions and insights. We believe that staying true to this mission and the core values of KLM has and will continue to drive long-term business value. Corporate social responsibility or CSR is one of these core values. Demonstrating our commitment to this endeavor, we released our CSR report in May. This report details the company’s environmental, social and governance initiatives worldwide. It also includes several company impact goals to help build a better planet, strengthen communities and foster education. While corporate social responsibility has always been a part of Keysight’s DNA, these measures provide a beacon to drive our efforts, measure our progress and support stakeholder expectations. We look forward to sharing with you the success of this effort in the quarters and years to come. I will now turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello everyone. We delivered an exceptional top line quarter as we continued to execute on the strong demand we see in core areas of our business. Given the impact to the quarterly seasonality of our revenue due to the disruption from the wildfire, I will comment today on both our second quarter and first half results. For the first half of 2018, we delivered 8% core revenue growth, a year-over-year core operating margin incremental above 40% and 11% EPS growth overall. In addition, first half orders grew 30% in total, or 13% on a core basis, enabling us to exit Q2 in a strong backlog position. As expected, we saw a significant revenue ramp in Q2. We reported Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $999 million, which was well ahead of our guidance. This brought our revenue for the first half to $1.9 billion, up 25% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point favorable impact from currency. Looking at our operational results for Q2, we reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating expenses of $399 million resulting in operating margin of 20.4%. We reported net income of $158 million and $0.83 in earnings per share on a weighted average diluted share count of 190 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, as you may recall, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. Total CSG revenue for the first half was $956 million, up 11% over last year, while delivering gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 19.3%. In Q2, CSG delivered revenue of $536 million, up 27% year-over-year, driven by 5G-related R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem, early investment in next-generation 400-Gig and PAM-4 network test and strong 27% year-over-year growth in our aerospace, defense and government end market. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first half revenue of $458 million, up 11% from last year, gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 22.7%. Q2 EISG revenue was $255 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by automotive and energy and general electronics measurement, while revenue for our semiconductor measurement solutions was in line with Q2 of last year. As Ron mentioned, second quarter ISG results were impacted by our extensive integration efforts. ISG reported Q2 revenue of $90 million, gross margin of 75.8% and an 8.4% operating margin loss. We have resolved many of the integration issues and expect ISG will deliver solid profitability in the second half. In addition, our annualized cost synergies will ramp to the committed $40 million run rate in Q3. Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 11% in the first half to reach $224 million, while delivering 40.5% gross margin and operating margin of 15.5%. Q2's record services revenue of $118 million grew 15% year-over-year and was driven by double-digit growth for calibration, remarketed solutions and repair. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our second quarter with $784 million in cash and cash equivalents. We generated $111 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and $282 million on the half, as the significant Q1 timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery began to balance out. In Q2, we invested $34 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $77 million and $224 million for the first half, which represents 12% of revenue and 88% of adjusted net income. As we outlined at our Analyst Day, our capital allocation priorities are to reinvest in our business to drive profitable organic growth, to delever following the acquisition of Ixia, and strike a balance between future M&A and return of capital. Consistent with these priorities, in Q2, we repaid the final $260 million of the $540 million pre-payable debt that was put in place to fund the Ixia acquisition and we actively repurchased stock during the quarter under the $350 million share repurchase program we announced in March. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 770,000 shares at an average price of approximately $52 per share for a total of $40 million. Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter revenue to be in the range of $942 million to $972 million and Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.82, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. While we do not typically provide full year guidance, building on our positive momentum and our strong backlog position, we now expect to deliver full-year core revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8%, which is above our prior estimate of 5% to 7% and we continue to expect to deliver a 40% core operating margin incremental for the full year. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Shawntelle, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Hi. Good afternoon. Great results; would agree with you Ron.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thank you. I would agree with you; good results. A question for you Ron and then a quick one for Neil. For you Ron, you’re seeing order strength. Any comments on visibility of these orders and the pipeline you’re building up, it’s very helpful for us as investors. And then for you, Neil, on the margin line, what are the puts and takes? It came in a bit weaker than expected, maybe so I’d like to get your thoughts on the margin line? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Well, first starting off with our overall visibility, we’re very encouraged on two fronts; one, by taking a look at not only the orders that we have but the funnel that we have and then on top of that the backlog that we have built up in the past. No one knows what’s going on in the economic situation but we do believe when you look at our growth rate that we’re doing a very good job of gaining share and leading in positions such as 5G and Automotive. So that looks very good. I also will comment that with Ixia, although we had to invest a lot this past quarter to make sure that we had all the systems in place and consolidating 28 sites and absorptions of roles, I’m very encouraged to see the funnel start that we have in the beginning of this quarter.
Neil Dougherty: With regards to the margin question, I think we were encouraged by the 20% plus operating margin that we put up here in the second quarter as well as the strong incremental that we have on core growth. I think if you look at the puts and takes, obviously there was a bit of an unfavorable mix shift with the relative weakness in ISG, obviously a strong gross margin business while at the same time we were seeing great strength in our core business. I think the other thing is we’ve emphasized in the past the importance of our flexible operating model and the flexible nature of our cost structure. A core component of that is obviously the fact that 100% of our employees have a portion of their pay that fluctuates with business performance. The formula is linked to both organic growth and operating margin both of which were obviously at high levels for Keysight compared to historic averages. And so we did see a significant increase in our variable payouts in the quarter which was expected and it provides an opportunity for our employees to align themselves with our investor base and sharing the upside while at the same time providing us great protection on the downside. At the same time, we’re investing to obviously continue to make sure we maintain a leadership position in core technologies around 5G and Automotive.
Vijay Bhagavath: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, with respect to the Ixia integration issues in the second quarter, how much of those were really factored into guidance and was that more of a revenue or operating expense impact? And any chance you could size the EPS effect relative to your guidance in the quarter? And then secondly on Ixia, I’d be curious to hear how you’re tracking in terms of the revenue synergies relative to your three-year goal of 50 million now that you’re a year into the closing?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. Well, again just to repeat, we invested significant resources obviously to try to bring our systems together because our job was to integrate the businesses and get to the cost and revenue synergies sooner. And in particular, we moved Ixia on to Keysight’s Oracle ERP system. We went ahead and changed or integrated the forecasting processes, procurement processes. We set up customers where we’ve set up over 90 different customers on brand new contracts which we had to negotiate one by one obviously starting with the bigger customers. And we also changed our manufacturing location where we moved contract manufacturers, and on top of that trade and logistics processes change. So all that took a little bit more time than we thought, but we are on track with the cost synergies. We’re also on track with the revenue synergies. A matter of fact, as I had mentioned, we’re seeing a lot of technology sharing and we saw some of that just come to fruition, for instance, with the Anite acquisition that Satish has been working on in CSG. And we’re at the beginning elements of that seeing that start to work also in Ixia as we just had our Keysight Technical Conference, the biggest conference that we have every two years, and we brought Ixia and the Keysight classic folks together to do that. So we still feel very confident in the revenue synergies as well as the cost synergies, and I’ll let Neil talk to the overall model.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, just relative to guidance, again I would say that it’s really a story of some puts and takes, right. On the positive side, we were expecting the shipment recovery from the fire disruption to carry into Q3. We were able to accelerate that and obviously pull those shipments into second quarter. That coupled with the order strength in the core, the third consecutive quarter of double digit order growth in the core, we’re obviously net positive even relative to the guidance that we put out. On the flipside, Ixia, we had expected some softness and some slowing of the incoming order rate as a result of this significant integration effort, but the ability to ramp sales back did take longer than expected, so there was some downside there relative to what was baked into our guidance.
Ron Nersesian: And I’ll just add one more point with regards to the funnel. The funnel was the highest that it’s ever been inside Keysight for the Ixia business, and it’s been – it’s the highest looking back seven quarters and that’s just as far as we’ve looked back. And April is off to a good start. So that’s what gives us the confidence in our outlook for Ixia.
Brandon Couillard: Thank you. It’s helpful. And then one more for Neil. If you could give us a sense, some ballpark parameters of what the guide implies for 3Q margins? It seems to suggest about a 30% incremental but I suspect Ixia is somewhat of a drag on that relative to your 40% core target for the year?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, we continue to deliver a 40% core incremental into the third quarter and we’ll do so for the full year as well. Obviously in addition to Ixia, we have the Scienlab acquisition. We also have currency which is helping us on the revenue line but is more or less profit neutral. And so you need to take into account the impact of currency when figuring out those incremental.
Brandon Couillard: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Brandon.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you so much and congrats on the solid results. You guys raised guidance for the full year. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color in terms of where you’re seeing the upside? Is it broad based across the entire company or are you seeing the upside kind of focused in one or two specific areas?
Ron Nersesian: I’ll turn this over to Mark Wallace, our leader of sales. But as you can see from our results, we saw strong double-digit growth in three of our four main businesses. So that makes us feel very good. Now obviously aerospace, defense was very solid as well as commercial communications in the Communications Solutions Group as well as looking at total EISG and looking at total SSG. But Mark, why don’t you give a little more commentary please.
Mark Wallace: Sure. Yes, it really follows what Ron just said. Strong order results across all geographies and segments as we already know in the third quarter in a row of double digit core order growth. I see continued strengths in 5G across both wireless and networks especially picking up in the second half with some of the deployment from the network operators that have already been announced. Aerospace, defense is seasonally stronger for us in the second half and with the U.S. budget being signed, we’re expecting to start seeing some of that funding flowing probably toward the fourth quarter for us. And then our growth strategy around Automotive and energy continues to yield great results six quarters in a row of double-digit order growth. As Ron mentioned in his opening comments, the Scienlab acquisition is really an important and strategic one for us as we move into other parts of the business, including the OEMs. So it really is broad based across all regions and it really is aligned with the focus we’ve put around our growth initiatives.
Toshiya Hari: Great. And then as a follow up, Ron, I think this one’s for you. Obviously the political landscape as it relates to the U.S.-China relationship continues to be unstable to say the least. Given your involvement in leading-edge technology, 5G and other forms of wireless technology, could that have implications for your business in China or should we not be concerned? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Toshiya, that’s a great question. We have a very broad-based business inside of China. So there are aerospace, defense customers but also commercial communications customers, automotive, semiconductor, et cetera. So we have a pretty broad-based business and that makes a really nice structure. We did see as we had reported double-digit growth in China this past quarter. I cannot speak for the political landscape on what will happen there but it is broad based and I believe that they need us as much as we need them. So we’ll hope that that works out fine on the political side, but it is a pretty broad impact that we have all across segments.
Mark Wallace: This is Mark. Just to add one thing is that we’re engaged deeply with both the Chinese customers as well as the multinational customers in China and these are industry leaders and we are – as Ron mentioned, it’s not just within one segment but multiple segments. And the semiconductor growth, that’s been investing in China over the last couple of years and will continue for the next three or four years, represents a lot of opportunity for us. So I think that diversity is a very important part of the equation as well.
Ron Nersesian: And for most customers a lot of times what – the way that some of these potential issues could play themselves out is it takes a look at where the products are shipped from. And most of our products shipped from overseas, from Penang, Malaysia. So that may or may not have a more subtle impact to any type of sanctions that do come up.
Toshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you so much.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Toshiya.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open.
Joshua Kehoe: Hi. This is Josh Kehoe on for Jim. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you provide more color on the progress of your auto and energy business and when do you think it could possibly surpass your semiconductor test business as a percentage of revenue, especially considering you noted some weakness in semiconductor test for the quarter? Thanks.
Mark Wallace: Sure. This is Mark. So as I mentioned earlier, our growth initiative is really well on track, six consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth. And it’s really being fueled by the investments being made and really the raise for autonomous driving, electric hybrid vehicles and connected cars. What we have announced too, we mentioned this at the Investor Day as well as over the last couple of quarters calls, that we’re establishing automotive solution centers in several regions to help further strengthen our customer connectivity in our solution development. The one that was opened in Detroit is up and running and it’s doing very well. We plan to open another center in Shanghai, China soon and we have plans for another one in Japan as well. So this is just a further articulation of the commitment and strategy around automotive. And as I mentioned before, the acquisition of Scienlab has really allowed us to expand our solutions into the battery and charging infrastructure space. We’ve won some business already in Q2 and we expect to see that continue especially as the OEMs invest more heavily in R&D along with the overall supply chain. So I think in general we’re seeing the continued strength. As far as the semiconductor, it really serves all industries. So it’s hard to do a compare there, but it is something we are continuing to be successful in. And as a reminder, we have a pretty diverse portfolio of solutions into semiconductor from nano-positioning tools, to wafer test tools, to general test and measurement products as well as services. So that’s another key area. And again it feeds into all of the other industries that we service as well.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Josh.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf with Barclays. Your line is open.
Joseph Wolf: Thank you. A couple of questions. You touched on this briefly but I was hoping we can get a better differentiation or distinction if there is one to be made between the acceleration and the strength in the 5G cycle and then the optical cycle which I assume is somewhat adjacent but is also can be different given metro builds and timing and other builds going on in China. So I’m wondering if we can actually look at the optical communications as an area of double-digit growth separate to the 5G or whether you think about them in a combined way and how we could think about that on a product level across the different groups?
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, this is Satish here. I’ll take this one, Joe. Very insightful in that 5G is not just a wireless technology. It’s a new way of thinking about the end-to-end experience which is the way we think about how our solutions are offered. So obviously there’s the frontend piece, the wireless piece and 5G with the standards that you’re referencing and that has to work together and therefore having 400G type of technology rollout is crucial and we see that playing out both in date centers and in telecom markets. So specific to our business we’ve invested early in 5G a few years ago, made strategic acquisitions like Anite and it takes a couple of years to start to rollout those platforms. Now these platforms are with customers and you’re starting to see the success 10 straight quarters of double or triple digit growth in our 5G business. With 400G, we have obviously been well positioned with 100G. You probably – if you’ve followed us or heard us on earnings calls talk about the ramp that occurred in 2016 through mid-2017 and since then 100G has really tapered off a little bit as people have started to consume the capacity that’s in place. And we start to now see a buildup in 400G even this quarter with strong orders for 400G in R&D and some early orders for 400G in manufacturing. So we see both these things play out concurrently and synergistically and this is why we manage our portfolio with focusing on all these technology evolutions that gives us a pretty good diversity as things play out.
Ron Nersesian: And that’s one of the great things that we really appreciate about Keysight is that we play on the wireless side and the wired side. We play on the physical side, whether it’s on copper or fiber. We play on the hardware side and the software layers up to the top. So we’re really looking at this overall communications ecosystem and other ecosystems in our markets and that provides diversity for our business and provides more earnings, let’s just say stability for our investors.
Joseph Wolf: Thank you. That was actually very helpful. I guess just another question. When you think about the order pattern in the aerospace and defense, I know that this has come up on a couple of last calls, just in terms of the order strength and I guess pent-up demand or the actual procurement cycles, at least our defense analyst is thinking about this as being upside in terms of a pent-up spending cycle and things coming in ahead of expectations. Is that part or how significant is that or how conservative do you think we should be as we think about that potential given the last three – I guess the strength over the last couple of quarters?
Mark Wallace: Sure. I’ll take that. This is Mark. So I think the budget being signed back in April has alleviated a bit of that pent-up demand. We had a strong quarter. Again, the third quarter in a row of double-digit order growth and that was before any of the funding really started to flow from this year’s budget. That takes time to work through the appropriation process. So a lot of that was the pent-up demand. But really I think what I look at is the underlying driver for this is the investments that are being made around the world and especially in the U.S. to upgrade technology for information warfare and as well as the continuing shift of the prime contractors to be outsourcing more of this work. So the strong demand from the U.S. government and contractors as the budget moves its way through that process, we’ll start to see some of that upside occur again towards the end of the U.S. government’s fiscal year. And again, the encouraging thing is we see strengths outside the U.S. as well, again, around the same things; investments in solutions for EW, information warfare, radar and et cetera. So I would say it’s more about that than pent-up demand which I think has more sustainability to it over a longer period of time.
Joseph Wolf: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Good afternoon. I wondered to know if you could speak just briefly on Ixia. It sounds like you did account for perhaps some revenue disruption but the revenue there did come in lighter than we were expecting. I was just curious as you think about the second half guidance that you updated, do you assume any revenue catch-up with Ixia in that guidance?
Neil Dougherty: You’re correct. We had obviously taken into account the impact of the integration, investments and effort that we were going on. The ramp back to volume took longer than expected. And so we did have lower revenues here in the second quarter than was baked into our original guide. As we look forward, as Ron has already mentioned, we have a very strong funnel entering the quarter. We have many of the issues that we run into are now behind us. The business is ramping back towards normal. I would say we’re cautiously optimistic as we look forward to Q3 that things will return to more normal kinds of levels. I think as you look at Q3 or at kind of the gap in revenue in Q2, some of that will be lost and there’s some potential that some of that will be recovered.
Rob Mason: Okay. Thanks for that. And then just with respect to your commentary around 5G, some deployments perhaps starting in the second half of the year. As we think about moving from some of the R&D products now towards deployment, could you just speak to how you think the business – how we should think about that business just in terms of margins, how we should think about in terms of maybe revenue recognition cycles, whether there’s any difference there just as we start to make a transition? I realize it’s still early but you’re starting to see some transition.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, a good question. I think as you have pointed out about – according to GSA, about 14 operators in 11 countries have made some type of announcements around 5G deployments starting 2018. So whether you believe it’s late 2018 or early 2019, that’s a pretty significant number. When you compound that with 48 operators in 33 countries that have announced plans for 5G, it’s pretty clear that this industry is accelerating this technology, again, a trend that we saw and plan for quite some time ago. Our focus is on higher value-added parts of the market, early R&D and our contributions are increasingly for software which should give us better margin profile and Neil will probably pick up on that. But at the end of the day, for us it’s about offering our customers an advantage and we do that by offering end-to-end solutions. We provide a single stop shop now with our ability to have not only the physical layer tools but also go higher on the software stack. And with Ixia we now have the total solution for the entire ecosystem and we feel good about where we are in that 5G journey. In terms of the lifecycle, you’re correct that we’re still in the early phases. Our customers are still in the first vintage of products that are used in trials. Next will be continued R&D investments for the next couple of years in order for them to satisfy the need of the operators that I just referenced.
Ron Nersesian: I’ll just add a couple more points. With regard to our margins, we are committed to the 40% incremental. And although we could go higher than that, we want to make sure that we stay on the leading edge. That is the secret and the key to this business and we’re going to continue to invest while providing the shareholders with the type of returns that we have discussed. There is no doubt that we more software is being entered into the mix of our products with higher gross margins, but then again we have services which are also ramping and we had a record quarter for services which have lower than average gross margins. But overall we’re focused on the customers, making them successful, providing end-to-end solutions, a little bit more software in services and delivering a 40% incremental. Thank you, Rob.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great set of results. My first question is regarding the strong growth that you are seeing this year. If I look at the first two quarters, it is above 10% in the core business, excluding Ixia, which is far above what you have guided your long-term growth in the business to be. So in regards to cyclicality, is there a concern here that we might be getting overheated? And as we look into 2019, the growth may decelerate meaningfully from what might be tough compares.
Mark Wallace: So this is Mark. No, there’s really – there’s no indication that we’re seeing any sort of cycle. As Ron already mentioned, our funnel for our Ixia products is very strong. The same is true on the core products as well. So we’re continuing to build momentum. And the exciting thing is now we’re seeing growth in other parts of our business as well, including software and services. We introduced PathWave and we’ve gotten our first order for PathWave Analytics. That’s a brand new platform. That didn’t exist before Q2. So this is going into a new set of customers with contract manufacturers and ODMs and we’re going to continue to build on that going forward. So I think the investment cycles that we’re seeing with the early R&D and 5G with the early stages of what’s happening with automotive as well as other technologies that are feeding into the connectivity across the world are going to continue to give us opportunities beyond FY '18.
Farhan Ahmad: Got it. And then specific to the services group, can you talk about what specifically is driving the strength there? Because I would imagine that that portion of the business is somewhat less variable. And we are seeing more than 10% growth in the first half of this year. So can you talk about why are we seeing the acceleration in the services in such a meaningful way?
Mark Wallace: Sure. I’ll talk to about a few parts of it. Again, it was a record high quarter for us with services. And then if you look at the components of our services business, really all of them were up at the same time. Our calibration revenues were up. A lot of that growth was driven from our Liberty Calibration labs that was part of an acquisition that we had last year. So that’s doing very well. Repair was up. Our professional services were up. And a lot of the professional services are tied to our equipment sales as we provide start-up assistance for more and more of our customers as they deploy more complex solutions. So there’s a close tie there. And as has been the case for some time, our remarketed solutions continue to be very strong. We have the right mix of inventory and we’re seeing continued demand from some of the same end user segments such as wireless for our remarketed solutions. The last thing I’ll mention here too which is the strength that we’re seeing today from the solutions and product sales should help us fuel services sales in the next year to two years. So that’s also an encouraging part of having services growth now and then going into the future.
Ron Nersesian: And obviously as we see longer-term contracts, this will help us to provide a greater annuity to provide more dampening on the bottom line.
Farhan Ahmad: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I had.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Farhan.
Operator: Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing comments.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Shawntelle, and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the upcoming conferences. Have a great day.

Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We delivered an outstanding first quarter with both revenue and earnings exceeding our guidance and we are pleased with our performance and growing leadership position in the market. I'll focus my formal comments on three key headlines for the quarter. First, 2018 is off to a great start and we delivered a strong quarter across the board. Our better-than-expected results this quarter were driven by robust order growth as well as the strength of our execution. Second, customers are increasing their R&D investments in next-generation technologies and we have continued to build momentum across multiple end markets, contributing to four consecutive quarters of accelerating order growth. And third, Keysight's transformation strategy is delivering results. With our strong performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. Additionally, our order growth and backlog expansion over the past several quarters has established a strong foundation to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. Let's take a deeper look into our performance for the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.51 per share, which was $0.15 above the midpoint of our guidance and exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. We delivered outstanding order growth this quarter. Orders grew 39% in total, or 16% on a core basis, to reach a new first quarter record. Q1 revenue increased by 18% to reach $856 million, which was also above our guidance. Our better-than-expected results were driven by our strong order growth and execution, including our ability to recover from the Northern California wildfires faster than expected. With the team's diligence, focus and hard work, our Santa Rosa production capacity is running above pre-fire levels. We still have work to do in order to fully recover, but bringing production back to pre-fire levels at this site was essential, especially as customer demand for our solutions continued to grow. At the same time, we were working to recover from the wildfires in Santa Rosa, we achieved another major operational milestone in the quarter by completing the integration of Ixia's people, systems and processes. This was a significant undertaking and now we are able to book, build, ship and invoice Ixia sales on Keysight's ERP. We completed this integration in nine months, once again through the strong execution of our team. This milestone is a key enabler in realizing the committed Ixia cost synergies, and we remain on track to deliver $40 million in annual run-rate savings beginning in Q3 of this year. When I look back on everything we accomplished in the quarter, I continue to be proud of and inspired by the team's tremendous efforts and resiliency. The team was tested, rose above the challenges and delivered. We believe our execution during the quarter is even more impressive when considering the magnitude of the circumstances. In addition to supporting our employees through a terrible tragedy, we achieved above-market order growth, recovered production capability faster than planned and completed the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Once again, we thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their commitment and diligence. Moving to our markets, we continued to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strategic areas of focus, including our first-to-market position in leading-edge technologies and our solution-centrics portfolio, are helping fuel our momentum, resulting in above-market growth as customers increase their development activities and investments. The first quarter was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth and second consecutive quarter of double-digit core order growth. Order demand was broad-based and balanced across our markets, geographies and channels. We saw particularly strong order growth in our commercial communications end-market, with orders reaching the highest level since forming Keysight. Overall, we are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations such as 5G, next-generation Wi-Fi, electronic warfare, and high-value automotive. In 5G, we are seeing growing R&D investment across networks, chipsets and devices. Winning in 5G is a cornerstone to our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. With targeted investments, early partnerships with key industry innovators around the globe and ground-breaking first-to-market solutions, we have established a strong leadership position in 5G. Our 5G performance in the quarter was exceptional with R&D communications orders growing to a new record. In December, we brought together key industry players to advance 5G innovation and demonstrate our 5G New Radio network emulation software within days of publication of the first 5G New Radio specifications. We continue to further advance our 5G solutions with the goal of enabling industry-first innovation. At Mobile World Congress this week, we are proud to have enabled multiple industry-leading customers to showcase their 5G readiness with Keysight solutions. Automotive electronics and communications is another exciting area where we are seeing growth as technology advancements transform the market. During the quarter, R&D investment at major automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers was robust across a broad set of electronic applications, including wireless connectivity and power solutions. With our continued focus on developing our solutions portfolio for this evolving market, Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for five consecutive quarters. In the aerospace and defense end-market, electronic warfare and defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic communications continue to grow in importance. Keysight provides the industry's most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions and has been a long-standing leader in this market. For the second quarter in a row, aerospace and defense orders grew approximately 20%, although versus a soft compare. Over the long-term, we remain confident in our outlook and market position in this market. However, in the near-term, we expect the timing of U.S. orders to be weighted toward the end of the year given the delayed budget approvals over the past several months. Moving beyond our end-markets, software is a key component of our solution-centric, go-to-market approach and strategy to transform Keysight. Our long history of innovation and leadership gives Keysight critical insight into measurement needs, resulting in software that helps customers accelerate innovation and bring their products to market faster. Software is becoming a larger part of our portfolio and in the first quarter orders for our software solutions grew double-digits organically. Further expanding our software offerings, in January, we unveiled PathWave, the industry's first software platform that integrates simulation, design and test workflows across the entire product development lifecycle, from early concept through manufacturing and deployment. This disruptive innovation bridges the gaps between development points that were once discrete and is an important milestone on our multi-year journey to expand our software capabilities and solutions. In summary, we are very pleased with our execution and results in the first quarter. We are well-aligned with growing market trends where customers are investing in next-generation electronic technologies. And our first-to-market advantage and solution-centrics model is differentiating Keysight in the marketplace. With our accelerating order growth, expanding backlog and strong operational execution, we are poised to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018. We have an exciting line up for you at our Investor Day and look forward to sharing more with you next week on March 6. At this point, I'd like to turn it over to Neil.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron discussed, we delivered a very good quarter, even as we managed through several events that included accelerating customer demand, recovering from the wildfires and completing the integration of Ixia into Keysight's ERP. Needless to say, the past three months were extremely busy for Keysight. I would like to start today by discussing orders as given the ongoing production recovery, orders are the best indicator of the underlying business strength. In Q1, we delivered strong 39% order growth, with core orders growing 16%. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating core order growth. Ramping capacity to meet this high level of demand can be complicated in and of itself, and it is even more challenging when production and shipments are impacted by unforeseen circumstances like the Northern California wildfires. As Ron mentioned, we were pleased with our ability to recover faster than expected, and production capacity is now above pre-fire levels. It is worth noting that we have not had a single customer order cancellation as a result of the fire, and we have grown our backlog by $226 million over the past two quarters. We have made solid progress, but still have a lot of work to do to increase our shipment levels and clear our growing backlog, which was over $1 billion at quarter-end. Moving to revenue, as we discussed last quarter, we expected the disruption from the wildfires to impact the seasonality of revenue and, therefore, focused our guidance on the first half of 2018. As predicted, seasonality was difficult to forecast as we finished the quarter with non-GAAP revenue of $856 million, up 18% with a 2-percentage-point favorable impact from currency. While Q1 revenue was significantly above our expectations, it was still down 2% year-over-year on a core basis. We expect a significant revenue ramp in Q2 as the production recovery continues. Looking at our operational results for Q1, we reported gross margin of 60.1% and operating expenses of $383 million, resulting in operating margin of 15.4%. We reported net income of $97 million and $0.51 in earnings per share, which was $0.08 above the high-end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments, our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, was the business most impacted by the wildfire disruption. CSG includes two primary end markets: commercial communications and aerospace, defense and government. In the communications end market, orders grew at a strong double-digit rate as the underlying business remained strong, while in contrast, revenue of $245 million, was down 4% year-over-year, as we worked to re-ramp production. Order growth was driven by 5G R&D spending across the wireless ecosystem and early investment in next-generation 400 gig and PAM-4 network test. As Ron mentioned, aerospace, defense and government orders grew approximately 20%; however, this end-market generated revenue of $175 million in Q1, compared with $180 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $420 million with 60.9% gross margin and 14% operating margin. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $203 million, up 6% from last year. Growth was led by automotive & energy and semiconductor measurement solutions, offset by a slight decline in general electronics measurement. EISG reported gross margin at 59% and operating margin at 18.5%. Our Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG, generated revenue of $127 million, gross margin of 75.6% and operating margin of 14.5%. Gross margin in this business was unfavorably impacted by a one-time inventory clean-up tied to the ERP integration and cut-over. ISG revenue was above our expectations for the quarter as they saw an increase in shipments for their high-speed 400 gigabit Ethernet test solutions, and overall, support renewals reached a new record. Lastly, Services Solutions Group, or SSG, revenue grew 6% year-over-year to reach $106 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales of remarketed solutions and calibration with overall regional strength in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. SSG reported gross margin of 40.3% and operating margin of 15.6%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended our first quarter with $980 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $171 million in cash flow from operations. Our operational cash flows were strengthened by significant timing-related reductions in working capital linked to the fire recovery, which we expect to balance out during the remainder of the first half. In Q1, we invested $24 million in capital purchases, bringing our free cash flow for the quarter to $147 million, or 18% of revenue, which was atypical for the first quarter and, again, will even out over the half. Before we move to guidance, I will provide an overview of the impact of U.S. tax reform on our business. We expect the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a modified territorial tax system to lower our overall tax rate and provide much greater access to our global cash generation. While some provisions of the new legislation are subject to interpretation, which may change over the coming months and impact our initial estimates, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop 200 basis points to 15% beginning this quarter. The new U.S. tax law includes a deemed repatriation on existing offshore cash balances and historic foreign earnings. We currently estimate that this provision will result in Keysight paying cash taxes totaling $95 million over an eight-year period, while providing a one-time U.S. cash influx of greater than $500 million. We are currently exploring different strategies to best optimize our balance sheet and we are committed to acting in the best interests of our shareholders and maximizing shareholder value over the long term. Now, turning to our outlook and guidance, balancing our strong order growth, the current market dynamics, our better-than-expected Q1 results and the continued recovery from the wildfires, we are raising our guidance for the first half of the year. We now expect first half revenue in the range of $1.805 billion to $1.835 billion and first half earnings per share in the range of $1.27 to $1.37. At the midpoint, our first half guidance represents 4% core revenue growth, a greater than 40% year-over-year core operating margin incremental and 10% EPS growth. The midpoint of our first half guidance implies Q2 non-GAAP revenue of $964 million and second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.81, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares. Building on our positive momentum, we are pleased to raise our guidance for the first half, and as a result of our strong backlog position, we are now expecting full-year core revenue growth in the range of 5% to 7%. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason A. Kary - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Neil. Christine, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: Your first question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks for taking my question. My first question is regarding the order trajectory, you have seen an acceleration in orders. Was there any impact that you saw that people rushed to order equipment because of the wildfires because they wanted to get the test systems early on? And second, looking ahead, do you think that the order momentum can continue?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Hi, this is Ron. We didn't see any rush to the quarter because of the wildfires at all, but that never seemed to come up. None of our customers canceled any orders that they had on the books with us. And what we've seen primarily is a rush to be first in 5G by our customers. And that has driven them to want to purchase more of our equipment and purchase more of our equipment sooner. Now, some of the players in R&D have placed very sizeable orders in order to use that equipment throughout the year. But there wasn't any mention at all of the fires for any reason for the order momentum and we saw that across the broad, broad spectrum of businesses, regions and channels. As was mentioned earlier, we not only saw the fantastic results with regards to 5G in commercial communications, we also saw a double-digit software growth, we saw services growth that was in the high-single digits, we saw automotive growth, which was another double-digit growth quarter. So, the momentum is very, very broad, it's across multiple regions around the world, it's across different businesses, and it's also across both of our channels, our direct channel and our indirect channel. I think that our strategy from four years ago to focus on being first in the market and to invest our R&D dollars and really utilize our talent and expertise and work on standards committees and be there first is paying off. And we're seeing it and if you look at our results versus the competition, we're very pleased with how we're doing.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. So, if I look at your press releases at Mobile World Congress, it seems like you have announced a lot of partnerships, then if I compare it to your competitor, it seems like you guys are standing out on the momentum that you have on 5G. Can you just comment on the competitive landscape that you are seeing on 5G and, is it fair to expect that you could have meaningful share gains relative to what you had on 4G?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: See, I will say this. We don't like to comment on our competition. We like to speak to ourselves. I will say though in 4G, it wasn't our lack of performance or not being able to compete in 4G, our role as part of Agilent was to provide more cash generation. So, we did not invest in 4G, like we needed to in order to be the top leader. On top of that, we did not invest early enough. But now that we are in control of our own destiny, we are a focused measurement company. We had been doing this since day one and we're seeing great results. Another example is we needed to go ahead and to pull together solutions, and we realized where we had some gaps. So, we went out and acquired Anite, which has a lot of software expertise in the protocol area. And we have come up with solutions for 5G using products or technology that was developed at classic Keysight, at Anite on the software levels, and then AT4 wireless also over in Spain. And we put those things together to really accelerate our offering and be first. Now Satish Dhanasekaran is on the phone at Mobile World Congress. He won't be commenting on competitors, but he can share with everybody what he is seeing there from our Keysight customers.
Satish Dhanasekaran - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you, Ron. Farhan, thanks for the question. Clearly, the industry acceleration of 5G was on broad display here at Mobile World Congress. Multiple operators declaring accelerated plans, really creates a pull in the ecosystem. Something that we predicted a little bit ago, and we've been continuing to invest with a platform approach that scales for the broad ecosystem. And I know you referenced some press releases, but this goes beyond press releases. Our platform and solutions have enabled many industry-firsts. So, if you were at the Qualcomm booth for example, you would have seen high frequency 28 gigahertz demonstration with the Qualcomm X50 modem. If you were at the Intel booth, on display was our solution that helped showcase a 4K video demonstration amongst others. And if you were at this China Mobile booth, you would have seen our newest acquisition, Ixia Solution on display for 5G. So, these are powerful examples of the scale at which our solutions are being adopted. And we view this acceleration trend as a positive driver and most evidenced by the fact that we had a strong order performance in our commercial communications segment in the most recent quarter. Thanks, Ron.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you. And one last comment, Farhan. The other big factor was we have turned the company on its side over the last four years and transformed it into an industry-focused company, where now, we have a Communications Group that Satish leads up, and he has all the tools and all the products in the company accessible to him, so he could sit down with these top customers and give them exactly what they want and speak for the company. Where in the past, many years ago, while it was appropriate back then, we had many different product lines but were not total solutions focused. And this is making a world of difference because speed is a very, very big priority for our customers. And we can act fast, make commitments more quickly and pull everything together in order to be first.
Farhan Ahmad - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Got it. Thank you. That's all I have.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the strong results. I had a follow-up question on your order outlook. Ron, I think, in your prepared remarks you gave some additional color for the aerospace and defense part of your business. But I was hoping you could share some color for your comms and your EISG business as well.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Neil has gone ahead and he's talked about our overall revenue perspective. When you look in the comms business, 5G – I think if you could say one thing about Mobile World Congress is we're seeing operators as well as equipment providers and chip providers looking to accelerate their offerings and that plays right into our hands. We can help them and make them more productive and more successful. So that is good for Keysight business. With regards to automotive, we're seeing much more technology adoption with not just electric vehicles, but autonomous vehicles, and all the wireless communications that are in the actual vehicles. And it's also important to note that we only play in the high value auto. We play in parts that are very high-tech that are new and breakthroughs for this market. And we expect that to continue going forward. I'm going to turn it over to Mark Wallace who is our President (sic) [Senior Vice President] of Sales and let him make some comments too.
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Sure. I'll make a comment on aerospace, defense, you'd asked about that. As Ron and Neil mentioned in their prepared comments, we saw strong rebound in aerospace, defense orders in Q1, following a very strong Q4. So, we're very pleased with both of those quarters at nearly 20%. We see strong demand from our customers in the U.S. government and contractors, but we also see continuing strong growth and demand from our international business. And for many years, this has been a fairly stable business for us and this diversity of opportunities coming to Keysight is one of the things that drives that. So in the short-term, we all know that we're waiting for the U.S. defense budget to be signed later this month. And when that does occur, if it does, we should see some orders begin to flow probably toward the latter part of our fiscal year, just like we did last year. Long-term we have a very good position as we continue to see investments being made in modernizing the technology from electronic warfare to radar, and we're in a very good position to continue to capture that business. And then I just want to underscore the automotive initiative: five quarters in a row of double-digit growth, the R&D spend is continuing to expand, and we have really started making some traction in expanding our presence with the Tier 1 OEMs as a result of the Scienlab acquisition, the company in Bochum, Germany that we're using to help us get into the battery test solutions for the Tier 1 OEMs as well.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. And then as a follow-up, the housekeeping one for Neil. In your prepared remarks you talked about a one-time inventory related item impacting your Ixia business. How big was that? And, separately, I was a little bit surprised to see your margin number come down a little bit for EISG on a year-over-year basis. If you can kind of explain what went on there that would be helpful. Thank you.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So couple different things in there. So, first, as it relates to ISG, you'll notice that the gross margin in that business had been running around 77% and they dipped about 1.5% this quarter and it's roughly $100 million a quarter business, a little bit more than that. So that size is – it was less than $2 million – was the size of the inventory cleanup and, again, one-time related to the ERP migration that we did. On the EISG side, the gross margin change is really about mix, right. They sell a wide range of products in that business, and we see mix shift. I think one of the bigger changes there is while our semi business remain relatively strong, we really sell two main products into semiconductor: first is parametric test, which tends to be a little bit on the higher margin side; and then we sell some laser positioning systems that are still good margins but not quite up to parametric test levels. And so we saw that semi mix was a little bit – put some downward pressure on margins in EISG.
Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you so much.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, Ron, Neil, and Satish. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess first on the order side, a two-part question. Great quarter for organic orders. You commented that commercial communications saw double-digit growth, reached the highest level since forming Keysight. But I'm curious if you could quantify that order growth rate a little more clearly. And then if we think about your revenue growth that you provided for the year, Neil, at 5% to 7%, and we think about double-digit order trends the last two quarters and accelerating order trends overall, can you help us understand I guess the disconnect between the order growth rate and revenue? Are you inferring that future order growth rate is going to decelerate below that 5% to 7% growth rate, or is there a lag effect because you have more software content? You already talked about the military orders having kind of longer duration. And I believe that your 5G orders are also tied more to long-term R&D relationships.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: So I'll take the second one of those first and then we'll come back to the order question. So as you start to think about hitting the 5% to 7% revenue growth for the year, and our first-half guide implied 4% core revenue growth. So we're definitely seeing accelerating revenue growth into the second half. But as you noted, we are seeing a lengthening of our order-to-revenue conversion cycle. If you look on our balance sheet, you'll see increasing deferred revenue balances as we have increasing both in the software and services base orders that have time-based revenue recognition. The solutions sale tends to have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle than the typical product sale. And as you mentioned within aerospace, defense, as we sell more systems and there are installation and customer sign-off requirements associated with those sales, that can also lengthen that period of time. So as we look at the course of the second half, we're definitely seeing a strong production ramp and a strong revenue ramp as we move from Q1 to Q2. As you go to the back half of the year, certainly the typical seasonality in this business is that you would see Q4 revenue being our strongest quarter of the year with Q3 being a relatively weaker point. At the high level, we think that that basic seasonality probably still continues, but it's probably muted a bit because of the strong backlog position, the production recovery that we're having. So we still see Q4 above Q3 but maybe with a slightly less of an increase given the strong backlog position that remains.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: And, Patrick, your question with regard to order growth, as was mentioned, we saw solid triple-digit order growth for 5G. But if you look at all of commercial comps, it was solid double-digit growth for orders. We're very pleased with that.
Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: All right. I was hoping for a finer point, but I'll give you a pass there. And then, Ron, I guess, nitpicking on kind of a negative. The overall business performed incredibly well, but the Ixia assets I think continue to underperform, whether it's related to growth targets in the proxy or consensus expectations prior to the acquisition. So can you help us understand whether the underperformance is all from the 100-gig slowdown in the core Layer 2, 3 test business, and how investors might think about that duration as 4G you already talked about is growing off of a small base? Or is this also visibility business that's seen some slowing growth as well because we've heard challenges from many of your competitors and I guess specifically on the visibility side, can you provide any revenue or order commentary? I didn't really hear any details in your prepared remarks.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'm going to turn this over to Mark Wallace in a second. So there's no doubt you did see some softness in 100G as you've seen in the competitor's results. We still had some overall solid growth, high-single-digit growth for ISG, which was nice to see. There's a lot of moving parts, as you know, when you pull the acquisition together. And on top of that, what we saw in the market situation that you've seen with our competitors, the public ones and the one that has recently gone private. But we're very pleased to see high-single-digit order growth right now. We're very pleased that we were able to integrate that. We're very pleased that we're on with our cost synergies. And we have no doubt that this is going to be a big valuable opportunity for us. And the high-single digit growth was revenue growth. Yeah.
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. And Patrick, this is Mark. I would add to that. We had growth in both orders and revenue in both test and visibility during the quarter. We saw a lot of increased activity in 400G where we're first to market. We're actually shipping a product. There is pricing pressure with the shift from 100G to 400G, but again the demand for 400G is picking up. For wireless and Wi-Fi, we expect to see continued demand for both 5G and next-generation Wi-Fi technologies. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated the industry's only integrated cellular and Wi-Fi protocol verification system. We also demonstrated the UE emulation system. These are all solutions that we've introduced since the acquisition. And on the visibility side, we saw growth across all customer segments, right from NEMS, the enterprise and service providers. So it's a good story.
Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you comment what are the...
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: And I just wanted to add one thing. That UE emulation and Wi-Fi solution combine technologies from both Keysight and Ixia, and so those are directly synergistic on the technical side between the two companies.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: And that's a very important point. One of the things that we saw when we were making the acquisition was the opportunity to bring these two technologies or the technologies of both companies together, and the fact that we're already doing that and doing that in the marketplace is strong. And with our new President, Mark Pierpoint, not only does he understand and know that market, he also knows Keysight very well. So he knows how to plug into the R&D organization. He has run the technology leadership organization that makes a lot of the high-performance integrated circuits and components. So he knows what capability we have, and that helps drive further revenue synergies as we go forward. Also knowing the organization, compared to someone from the outside, he knows how to get cost synergies by understanding the capabilities of both companies and where there is potential overlap. So we're very pleased with where we are right now. It's not perfect, but on the other hand, we're accelerating. And as far as your comment on the pass on orders, we don't report orders for commercial comps at that segment level.
Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then on that visibility side, can you just comment whether the revenue growth rate was single or double digits?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: No, we're not going to comment further on that.
Patrick Michael Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf from Barclays. Your line is open.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the 5G acceleration, and if you could go through some timing, meaning if these are lab orders moving into field, and what that means for product portfolio mix, breadth of customer base, and then if there is a pull-through into the ISG business as well? And how many quarters we can expect to see momentum in this business given what's going on in the end market?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Maybe Satish is best able to answer that given his proximity to those customers.
Satish Dhanasekaran - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Neil. I would say that the industry acceleration is real. I think those of us in Mobile World Congress got to witness it. And in terms of product SKUs, our customers are still in very early stages, right. So whether it's a base station or a chipset, you're probably still dealing with vintage to prototypes at this point that were on display. But these were very essential to prove that the technology can work and the early trials have really proven that. Having said that, what does this mean for our business. Our customers are having to tool up for 5G. In many cases, it's platforms that have to be upgraded to new equipment, as Ron referenced. And for Keysight, we also are participating in more test insertions in 5G than we've ever done before. The acquisitions of Anite and now and most lately Ixia gave us additional capability to offer a more comprehensive solution to our customers. So with all that, if you sum it all up, we see a clear runway for our solutions. Our collaborations with the lead customers indicate that their plans are not just a quarter or two, but they have a pretty solid roadmap and that bodes well for our future business.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then just to follow up on the cash and the taxes. If you're thinking about I guess the plan once from the spinoff and where you are with cash and the repatriation, does that cause you guys to rethink, accelerate, or keep where you were, any thought about dividends or buybacks?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So certainly the tax reform is definitely going to help us from an access to cash standpoint. Under the prior tax structure, we had access to about 25% of our cash in the U.S. With the move to the territorial-based system, we'd expect to have access to about 90-plus percent of our cash really anywhere that we want it. From a capital allocation standpoint, our number one priority continues to be the de-levering post the acquisition of Ixia. Obviously we added significant leverage to complete that transaction. I will be talking more about our thoughts on capital allocation at our Analyst Day next week. So look forward to sharing more at that point.
Joseph Wolf - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Excellent. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Hey, good evening, Ron, Neil. Hope you guys can hear me okay. I'm here in Germany so.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yes. No problem, Vijay.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah, perfect. So my question is around the mix shift to software and modular. It's obviously very important for investors. So anything you can do proactively, Ron, and Neil please chime in as well, in terms of product portfolio so that you can like engineer an outcome, no pun intended?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Well, there's no doubt that that's part of our overall strategy is to move to a business that was, let's say, less cyclical by moving out of manufacturing to R&D and to increase our recurring revenue. So as we look at the Ixia business, there's obviously more software there, some of it's still classified as being part of the instrument but there are application packs that are effectively are added to their instrumentation. And we've just unveiled a brand new software platform that encompasses the whole product development and all the way to operations lifecycle. And again this is a platform we'll be building on for years. It's more all-encompassing than anything that exists in the industry. It will also be able to take plug-ins from other people's software in certain areas. But whether or not you are going ahead and you are doing research and development, or whether or not you're doing operations, you'll be able to tie those results together to save time. That will help our software portfolio. As I mentioned earlier, our software grew double-digits and we are continuing to accelerate that. Services is a relatively small part of our business, as you know it's less than 15%, but we still see a great opportunity for that. But again, we're not going to waste cash and overpay for acquisitions. We'll take our time and build it ourselves. But that will also help us as we move to recurring revenue. But the move to R&D and the move to software will continue to help us on the gross margin line.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. A quick follow-on for Neil. Now with the strength you're seeing in 5G testing and also in ADAS connected cars, there's a tendency for management to overspend to capture the momentum in the business. How should we think about OpEx through the rest of the year? Thanks.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I mean I think we feel like we're investing in R&D at the right level today, about 15% of revenue. I think however, we are managing differently in that we are keeping our foot on the gas here and making sure that we continue to make the investments that are necessary to win in these areas where we're seeing technology inflection, 5G and automotive being the two best examples. And so, we don't see at this point a material change in the way we're investing either up or down, we're going to continue to invest at more or less the model that we've been using for the past year or so.
Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Your line is open.
Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start off just asking a little bit about the overall industry landscape. There's been some M&A in your space. One of your competitors acquired a business related to RAM testing. Can you help us understand just how you guys fit in from a competitive landscape perspective and some of the portfolio areas? Ron, especially you mentioned how you've invested in 5G and through portfolio expansion as well versus 4G? But a little bit more color on market position and differentiation will be great.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Our strategy of differentiation is based around providing solutions. We not only provide hardware and we have the fab that goes ahead and creates high-performance components and makes high-performance measurements to provide great, let's just say, measurement integrity. But we also provide software and we are the largest software provider. But with our new platform that we'll be expanding over years, we're going to be continuing to take that further. But the third part of our overall solution is our people. We have the most technical depth not only because of our size but because of the numbers of years we've been in the core part of our market. When you look at the wireless market that's infiltrating everything from automotive to everything that we see in our communications group, that's an area where customers come to us for solutions, whether it's helping with standards or whether it's devising solutions or consulting before the sale, during the sale, and after the sale. So our big differentiation is providing solutions in our key markets. We're not going to overpay for an acquisition and get an acquisition or do an acquisition that won't return above the cost of capital and we're going to do everything we can to further differentiation in total solutions. And when we provide those solutions, we're helping our customers really get to market more quickly and beat their competition and be very, very effective in the marketplace. So we have a robust M&A process and we look at that. Right now, our priority is on making sure we are successful with Ixia. We have Anite. We've integrated that and we're winning a lot of R&D 5G business due to the components and the parts of the solutions from Anite, as well as from the rest of the company. And in Ixia, we just completed the integration into our systems in nine months and we've expanded our SAM and we're going much further. We've also done other acquisitions which also help us, such as we said our stated goal was to win in automotive. So we made an acquisition of Scienlab, and we're very, very pleased with that. That was the firm in Germany that was mentioned earlier today on the call, but we will do small M&As. But right now, we are focused on making the investments that we made pay off even greater than we thought and delevering.
Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks. And when we look at specifically the international businesses, particularly I'm thinking of Europe in communications and Japan in communications, is this just a function of this 4G spending versus 5G? Where are those regions in terms of testing for 5G? And how does the trajectory of the recovery there look like? And then I also wanted to ask a follow up to Neil on margins. When we look at the outlook for the first half versus your prior outlook for the first half, it looks like the $0.03 higher at the midpoint could be coming from tax reform. How should we think about where margins should wind up in the first half relative to your prior expectations? I know you're investing in the business, especially on OpEx. And then looking out into the second half of the year, if you can help us with the operating leverage there. Thanks.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: I'll answer the first question very quickly. We have seen growth in most all the regions; for instance, our core growth factoring out Ixia and other acquisitions as well as currency, which is embedded in everybody's numbers at this time. Americas was up double-digits, Asia Pacific and Japan, both of them were up very high single-digits and Europe was close to flat. But, overall, our core growth was 16%. So we see growth across basically all of the regions with – Europe was a little bit flat on a core basis.
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: So, this is Mark. I'll just add on communications specifically. We see 5G demand coming across all the regions. The 4G business is stabilizing because there are investments being made in 4.5G and 4.9G, especially around components and base station, so those two combined together to give us the outcome that Ron just talked about.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, and then this is Neil to address your question on margins. Obviously we've had – our revenues and shipments are a bit more volatile here in the first half than you would typically expect given what's going on with production. But as I noted in the guide, the guidance that we provided for the half does deliver 4% core growth and it delivers a core incremental that is above 40%, which is our promised incremental on core growth. And so as you think about these, you think about modeling margins for the second half I would anchor on that. We've talked about second half core growth in the 5% to 7% range for the full year. So obviously off of – with 4% in the first half, we'll be growing at better than that in the second half and focused on meeting that 40% incremental. We also from a margin perspective in the second half see significant improvement from the Ixia cost synergies. So we have some that are in the run rate now but it was really this integration into the ERP that is the big triggering mechanism to allow us to start taking cost out of Ixia. And so we'll be doing a lot of that work this quarter such that by Q3 we're at a $10 million per quarter run rate or $40 million annually for Ixia synergies.
Stanley Kovler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason from Baird. Your line is open.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yes, good afternoon. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I did want to ask about the semiconductor business. Ron, I think you had noted maybe some difference in the products there, but strong in the quarter, but I'm curious what the outlook is for that business, how the backlog may look there?
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: So, Rob, this is Mark, I'll answer the outlook. We have a broad business really in semiconductor. And in the quarter, we saw a strong demand for some of our nano-positioning tools and solutions, as Neil mentioned. And we saw a seasonal decline in the parametric wafer test part of the business as a lot of our customers in the fabs are in the process of utilizing a lot of capacity they purchased last year. Looking forward, we expect to continue to capture growth from investments occurring in China, and that's going to carry over for many years ahead. And we see other opportunities around memory as an example continuing into the second half and beyond. So, the broad nature of our business, I think we're well-positioned. There are some mix shifts over time.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Sure. Okay. And then, just maybe following up on your comments earlier around 4G that business stabilizing. I think you had noted that even the prior quarter it grew some, but with the pool end that you're now seeing within 5G, is there a point as you look out over the next year or two where that tips and works against you at a more accelerated rate?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Satish, you want to take that question on how we see the transition from 4G to 5G occurring.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: We may have lost Satish, so.
Satish Dhanasekaran - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. I'm here. Sorry. I'm here, Neil. Yes, a very good observation. Last few quarters, we've observed a pretty stabilizing trend in the 4G business driven by 4G enhancements, so that provided the stability that you referenced. As we move forward with 5G, there's two flavors, the non-standalone and standalone. The non-standalone version, we continue to see a lot of innovation occurring with 4G. And there's also automotive use cases coming in C-V2X and other new features along with IoT capabilities which will be first deployed on 4G. So I feel reasonably okay about where 4G is headed. But if you fast forward 10 years from now, maybe you will see the trend that you describe, but it's hard to see in the immediate near-term that there could be a complete turn off of 4G; although there are parts of the businesses that might be experiencing that.
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: And Satish, I'll just add one. This is Mark. One thing I will say is that the breadth of 5G is very different than 4G. So we're seeing growth in the areas that you mentioned and over-the-air testing and millimeter wave. But on the on the EDGE, we're also seeing continued growth for 400G PAM-4 on the digital side. So I think that's going to combine to be a very different scenario than what we saw in 4G.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you, that's very helpful. Maybe just real quick, Neil, one last question. How did your currencies assumption for the first half change versus the prior guide?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Over the first half, we're seeing about a 2-point favorable impact from currency on the revenue line, but it's profit neutral. Our expenses are up almost dollar-for-dollar so they were profit neutral. And about half of that currency impact has occurred just over the last three months .So, if we were making – when we called the first half a quarter ago, it was about 1-point favorable on the revenue line and now we're up to 2 points favorable on the revenue line.
Rob W. Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Operator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Jason Kary, I turn the call back over to you.
Jason A. Kary - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: All right. Very good. Thank you very much for being on the call today. And we'll look forward to speaking with and seeing many of you next week at our Investor Day. Thank you and have a great day.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We will focus today’s discussion on three key topics. First, we delivered an outstanding fourth quarter across the board. In total, orders grew 27% year-over-year to reach a record of over $1 billion, with core orders increasing 11%. We achieved 20% revenue growth and generated 20% operating margin and EPS of $0.71, which was $0.07 above the midpoint of our guidance and $0.02 above the high-end. Second, our continued focus and commitment throughout the year generated strong results. We have continued to build momentum in key growth areas across multiple end markets, contributing to three consecutive quarters of accelerating core order growth. And third, our success this year demonstrates that our strategy is delivering results. We are well aligned with the needs of our customers and we have a strong foundation to drive growth in earnings in 2018 and beyond. Let’s begin with a review of Keysight’s very strong fourth quarter performance. We achieved earnings of $0.71 per share, exceeding the high-end of our guidance. We grow orders by 27% to surpass $1 billion, a new record for Keysight, and grew revenue by 20%, or 3% on a core basis. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter performance and execution, resulting in an outstanding close to a transformative year for Keysight. Beyond the numbers, we believe our execution in the fourth quarter is even more meaningful when considering the unimaginable challenges our team faced with the Santa Rosa wildfires in October. Personally, I’m proud of how the Keysight team came together to help the community and each other to navigate through this challenging time, as well as deliver a strong quarter. I’m inspired by their resiliency, acts of courage and generosity. I’d like to thank each and every member of the Keysight worldwide team for their unwavering support, as well as thank all of our partners, customers and investors. Our Santa Rosa headquarters did incur some damage and was temporarily closed as it was in a mandatory evacuation zone, which did have an impact on our operations. Neil will discuss the specifics shortly, but I would highlight that Keysight is a global company with global operations and our business performance worldwide remains strong. Our record fourth quarter resulted in a strong finish to the fiscal year with total order growth of 15%, or 7% core growth and total revenue growth of 11%, or 2% core. With our strong 2017 order performance, we are exiting the year with a strong backlog and a solid foundation to build upon as we move into 2018. As we look to our markets, we continue to see increased investments in emerging technologies and overall healthy dynamics. Our strong results throughout the year demonstrate that our strategy is driving growth. We have focused on partnering with customers early and bringing solutions to market that enable them to validate and accelerate their designs. As a result, we are building momentum in key segments of the market that are undergoing technology transformations, such as 5G, next-generation Wi-Fi, electronic warfare, high-speed data centers and automotive and energy. We are seeing excellent adoption of our solutions, including software. Orders for our software solutions grew in the high single digits for the year to reach over $450 million, excluding Ixia. Keysight is at the heart of innovation processes in many dynamic end markets. Today, I will highlight the trends we see in 5G, auto and energy, as well as aerospace and defense. 5G networks and devices will explore uncharted territory in frequency coverage, data rates, number of simultaneous users, spectral efficiency and reduced latency. This will allow providers to introduce new and potentially game-changing business models. Our early engagement with leading market makers and solutions-based go-to-market strategy have advanced Keysight to a leadership position. Orders for our 5G solutions grew to a new record in Q4, and we delivered high double-digit growth for the year. This is an area, where we continue to invest in our partnerships and solutions in order to strengthen our position as the marketplace develops. We have teamed up with multiple industry leaders to successfully demonstrate industry-first achievements that are important milestones towards making 5G commercialization a reality. By leveraging our core strengths in our acquisitions of Anite and AT4 Wireless, we have developed groundbreaking solutions and established a leadership position in 5G. Auto and energy is another key area, where we are building momentum as technology advancements transform the market. Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for four consecutive quarters. While there are several trends driving development activities across multiple dimensions at once in this end market, including the increasing content of electric vehicles, electric and hybrid power cars and radar technologies for autonomous driving. Autonomous driving in itself encompasses the spectrum of technologies. At one end, there are driver assisted features that include lane centering, parallel parking and collision avoidance. At the most advanced end, there’s the next generation vehicle with full self-driving capabilities, which will need multiple sensors, high power computing, artificial intelligence and communications infrastructure to support real-time information flow. With this broad development landscape, we believe we will see continued R&D investments in auto and energy for many years to come. Accordingly, we’re intensifying our focus on this key growth area and investing to expand our presence. We introduced over 70 new solutions for the auto and energy market since October of last year. Just last month, we opened an Automotive Solution Center in the Detroit area that features an electronic test and measurement lab, a training facility and a fully equipped vehicle test bay, which complements our automotive solution centers in Germany, Silicon Valley and other strategic locations. Additionally, we recently expanded our auto and energy solutions offerings with our acquisitions of Scienlab, which is based in Germany and serves a Tier 1 customer base. This acquisition strategically expands our global footprint and solutions portfolio, allowing end-to-end solutions for hybrid and electric vehicles and battery test solutions. In the aerospace and defense end market, electronic warfare is defending against malicious actors looking to take advantage of security gaps in electronic and digital communications are growing in importance. Aerospace and defense technologies need to keep advancing in order to stay ahead of commercially available technology evolutions. And this is driving innovation across multiple dimensions. For example, in communications, new breakthrough frequency domains need to be explored. Additionally, aerospace and defense needs to be on the cutting-edge of software-defined radios, future generations of satellite communications and private mobile Ad-Hoc Networks. Keysight provides the industry’s most advanced electronic warfare and radar testing solutions and has been a longstanding leader in this market. While delayed budget approvals in the U.S. impacted our aerospace and defense growth in the first three quarters of 2017, we exited the year with strong Q4 aerospace defense orders growing 20% year-over-year. The timing of annual budget approvals is always a concern. However, over the long-term, we remain bullish on both our market position in aerospace and defense and the prospect for increasing U.S. defense spending. In closing, our clear vision, continued focus and commitment led to our strong results for the quarter and the year. We have consistently delivered on our commitments and are very pleased with our steady progress to transform and position Keysight for growth. We’re executing on our strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders and driving growth across multiple avenues of emerging technology trends. This year, we continue to increase investments in R&D, while expanding our technology portfolio and market inorganically with several acquisitions. We believe these investments already delivering results and are well aligned with growing market trends, where customers are investing in next generation digital and electronic technologies. We’re poised to continue to drive growth in earnings, as these long-term trends evolve and look forward to sharing our progress with you along the way. With that, I will turn the call over to Neil for a detailed review of our financial performance and outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today, we reported fourth quarter GAAP revenue of $878 million and non-GAAP revenue of $902 million, which excludes the impact of the acquisition-related fair value adjustments to Ixia’s deferred revenue balance. Core revenue, which excludes the impact of currency and revenue from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months grew 3% year-over-year and core orders grew 11%. Regionally, order growth was strong across all geographies, whereas core revenue declined 3% in the Americas and grew 6% in Europe, 11% in Japan and 7% in the rest of Asia. Looking at our operational results, gross margin was 61.9%, a year-over-year increase of 440 basis points, driven by favorable core product mix and the addition of Ixia. For the quarter, operating expenses totaled $377 million, compared with $290 million in the same period last year, reflecting the addition of Ixia and ongoing R&D and sales investments. This resulted in fourth quarter operating margin of 20.1%, up from 18.9% last year. We reported net income of $135 million, up 22% over last year and $0.71 in earnings per share, which was $0.02 above the high-end of our guidance range. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 189 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communication Solutions Group or CSG includes two primary end markets versus the commercial communications end market that reported revenue of $280 million, up 10% compared with last year’s fourth quarter, driven by R&D solutions for new technologies, including 5G, 4.9G LTE-Advanced and Wi-Fi test. CSG also includes our aerospace, defense and government end markets, which generated revenue of $182 million in Q4, compared with $188 million in the same quarter last year. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $462 million, or 4% growth was 62.9% gross margin and 21.3% operating margin. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group or EISG generated fourth quarter revenue of $206 million, up 3% from last year. Automotive and energy led the growth, followed closely by general electronics measurement. EISG reported gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 21.8%. Our Ixia Solutions Group generated revenue of $124 million, gross margin of 76.2% and an operating margin of 16.4%. ISG revenue was above the level implied in our guidance for the quarter. ISG saw solid demand for its high-speed Ethernet test solutions, including 400 gig and strong orders for its security and application solutions. Additionally, visibility sales with service provider customers were strong, offset by softness and enterprise accounts. Lastly, the Services Solutions Group or SSG revenue grew 2% year-over-year to reach $110 million. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales for both calibration and remarketed solutions. This brings our SSG revenue for the year to $419 million, up 4% over last year. In the fourth quarter, SSG reported gross margin of 42.6% and operating margin of 16.3%. As Ron highlighted, overall, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2017 fiscal year. Revenue for the year totaled $3.2 billion and gross margin improved 230 basis points to 60.0%. To fuel innovation and strengthen our market position in strategic areas, we continue to invest in R&D and made several acquisitions. At the same time, we remain within our operating model, delivering 19.1% operating margin and reporting non-GAAP net income after-taxes of $462 million, or $2.53 per share. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fiscal year 2017 with $818 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $873 million last quarter. Our quarter-end cash balance reflects a $40 million pay down of our term loan, $60 million of net cash used for the acquisition of Scienlab and a $68 million payment for a Malaysian tax liability, which we continue to actively dispute. We generated $64 million in cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter and invested $18 million in capital purchases. This brings our free cash flow for the quarter to $46 million. Turning to our outlook and guidance. We are encouraged by the healthy market dynamics, strong order growth and increased backlog we saw in the fourth quarter, as well as our strong funnel of future opportunities. However, as Ron noted, Keysight was impacted by the Northern California wildfires. Our headquarters was under mandatory evacuation for more than three weeks and while direct fire damage to our core facilities was limited. Especially when compared to the immediate surrounding area, our buildings did experience some smoke and other fire-related environmental impacts. Since regaining access to our site, our focus has been on returning manufacturing to full production. Over the intermediate term, we expect the fire to have no net impact on our business results, but the disruption will impact the seasonality of revenue in the next few quarters. For this reason, we are taking the unusual step of focusing our guidance on the first-half of FY 2018. For the first-half of the year, we currently expect non-GAAP revenue to be approximately $1.775 billion, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.29, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 190 million shares and a non-GAAP tax rate of 17%. As we look at the expected seasonality within the half, we currently expect first quarter non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $780 million to $820 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.29 to $0.43. Assuming Q1 performance at the midpoint, the balance of $975 million of revenue and $0.93 of EPS will end in Q2 to reach our guidance for the first-half of non-GAAP revenue of $1.775 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.29. As Ron mentioned in his opening remarks, we have built a strong foundation and remain confident in our ability to drive revenue and earnings growth in 2018, while continuing to create value for our customers. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Kiersten, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, thanks. I hope, you guys can hear me, okay.
Ron Nersesian: Yes, Vijay, no problem.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, excellent. Yes, hi, Ron and Neil. So, we wish you all the well with the fire damage recovery. My question is, you don’t guide for the full-year, but give us kind of qualitative color if you could on some of the big growth areas for next year, which would be around 5G testing, also industrial IoT, semi testing and the like. So that we get a qualitative demand picture from you for the full-year? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: Sure. If you take a look at Q4, our 5G orders were over 50% – had 50% growth. And for the year, it was in the upper double-digits north of 50%. So we continue to see very strong 5G demand. We're winning business that we didn’t win in 4G by combining not only the new innovations at Keysight, but also combining those with innovations from Anite and AT4 wireless, which is why we did those two acquisitions. Aerospace defense, while for the year the orders were roughly flat, accelerated and had 20% growth in Q4. Now if you remember Q1 of last year, Q1 was very light. So we would anticipate strong order growth for aerospace defense in Q1. We also see an accelerating picture in overall commercial communications, which includes 5G, where we saw a double-digit growth in the quarter. Our automotive and energy growth initiative had 18% growth in Q4 and over 20% growth for fiscal year 2017. And we think that that is another long-term trend. And the last thing that I’ll mention is modular. So when you compare us to some of the other players in the industries, our modular growth for the year was – for orders was 18%, and it even accelerated, where Q4 was over 20%. So looking at all these factors when you look at 5G, when you look at commercial communications and other wireless, if you look at automotive and energy, if you look at our progress in software, if you look at our building modular base, that’s why we feel very confident in guiding for the half. Also, you probably have noticed that we built up a good bit of backlog and we’ll be burning that, burning bunch – a bunch of that backlog off in the first-half. Yes, we’re going to shift our seasonality. Q1 will be a little lighter and Q2 will be a little heavier. But we’re very confident with our backlog and our market positions that will be able to meet or exceed our half one guidance.
Vijay Bhagavath: Certainly, it’s truly helpful. A quick follow-on for Neil. Software and modular in terms of product mix is one of the stories on the stock. So question for you Neil is, the improvement in software and modular in the product mix, when could it start it impacting the gross margin line, would it be first-half, or closer to the second-half of next year? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: You did see a 440 basis point increase in our gross margin in FY 2017. Now some of that was driven by the addition of Ixia, which is obviously the high gross margin business. But we also saw a favorable mix shift within the core business, driven by the types of things that you’re talking about, not only the increase, the above average growth rate of our software and modular businesses, but also the continued migration of our revenue towards more of our customers R&D labs and away from their manufacturing line. So I think, you are seeing that already, and I think you will continue to see it as we move forward.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Your line is open.
Stanley Kovler: Hi, good afternoon. [Indiscernible] as well to the team on the ground and the recovery efforts. So I wanted to ask you guys just in terms of the outlook for the first-half. Can you help us understand what safeguards you might have for orders that you’ve secured just given the seasonality and concerns around potential customer cancellations or things like that? And then I just have a quick follow-up.
Ron Nersesian: Sure. Well, first of all, we had a lot of calls from our customers asking what they could do to help us, which was very rewarding and we’ve gone out and talked to all of them. When you’re talking about $100 million shift, you’re talking about two weeks worth of shipments for our company. It’s not that big. It’s not that big in the grand scheme of things. But we have worked with every customer. We’ve realized exactly when they need their products. Most of them are getting them and the ones that aren’t, we’re basically prioritizing for folks that could accept products two to three weeks later. So we’re in. We feel very comfortable with that. Also as the incoming order rate has been high, as you’ve heard the 11% organic growth for the quarter and you see our market position and our ability to win over the competition, we feel very strongly about the guidance and our ability to preserve customers.
Stanley Kovler: Thanks. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask you just in terms of the tax reform implications. What does it mean for you guys? Have you tried to quantify it on earnings basis, or the potential to repatriate some of your cash from overseas? Would – in that scenario, would you prioritize deleveraging M&A, cash return? How should we think about that? Thanks a lot. Good luck.
Ron Nersesian: Sure. Well, thank you, Stanley. First of all, obviously, if the tax reform does go through, which I think everybody expects, it will go through in one form or the other. That would make a very, very large percentage of our cash accessible to us at the exact same tax rate or very, very close. So we’re excited about that. That gives us more leverage. That’s been one of the things in the longer-term that makes it hard to give back cash to our investors in the form of share buybacks or in dividends. But that constraint will be released. Our first priority is to delever roughly $550 million after the acquisition of Ixia. We’ve already delevered by hundreds of millions of dollars. We’ll continue to meet our commitments and do that, but this opens up the opportunity in the future to have a Board decision on how and – if and how we return cash to the shareholders.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, I don’t have a ton to add, maybe just a couple of comments. So first Id just make note of a statement that I made in my prepared remarks about modeling a 17% tax rate for the first-half of the year. And that’s based on the integration work we’ve done for Ixia to-date, and that is pre any tax reform. And so we’re already ahead of where we expected to be with regard to taxes post the acquisition of Ixia. As Ron has mentioned, the biggest benefit we see from the potential tax reform is the access to capital that it could provide. Obviously, the reduction in the U.S. tax rate that’s being proposed to approximately 20%. We see as being net favorable for growth and should have a positive impact on our end markets, but the biggest direct impact for us is access to capital. The number one priority will be to hit the approximately $240 million from incremental delevering that we have to do. We’ve got a plan in place to do that with or without tax reform, and then we can talk about the priority there. We then begin to start return cash to shareholders.
Stanley Kovler: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Stanley.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Newton: Yes, good afternoon, Ron and Neil. First off, I guess, my condolences to those in the Keysight family that experienced loss in the Santa Rosa fire. Jumping into the questions, I guess, Neil, can you elaborate a little bit more on the half-year guidance? I can absolutely understand how fires disrupted seasonal trends and deliveries near-term. But I’m hoping for a little more detail on how this may impact seasonality in the back-half of the year or visibility in the back-half of the year? And are you implying the effects of the fire are greater in out quarters? Meaning that maybe some of the smoke damage could have some shipment shortages or impacts from longer-term? And then Ron, along the same lines thinking out longer-term, I think, last quarter, you talked about EPS growth approximating 10% in FY 2018. And I’m wondering if there’s any change to that expectation?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. I’ll start with the end. No, there’s no change to what we had said about EPS growth. Overall, for the year, for 2018, we expect there to be no net impact at all from the fire. But just to put it in context, we had 119 employees who did lose their owns. So it has been a pretty big effort here, and we had to make sure that our employees not only tended to the company, but also could tend to their families. But right now, we already have 90% of our Santa Rosa facility – operations facility up and running. And that’s only a fraction of the total manufacturing that we have in the company. We have to do some cleaning and calibration of some equipment and things like that. But we’re very pleased to where we are. We’re actually ahead of where we expected to be at this point.
Neil Dougherty: Yes, as it relates to guidance, at this point, we don’t have any significant concerns about our ability to get product to customers. Again, we’re working actively with them to communicate to them what our delivery schedules are like and we’re working to accelerate recovery from the production disruption as quickly as possible. I think, as you look at the first-half, we expect to be mostly whole by the end of the first-half. There are some small lingering amounts that carry into Q3 in terms of catch up, but those numbers are relatively small. And then certainly by Q4, we’re back to normal seasonality. So we really see the disruption is over the next three quarters, but really what you’re seeing is primarily a shift from Q1 into Q2 with some small amounts lingering into Q3 and back to normal by Q4. It is not right now impacting incoming orders in anyway. And as Ron has said, our customers have been very, very gracious, I guess, and asking what they can do to help us through this period of difficulty.
Ron Nersesian: And if you take a look at the total effect, as Neil said, we’re going to ship less in Q1 and more in Q2. Outside of that, there may be, we’re talking some roughly $30 million that may linger into Q3, but our goal is to obviously make that zero. We’re not saying that, we can do that yet. We’ll make sure that we can get that done before we’d make a public commitment. Also, just let you know, we’re here at the Santa Rosa site right now during this conference call with you. And it’s great to see all of our operations people here and really charged up at helping the company and how fast we’ve been up. We have hundreds of machines here. And every single one of our machines and everything is, there is no damage to them that we found. So things, we’re very pleased with how things have progressed since the fires have stopped.
Patrick Newton: I appreciate the details. And I guess, the CSG and EISG segments both performing quite well. So I did kind of want to nitpick on your services side with core growth of 0%. If we kind of back up to your Analyst Day you had been targeting an 8% CAGR in services. And I believe, it’s – or $600 million revenue target by 2020. I’m curious as to how you reaccelerate growth and how we should think about that longer-term target for hitting that $600 million in service revenue?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. Good question, Patrick. First of all, let me just make a statement. First, when we went ahead and we said we were going to get to that 8% growth for services, we anticipated doing acquisitions to putting capability in certain areas and then to leverage that new capability and quickly expand and grow. What we found is that the acquisitions that were out there with the prices and the prices demanded by the companies that were selling really did not provide a good return to Keysight shareholders. So we’ve decided to build some of that capability as opposed to buying the capability and just adding to it. It’s a much better return for the shareholders, but it will take a little longer to get to that numbers. But I’m going to let John talk a little bit about the progress that has been made and what he plans to do.
John Page: Sure. Thanks for the question, Patrick. Yes, so overall, the SSG segment showed 4% growth for the year, which is actually a record revenue number for SSG ever. Q4 was building on that traction and that was an all-time record for our quarter four revenue as well. So we continue to gain traction. We’re as confident as ever about the long-term direction of the services business and the opportunity that exists there. As Ron mentioned, part of the plan was always to have inorganic sprinkled in with organic growth to enable certain capabilities and accelerate growth in certain portions around the world. The opportunities to find good targets at reasonable prices has been harder than we thought. So that that has have to shift to a more of an organic methodology to hit those growth numbers. But we’re very confident about it, and we see the areas that we’re really focused on with multi-vendor managed services growing strongly with our remarketing organization, growing strongly with the reaction from customers to these offerings and expanding on what they’re asking Keysight to do for them being very strong as well. So it’s a good story. It’s just going to take a little bit longer than we had originally expected when we expected more M&A activity.
Patrick Newton: Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Let me just also put that into context. Overall, with Keysight, we remain committed to the model that we talked about before. We talked about in September of 2015 and three to four years getting to a 4% growth and 40% incrementals. We see a very clear path to get to that model early and deliver that in FY 2018. As you know, the four quarters of – in the four quarters of FY 2017, our core growth accelerated from 2% to 4% to 7% to 11% core growth. And with all of that, there are some puts and takes. Some of the growth initiatives are running a little bit harder than we expect most of them, and we’re able to make up for that that services gap.
Patrick Newton: Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: And our next question comes from line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I kind of just wanted to ask Vijay’s question in a different way. You had stronger than seasonal growth in orders in the fourth quarter much stronger than anytime you have had impact. So can you just talk about relative to the – what you see the seasonal trends, which are the areas when you see – saw very strong growth?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. I mean, our order growth was very strong across the board in the fourth quarter. We saw order growth across all geographies. We saw order growth across all of our end segments. We saw a pretty strong rebound in aerospace defense, Ron mentioned that in his script, 20% growth –the order growth in aerospace defense, which offset the sharp decline we saw earlier in this fiscal year. We saw a very strong growth in 5G, a very strong growth in modular software growth.
Neil Dougherty: Auto…
Ron Nersesian: Yes, auto and energy, semi orders were up. Commercial communications, it was a very, very broad based across virtually all end markets, all geographies, very strong end markets. And we really feel, it’s driven by our strong market position and really the decisions we’ve made multiple years ago to identify these market opportunities and invest.
Mark Wallace: Yes, and this is Mark Wallace. Just to add to that, we’ve gone through all the industries as was noted a 11% core order growth with positive order growth in every single region. And when you start to look at the breakdown of customers, we saw double-digit order growth with our largest customers. These are the same industry leaders that we’re engaging with early on developing new solutions. And by the way, these engagements are sustaining when we start down a path around some new technology development. It creates additional opportunities for us to continue to work with them. So our largest customers were up 20%. And as you may recall, earlier in the year, we put an emphasis on our capability in digital marketing and increasing our front-line sales capacity. So our smallest customers, our emerging accounts and the long tail of customers was also up double-digit during the quarter as well. So just to reiterate what Neil said, our results are very strong and well-balanced.
Ron Nersesian: Nice thing about this is, these aren’t things that happened just by chance. These are literally the programs that we put in place. The growth initiatives we identified three years ago that we focused on, as well as the sales and marketing programs that we focused on and that’s where we’re seeing very strong results.
Farhan Ahmad: And you also talked about modular growing very strongly for you this year. Can you just talk about what are some of the factors, which is driving your modular business to be so much stronger than some of the others in the industry?
Ron Nersesian: Well, I think a lot of the modular business is also in the wireless business or 5G and even 4G. And our strength and our differentiation in the wireless area from our decades and decades of expertise helps us solve problems that we will say some other companies may get stuck with. And when we go head-to-head, we win a very, very high percentage of the time. So we’re starting to see modular in that area, but it’s not at the expense, where we’re losing one box solution sales to the point where we’re not getting any growth. When you add them together, we’re still getting a 11% organic growth in Q4. So we’re very pleased with that. What’s happening is, some people are trying to move towards 5G or wireless, and we were moving towards modular and we’re clearly winning.
Farhan Ahmad: Got it. Thank you. That’s all I have.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon.
Ron Nersesian: Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, would love to hop back to the aerospace and defense business and sort of get your qualitative comments on how the U.S. is trending, whether you saw the U.S. orders turn the corner, recognizing that revenue was still down year-over-year, but overall, so much better if you kind of say, we turn the corner in the U.S.?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. So I’ll let Mark talk about the budget process and where we are and what it needs, but we’re very pleased with the 20% order growth in Q4. Obviously, if you look at where the compare is for Q1, we expect to see some nice growth numbers in Q1. But I’ll let Mark talk through the budget process that leads us to be very confident in where we are.
Mark Wallace: Yes. Thanks, Ron. Hi, Brandon. So, we had a very strong Q4 20% order growth. And this was predicted back in the early part of the year, as we saw the change of administration. So it really happened the way we thought it would. And where we find ourselves today, as we all know, is we’re waiting for the budget to be signed if the deadline is coming up later this week. So that means there’s a high likelihood. There will be a push out, a delay, which means probably some continuing resolution probably into the first couple months of the next calendar year, because it doesn’t allow for new program starts, it may have some short-term impact. But again, we’re operating on last year’s budget as part of continuing resolution. And it’s very likely that a budget will be approved in 2018 probably for multi-year and it’s believed with bipartisan support that it will include a sizable U.S. Department of Defense increase, which is beneficial to Keysight because of our strong position in the U.S. DOD. So, what I’d summarize is that, we have very strong customer relationships in this segment. We have a leading position with new technology development and deployment like electronic warfare that Ron mentioned in his opening comments. We have a very robust funnel. And therefore, our outlook over the medium and long-term for aerospace defense is very strong.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. And one for Neil. In terms of the fourth quarter cash flow, free cash flow conversion was a little bit lighter than I guess we would have thought. As we look out to 2018, I think the outsized pension outlays that you’ve been absorbing last couple of years, I think those are supposed to expire. Are there any other one-timers or headwinds that we should think about as we sort of think about the full-year next year and perhaps some expectation that conversion can improve from here?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So a couple of comments. So first of all, as you look at FY 2017, or excuse me, Q4, you’re right, our cash – our free cash flow was lower in the quarter. And the primary driver of that was this Malaysian tax payment that we need to bake. Again, we’re continuing to actively dispute that. We believe the facts very much line up favorably for us and hopefully that will ultimately be resolved to our benefit, but those things can take time. I think, as you look forward to FY 2018, first of all know that cash flow conversion is an area of focus for us. We will continue to see some additional pension funding requirements as we move forward. I think, the other thing that we will continue to be a bit of a drag on cash flow, at least, through the first-half is the remainder of the Ixia integration. And as we look to realize the synergies associated with that acquisition, again, we’ve committed to deliver $10 million per quarter by Q3 of next year and we’re on track to do that. But there will be some cash costs associated with recognizing those synergies. I think once we get beyond that, we’re going to be in a much better position to start converting profit to cash flow in a more aggressive fashion and narrowing the gap between our overall levels of profitability and cash flow.
Ron Nersesian: I’ll just add that, as Neil mentioned, the Malaysian tax issue, we believe our case is very, very strong. And unfortunately, with the Malaysian government, the way that it works is you pay upfront before you have your day in court, if you will, where – which is not the case in other regions of the world. So if it works out the way that we think, we could see a reversal of that cash position.
Brandon Couillard: Okay. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Brandon.
Operator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Ron or Neil, could you perhaps bracket maybe what the core growth might look like first-half versus second-half of 2018? And the math – my math kind of suggest that maybe core growth is 3% or a little shy of that in the first-half. And then it seems like it would need to pick up in the second-half, but you’re going to have tougher comps. So maybe you can just walk us through maybe the timing there?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. Thanks, Rick. We deliberately didn’t break down the guidance for the first-half between core and non-core. The reality is, we’ve got an awful lot of moving pieces more so than usual here as we move through the first-half. We’re very confident in our ability to get to that first-half number that we put out there, but we haven’t broken it down any further. I think, as you look at the full-year, as Ron mentioned, we see a clear path to get to the long-term operating model for the year of delivering 4% core growth with 40% incremental. And so, as you think about the year, I think, we expect to do at least that well, but we haven’t broken it down here for the first-half.
Richard Eastman: And can I – just in the mix there, can I ask you has any of the revenue outlook for Ixia, has that moved around a bit? In other words, it sounds like the core order growth here heading into fiscal 2018 is stronger. Is my sense correct that maybe a little bit of Ixia revenue falls out, maybe business conditions weaker. I think, you mentioned enterprise visibility weaker, and offsetting that might be a bit of an acceleration in core growth?
Neil Dougherty: Last quarter, we talked about the relative market weakness that Ixia was seeing. And to some extent that is continuing. That being said, Q4 was better than what we had modeled into our guidance three months ago for Ixia. So, yes, at the margin, things are a little bit better than they were three months ago for Ixia. And they tend to be seasonally very strong in the fourth calendar quarter, and so we’re going through that period right now. But we definitely haven’t seen any deterioration of the Ixia end markets over the last two months, if anything they’re a little bit better at the margins, but we have an awful lot of backlog over the course of the last year. We feel like we’re very well-positioned going into the end of the fiscal year, especially on a core basis, where as you noted, orders have grown to 11% the most recent quarter.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just last question for me then I’m sorry. The – within the EISG business, how did the semi business, parametric test business do in the quarter? I mean, I presume you’re lapping some pretty heavy big comps. And what’s your outlook there and maybe the trend line look like in the – on the semi test side?
Ron Nersesian: I’ll just say in the semi test side, we saw double-digit order growth, which was very good. It’s funny. It’s very hard to predict. We always say, oh, this is the last quarter we’re going to get orders and we keep hitting double digit numbers. But again, when you look at it as a total of our business, it’s less than 10% of our total business. So we have the ability to buffer that a bit. I’ll turn over to Mark for some other comments.
Mark Wallace: Yes, just – I’ll just add to that. The blistering growth that we saw in the first-half from a lot of the fabs building capacity and upgrading their process for a lot of the products that are shipping now with smart devices, smartphones, they’re moving into a production kind of mode versus the investment. But as we’ve spoken about, I think, many times on these calls, the opportunities in China with the indigenous semiconductor capabilities are very strong, and we’re continuing to see those. And the other thing to remember is that, our solutions set into the fabs is pretty diverse. Everything from nano positioning tools to parametric testers to general purpose. So in services as well, we’re selling a lot of managed services to these organizations as well. So the outlooks continue to look pretty good.
Richard Eastman: Yes.
Ron Nersesian: And we also got some new solutions that are going in for, let’s just say, at a lower price point for a slightly lower performance point that we never had before, which makes us very competitive for others trying to come in and take that business.
Richard Eastman: As the other pieces, the industrial and the auto and energy within the EISG business have grown. Has the gross margin contribution there also expanded such that, when semi test finally does flatten out some, will there be a noticeable impact to the gross margin line for EISG, or have we kind of closed the gap there on profit contribution?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. I’m going to turn this question over to Gooi Soon Chai, who is on the phone with us from Asia and runs EISG.
Gooi Soon Chai: Okay. Thank you, Ron. I think, maybe let me just take a step back and look at EISG overall business segment. We have three major business segment within the EISG, which is the general electronic, which has – the second segment is the automotive energy, and the third segment is around semiconductor. And you’re precisely correct that from a mixed perspective, the best gross margin business that we have essentially comes from the semi business. But again, I think, as what Mark has alluded to, even if we expect some moderation in semiconductor, we do have diversity in the semi portfolio to at least and navigate through for any major perturbation, so to say, because within the semi, we do have offering in the biometric, which is really very much focused on the next-generation process nodes. We also have a good relationship with the – some of the semi equipment manufacturer like currently, we’re working on some of the newer program, by the EUV program, we should expect to continue to grow in 2018 and 2019. And then looking beyond that, we also have other offering in the wafer ecosystem, so that’s one. Now, going back to the other two segments. For the general electronic area, what we see growing especially is IoT application. And we’re focusing a lot on the value-add. So our solution goes not only for the manufacturing ecosystem, but also moving into the design and prototyping, that’s really where we are getting better margin, okay?
Richard Eastman: Okay.
Gooi Soon Chai: And in case of automotive and energy, right? As again, I think Ron mentioned in his – the initial part of the discussion is that, it’s expanding, but we’re also moving into a new field like power electronics and power actually testing with the acquisition of Scienlab. So some work really is now being done to improve gross margin definitely. But we do expect that as we continue growing, we will do beyond just expanding the top line. We’re also focusing on leveraging the skill of Keysight and derive some gross margin improvement over the long run, okay? So hopefully that give a context of what it is in the EISG, okay? Yes.
Richard Eastman: That’s very good. Thanks for the overview. Thank you very much.
Gooi Soon Chai: Okay.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I’d like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary for any closing remarks.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Kiersten. I’d like to turn it over to Ron now for his comments just to wrap us up here.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you very much, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for being on the call. But the best thanks go out to all the employees that have worked very hard to get us in this position, where we have production flowing and that we have generated record orders for the company in over $1 billion record gross margin for the company, as well as 11% core growth. We’re very pleased that the direction and the position of the company right now, and I wish you all a great day.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason. And thank you all for joining us. We will focus today’s discussion on three key topics. First, we delivered strong third quarter results. In total, we achieved 24% order growth, 20% revenue growth, and core order growth accelerated to 8% and we delivered 4% core revenue growth. We generated 19% operating margin and EPS of $0.61, which was $0.03 above the midpoint of our guidance. Second, as we have progressed through the year, we have continued to execute and build momentum in our key growth areas across multiple end-markets. Our success this year demonstrates that our strategy is working and we are pleased with our results. And third, while we have been in business for decades, it is still early days for Keysight and for the technology trends where we are focused. We are just getting started and are excited about our future opportunities. Let’s begin with a review of Keysight’s third quarter performance. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for Keysight. In our markets, we continued to see increased investments in emerging technologies. Our strategy to partner with customers early and to bring full solutions to market that enable customers to accelerate and automate their designs is delivering results, including increased order growth and a strong funnel of opportunities. As a team, we couldn't be more pleased with the momentum we are building in the market with both new and existing customers, developing leading-edge technologies such as 5G, next-generation wireless, high-speed datacenters, and automotive and energy. In total, we delivered 24% order growth or 8% on a core basis. Our investments to bring new solutions to market, our relentless focus on the growth areas like 5G and our go-to-market approach, are fueling our growth. As a result, we are gaining momentum with key players in the industry. Our business is growing as customers increase their investments in R&D, and we believe we are outpacing our competitors. In short, our strategy is working. Keysight is well-aligned with emerging market trends and the needs of our customers. Our continued execution has led to strong year-to-date results and solid progress in our key growth areas. For the nine-month period, we delivered 5% core revenue growth and 9% core order growth, when excluding our aerospace and defense end-market, where we have a solid competitive position but overall market spending has been lower when compared to last year. For the year-to-date period, we have achieved double-digit order growth for our software solutions and high double-digit growth for our 5G solutions. We have maintained our R&D investment level, achieved 19% operating margin, and generated solid cash flow. Even though Keysight has been in business for decades, we are just getting started. We have an incredible bench of talent throughout the organization, a clear defined visions and amazing technology. We are leveraging these strengths to create value for our customers and design our future as a company. Keysight is at the heart of innovation processes and many dynamics end markets. We have a solid foundation to drive continued growth across multiple evolving technology trends, which are in the early days. Today, I will highlight these trends we see in 5G, IoT, automotive and energy, and high-speed datacenters. In 5G, we invested early and have established a leading position and we continue to win business across the communications ecosystem. In the quarter, orders for our 5G solutions more than doubled year-over-year. 5G cellular networks will explore unchartered territory and frequency coverage, data rates, number of simultaneous users, spectral efficiency and reduced latency. Before the standards are even established 5G innovators need to simulate, design and test-in dimensions they’ve never dealt with before. Leveraging our expertise in high frequency and millimeter wave technologies, Keysight has partnered with key industry innovators around the globe and introduced several industry-first solutions, including our new simulation software that provides Verizon and 3GPP standards, 5G link level validation, 5G base stations and handset designs. IoT is also driving growth for Keysight across several of our end markets, including wireless, general consumer electronics and automotive and energy. IoT encompasses a broad range of applications from billions of IoT devices to connected cars, connected grids, and even the connected you. Keysight has a broad portfolio of solutions to help designers fast-track IoT innovation and optimize designs for critical performance attributes, including power consumption, RF performance, interoperability and conformance testing. In our automotive and energy end market, we see growing development activities driven by increasing demands for electric and hybrid cars, as well as the increasing electronic content in vehicles, radar technologies for autonomous driving and high powered devices and applications. Autonomous driving will need multiple sensors, high power computing and artificial intelligence. Additionally, infrastructure will need to support real time information flow. The number of connected cars is estimated to grow to 100 million by 2021, up from just 10 million shipped in 2015. Keysight has achieved double-digit order growth with our automotive and energy solutions for three consecutive quarters. The electronic content in vehicles is rapidly increasing, driving customer investments and manufacturing capacity for the latest generation of capability and R&D investments for next generation features. All of the data traffic created at the edge of the network from the growing number of connected devices and higher speeds requires upgrades across the network, deeper visibility into network operations and greater levels of security; all areas where Ixia has leading technology. While the network test and visibility market dynamics this had been mixed, we are pleased with our competitive position and progress. In network test, our NEM customers have curbed their development investments in speeds up to 100G as they plan and prepare for 400G. While this has decreased demand for 100G and predecessor technologies, we are confident in our 400G technology and believe we are well positioned at spending increases. In the quarter, we achieved strong growth among service provider customers with our visibility and application and security solutions, while we saw continued soft spending with Enterprise accounts in the U.S. While the top line didn't meet our expectations, primarily due to temporary market softness, ISG delivered solid gross margin and operating profit. Additionally, our integration efforts are well on their way, and we are pleased with our progress. Our ability to combine our technologies and to bring complete end-to-end solutions to market enables us to further expand the technology gap between Keysight and the competition. We have already begun partnering on end-to-end development of next-generation technologies and currently have six joint projects under development. We recently introduced our first joint end-to-end solution, well ahead of our planned timeline. Our new Cellular and Wi-Fi emulation system is the industry's first test platform to cover a complete cellular and Wi-Fi system, enabling simultaneous signaling tests over the protocol stack from physical transmission to data traffic transmission. With this new solution, customers can view the performance of the complete protocol stack with end-to-end performance verification needed for emerging and demanding applications such as IoT, connected car and 5G. In summary, we are very pleased with the third quarter performance and continued progress in building multiple avenues of growth across a diverse set of end markets. We are executing on our strategy to create value for our customers and shareholders by building on our heritage, partnering with customers early to create new opportunities, and driving growth across multiple avenues of emerging technology trends. Additionally, we have expanded the value that Keysight brings to the market. To deliver the next world-changing innovation, our customers need help with more than just test and measurement of physical devices. With more complicated and integrated functionality, electronic devices are vulnerable to faults at any point in the technology stack. We need to verify the quality, performance, compliance and security of products at every layer from Layer 1 to Layer 7, as well as how they integrate into live networks. Through our acquisition of Ixia, Keysight helps customers gain insight into how products are functioning at every layer. We believe we are poised to continue to drive growth as customers increase R&D investments and deploy next-generation technologies. We look forward to sharing our progress with you along the way. With that, I will turn the call over to Neil for a detailed review of our financial performance and fourth quarter outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today, we reported third quarter GAAP revenue of $832 million and non-GAAP revenue of $863 million, which excludes the impact of the acquisition related fair value adjustments to Ixia’s deferred revenue balance. Core revenue, which excludes the impact of currency and revenue from acquisitions completed within the last twelve months, grew 4% year-over-year and was ahead of our guidance of 2% core growth. Growth was driven across all geographies. Regionally, core revenue grew 1% in the Americas, 8% in Europe, 2% in Japan and 6% in Asia, excluding Japan. Looking at our operational results, gross margin was 60.9%, a year-over-year increase of 220 basis points, driven by the addition of Ixia. Operating expenses totaled $362 million compared with $281 million in the same period last year, reflecting a full quarter of Ixia expenses and increased sales investment. This resulted in third quarter operating margin of 19%, which was down 50 basis points when compared with 19.5% last year. We reported a GAAP net loss of $18 million or a loss of $0.10 per share, which includes a $134 million unfavorable impact from the amortization of acquisition-related assets related to Ixia. On a non-GAAP basis, we delivered net income of $115 million, up 7% over last year and $0.61 in earnings per share. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 188 million shares. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, includes two primary end-markets. First is the commercial communications end-market, the reported revenue of $254 million compared to $252 million in the prior year third quarter. Growth in wireless was partially offset by softer spending in infrastructure. CSG also includes our aerospace, defense and government end markets, which generated revenue of $164 million in Q3 compared with $172 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting softer spending in the U.S. due to the budget approval delays we saw earlier this year. While [ABG] orders have stabilized and we expect spending in the U.S. to strengthen in Q4, it is difficult to predict exactly when the flow of funding will return to a steady state in this end-market. Over the long-term, we remained bullish on both our market position in aerospace and defense and the prospect for increased defense spending in the U.S. Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $418 million compared with $424 million in the same quarter last year. CSG reported gross margin of 61.2% and operating margin of 15.7%. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated third quarter revenue of $218 million, up 14% from the same quarter last year. General electronics, semiconductor measurement solutions and automotive and energy solutions all posted double-digit growth. As we noted last quarter, we’ve had several quarters of robust growth in semiconductor measurement solutions and we expect this to moderate somewhat as we move into our fiscal fourth quarter and first quarter of next fiscal year. EISG reported gross margin of 61.1% and operating margin of 25.3%. Our Ixia Solutions Group, generated revenue of $120 million, gross margin of 77%, and an operating margin of 19.9%. As Ron mentioned, we are well on our way with our integration efforts and are on track with our cost synergy timeline. We expect to achieve annualized run-rate cost synergies of $40 million by Q3 of next fiscal year and remain committed to delivering the full $60 million of cost synergies over time. Moving to the Services Solutions Group. SSG generated third quarter revenue of $107 million, a 4% year-over-year increase. SSG reported gross margin of 41.8% and operating margin of 18.1%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with $873 million in cash and cash equivalents. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $98 million. Capital purchases were $21 million in the quarter, resulting in free cash flow of $77 million. In addition, we paid down $240 million of debt related to the Ixia acquisition this quarter. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the fourth quarter. Our current outlook for the fourth quarter reflects our very healthy 8% core order growth rate in Q3 and strong backlog as we enter into the fourth quarter. As Ron mentioned, partnering with customers early and delivering full solutions is a cornerstone of our go-to-market strategy. As a result, we are seeing a higher mix of solution sales within our business, which have a longer order-to-revenue conversion cycle when compared with our historic product-centric approach to the market, and we have accounted for this in our Q4 outlook. We currently expect Q4 non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $875 million to $905 million, representing 3% core growth at the midpoint. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.59 to $0.69 or $0.64 at the midpoint, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 189 million shares. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Ron, income would love if you could perhaps share some update on how the integration is going with Ixia so far. How you are bringing the two sales organizations together? And if you could just touch on the revenue performance in the quarter, may be between network testing and visibility growth, specifically available?
Ron Nersesian: First, I’ll answer the first part of your question, and then I’ll let Bethany give a couple of highlights on the breakdown between MTS and NVS. Overall, the integration is going excellent. As you know, we have an integration team; we developed a lot of expertise when we were with Agilent; and also, with our acquisitions that we’ve done here in the services group, as well as what we’ve done with Anite. So things are completely on track. We said we would get the integration done within a year and we are still on track to meet or exceed that timeline. So that’s working extremely well. There have not been any major surprises. As far as the sales force, the two teams are collaborating right now. For instance, we have a solution which is this new Wi-Fi cellular solution that utilizes expertise and product development that was done in the Ixia Group, as well as done in the Communication Solutions Group. So given that, we have sales force collaboration that’s going on, and leads being passed from one sales force to the other. And they are working on going ahead and optimizing our results, going forward. Of course, we look for ways to leverage that even further in the future. And I can’t share anything else with you right now, but I am very optimistic on our prospects. I’ll turn it over to Bethany now to talk a little bit about NTS and NVS.
Bethany Mayer: Just briefly, we did see some softness on the MTS side of the business, and that was primarily in the 100 Gig and below space some softness in spending there. And that has mostly to do with the network equipment manufacturers beginning focus on 400 Gig. We've been doing very well with 400 Gig this year and we anticipate that continuing into next year as we have first to market product there and very, very strong future functionality set. So even though we saw a pause in spending on the 100 Gig side of the business, the 400 Gig in Layer 2, 3 was good. Our apps and security business also did well. But overall, the test business was down this quarter as a result of 100 Gig. On the visibility side of the business, we actually saw double-digit growth there. And although, enterprise was somewhat soft, we saw very good growth in the service provider side of our business there. So mixed this quarter and just hope that gives you a little sense of what's going on right now on the revenue side.
Ron Nersesian: And on the profitability side, Ixia delivered its numbers and was able to deliver excellent gross margin and excellent profitability on the bottom line.
Brandon Couillard: And then one more on the aerospace and defense business. You just characterized how your visibility has improved there, perhaps over the last several months, whether aerospace and defense orders were actually up in the third quarter and whether you think this business can return to more positive growth in 4Q?
Ron Nersesian: First of all, we view the aerospace defense as a real growth opportunity for us that it's added relatively low level compared to historic levels because of the budget issues. But we see the environment in the world becoming most hostile, and the need for more high technology spending in aerospace defense to continue to increase. So that presents opportunities for us here, as well as abroad with our friendly, let's just say, partners. And we're very bullish on the long-term prospect. This quarter, we saw 2% growth in orders for aerospace and defense. And again, we saw orders that were roughly flat last quarter. So where we know that we've bottomed out and we’re also in a very good position on a lot of growth in RFPs. So we're very optimistic as that turns up, things will improve and give us some growth off of the base line that we’re at. On top of that September 30th is the U.S. ended year cycle, budget cycle and we always see some increased performance at the end of September. So we're encouraged by that. We also have a lot of business that comes from prime. So as they get involved in programs, even though it's not direct governments spending, we also will see some improvement there.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Can I just circle back for a minute around to Ixia? If I do the math right, perhaps the orders in the fiscal Q3 were around $115 million. And the question goes to maybe the fourth quarter that I think as your at you mid-point of revenue guide for the fourth quarter, it suggest maybe Ixia’s revenue would be down maybe $105 million for the quarter, at the midpoint. And I guess, what I’m curious at is, I mean, there is commentary, Bethany made commentary around 400G and some of the growth areas. But is that the backlog that’s maybe stretched out into the first half of ’18? Is that maybe where the delta is coming from between the orders and maybe the outlook at midpoint?
Ron Nersesian: So Rick, first of all, we didn’t make any comments around Ixia orders. So I don’t know what’s math you were doing to get to those numbers.
Richard Eastman: Well, if core orders were up 8%, and I presume the delta in the order number would be Ixia. That’s how I got there.
Ron Nersesian: Plus currently, yes. But the revenue math, I disagree with your revenue math. I think you’re underestimating what we have baked into our plans for Ixia as far as revenue in the fourth quarter. So we are -- obviously, as Bethany said, there is some market softness there. We do believe the market, this is temporary. We expect the market to return to growth sometime late in the calendar year, so likely our Q1. But we believe this is a relatively small pause in the market, relatively short pause in the market. So check your math, you’re pretty significantly understated that versus what I believe the math should say.
Richard Eastman: And then the just last question, around the Services Solutions Group. Is the softness on the defense side, aerospace and defense side, you said also impacting the calibration side of that business, on the service side?
Ron Nersesian: I’ll turn it over to John Page, the Head of Services and Solutions.
John Page: Yes, there is actually some small impact from the aerospace defense on the calibration side of the business.
Richard Eastman: And is it a reasonable expectation to assume some step up there in the growth rate as we move forward on the SSG business in the fourth quarter and into next year?
John Page: Yes, absolutely. So the services tends to be a longer cycle than the product side so you see a delayed effect. But yes, the spending in the aerospace defense market picks up, we’d expect to see the calibration business and that pick up as well.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: I wanted to circle back on the 8% core order growth number in the quarter. Ron, I think in response to a prior question, you noted that A&D orders were up 2%. I was hoping you guys could provide some color for the other segments, please.
Ron Nersesian: So, we don’t provide it. On the call, the only other number we put out there was, in fact that I think the only other one. The other comment, I think it was a real strength for the quarter commercial communication, because we have seen some weakness in that area over a number of quarters, particularly as we’ve been in this trough between 4G and 5G. Our commercial communications business orders were up 10% this year or this quarter; so a very strong performance there than that. Those are primary breakdowns that we provide.
Neil Dougherty: Toshiya, I’ll give you just a little bit more insight. As was mentioned earlier, the Electronic Industrial Group had order growth or core order growth that was in the double-digits. And that includes all of the sub-segments in the Group. In particular, if you look at the growth initiatives what we had outlined approximately three years ago on where we would focus and where we could get growth; the software business that we had, had double-digit; our modular business has double-digit growth. And we don’t think that make sense to report that, going forward. But I’ll just mention it casually at this point what makes more sense of the end market applications; auto and energy also a double-digit growth; and the last, which is 5G, had triple-digit order growth. So those are the growth initiatives that are driving our business. We focused around the market trends that really provide growth opportunity and we’re very, very happy with the progress. The matter of fact, if you were to just step back and take a longer term look to the 2018 outlook, we are now two years into the three to four year growth transformation that we outlined in our Investor Day in September of 2015. At that time, we also outlined a long-term expectation of 8% to 10% earnings growth. With our continued operational excellence, the growth initiatives that I’ve mentioned and the addition of Ixia, we expect to be at the high end of this range in fiscal 2018.
Toshiya Hari: And then my second question was on commercial communications. And Neil, you may have partially answered this question in your response. But in your prepared remarks, you guys talked about growth in 5G and new wireless technologies being offset by weaker spending in 4G. And I think this is something that you guys have talked about for a number of quarters. But at what point do you think the strength in 5G and say the new Wi-Fi technologies trump the lower spending in 4G? Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: That’s great question. I am going to get a chance to introduce Satish who is the new President of our Communications Solutions Group. He previously was running the Wireless Device Operations Group, which had done an exceptional job of turning around that business, and getting it to growth. And I’ll let him make some comments on commercial communications.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Just to make some opening remarks, we see a momentum for our 5G business for the past year building. And I’d say that this quarter, with the tripling of orders that we saw, we feel like we’re starting to outpace the declines from legacy communications that you would typically expect in a cycle. If I fast forward, if I go back in time I should say a year ago, most of our customers in the 5G space were from research and technology OEM efforts. Where we are as an industry is pretty exciting, because now the industry is accelerating towards the 3GPP and our specification, the first version is due in December. I think we’ll make it. And then with that comes the tremendous challenge of implementing these things across the entire ecosystem; components, chipsets, devices, base stations, so on and so forth. So we’ve established, consistent with the strategy that Ron has played out, leading edge collaborations with market making customers. Customers are the front end of this technology and we’re in the game with them co-innovating in multiple domains. I would say you’d look at the challenges of 5G, it’s not just 4G times four, it’s in deforming channel modeling, bringing up the software layers. And we have a one-stop shop approach for our customers and walking them through this journey, which we’re in the pre-standard phase and the post-standard phase. So it's really a powerful story. It was still in early days, because the standards are not done yet. But we feel very good about the solutions we are creating. The other point I'll make is about how we’re doing it. We're doing this through a platform approach using our modular innovation sets that will be kicked-off a few years ago. And that's a big differentiator provide us more competitive edge as we look ahead. And lastly, I'll say the fact that we’re with the market makers and we're co-innovating with them, gives us a good run runway for our 5G business looking ahead.
Ron Nersesian: It's great to see all of that add up to 10% core growth for our commercial communications business.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: I mean since you’re the measurement Company that I thought it's helpful to hear from you. One level of resolution, if you could, on the order strength you’re seeing in 5G, and in connected car software. Are there any specific use cases, OEMs, geographies, anything and everything if you could, nested down one level below it will be helpful for us to internalize that order strength? Thanks.
Ron Nersesian: We’ll have Satish give a couple of more comments.
Satish Dhanasekaran: I would just that the strength is pretty broad and it starts with the chipset and components in a way the innovators in the 5G space. As I mentioned, beam forming, channel modeling, earlier tests and including bring up of the entire software stack for 5G, all of this is occurring in parallel. And for us, if we look internally, it's our ability to provide the correlation between base band to IF to millimeter wave, in a singular platform that gives us the competitive edge and we're working with all the market makers. But the strength is broad. We have seen innovators come online across the globe. And so that's why I say that the runway is pretty strong.
Ron Nersesian: I'd like now to turn it over to Soon Chai Gooi, who basically runs the Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, as well as heading up all of our order fulfillment organization. And he is doing an exceptional job and has delivered double-digit order growth and double-digit revenue growth for EISG, as well as delivering double-digit order growth for our automotive business. And I'm sure he can make a couple of comments on automotive.
Gooi Soon Chai: So I think as what Neil has mentioned. We continue to make good strides in the automotive energy segment, delivering double-digit growth for the last three quarters. In fact, what is exciting is that the automotive industry is actually going through a major transformation, and moving from a mechanical base to electronic base industry. And what we are doing now is that we are leveraging our Keysight call measurement capabilities enable innovation in this space. So we’ve expanded a whole suite of differential solution. So it ranges from design validation and testing of automotive electronic control units. We are involved in the connected car through our ADAS, which is Advanced Driver Assistant System Solution, all the way through our battery testing or EV and hybrid electronic vehicle, so definitely lot of opportunities. And what is also leveraging from our strength is our customer base. Our customer base, essentially spend from the whole automotive supply chain. So again just from the top-tier automotive makers to modules produces to, I think, what Satish mentioned, in chipset suppliers. So overall, I know the secrete momentum, especially in the automotive and energy segment.
Vijay Bhagavath: A quick follow-on Neil. Any modeling guidelines you could give us on product mix, gross margins, OpEx heading into the back half?
Neil Dougherty: I think our business model remains intact. So obviously, the addition of Ixia is net favorable to gross margins, it’s a couple of points, is approximately takes us into the low 60s from a gross margin perspective. We’ll be looking to obviously maintain our R&D investment. We do typically see, as we move from Q3 to Q4 both in R&D and SG&A, a sequential uptick. And that primarily just relates to the end of summer season. We’ve got a lot of employees that are out on SEO during the third quarter. So we get the vacation benefit as well as just general decreased spending impact from that. So you do tend to see an uptick as you move from Q3 to Q4 on the spending line. Ixia is going to be net additive to gross margin, a couple of points. So I think over the longer term, some of the other trends that we see with the migration towards software, migration towards solutions selling, migration towards R&D solutions, we’ll continue to offer gross margin upside, but that’s over the longer term.
Operator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Krish Sankar: Ron, I have a question. First, since you guys cater to like multiple verticals, like communications, aerospace, defense, auto, et cetera. Can you just tell us a little bit about how to think about seasonality in each of these segments, and also the cyclicality? In other words, where are we in the cycle for these different end-markets? And also had a follow-up after that.
Ron Nersesian: So I’ll just make some generalized comments. And then obviously, there’s some industry research reports on certain areas. The bigger -- there is a couple of things. One of the typical cyclicalities and the second thing is what a really -- some inherent new growth that is coming in each area. So in automotive, we really did not play very much in that market in the past as it was in electro mechanical device. And we’re basically looking for low-tech electronics, which is not necessarily where we focus and where we add the most value. And now as it moves to basically be high speed computer with, high speed wireless signal sources and signal receivers, we’re going to pick-up on the inflection on that. We’re just in the beginning in that cycle. The second thing is aerospace defense. The aerospace defense business has been depressed since the election due to the budgeting cycle. But there is no doubt that everyone is talking about more and they have to work through that. So I don’t think it’s so much cyclical issue there. The only cyclicality that we typically see is a push at the end of the year with the September 30th end of the year cycle. Semiconductors, has plenty of reports to look at the SIA Index. We do have a portion of our business, a small portion of our business that plays into semiconductor R&D manufacturing. We will be affected by that a little bit. But again, it’s less than 10% of our overall business. So those are the major sectors that I would talk about. With the exception of 5G -- 5G, we are in the low between 4G and 5G, right now. And we’ve seen that in certain areas. You see that on the protocol side, the protocol development side. But on the other hand, 5G is accelerating and the timelines are being pulled in and that’s why we keep seeing this doubling of our business. And we’re very, very thankful that when we split from Agilent, we decided to focus and focus early and we’re in a better position in 5G than we were in 4G by a good margin.
Krish Sankar: And then as a follow-up, on the 5G opportunity, I understand we are still in the pre-standard phase. But is there any cannibalization potential where some of your existing customers could reuse some of the 4G testers? Or would you consider all of 5G to your greenfield opportunity for both you guys and the test and management industry, in general?
John Page: There’s no doubt that what happens is some of the equipment can be reused, but they’re going through completely different frequencies that are much higher performance for much of 5G, and that is stuff that cannot be deployed. When you’re talking about sub 6 gigahertz and now you’re talking about going to over 50 gigahertz, those products will not work. There is some reuse, but it’s much smaller than we’ve seen in past -- than in past cycles.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Newton: I guess, first one is on the Ixia front. You talked about the current softness being temporary. But I wanted to take more of a longer term view on the business. So I think in the recent filing, you targeted a three to five year long-term growth rate of 14% to 17% for this business. So I am curious, if you can help us understand how that CAGR split between the MPS and the visibility side of the business? And is this still the right long-term growth rate, given the current soft patch and hand off the 400 gig?
Ron Nersesian: So let me make a couple of comments there. I think what you’re referring to is when we completed the acquisition of Ixia, we divided the business into two separate markets; a test market, which we think is growing low to mid single-digits; and a visibility market, which we think is growing much faster than that. So obviously, from an Ixia perspective -- and if you take the combined market growth rate of those, you get to somewhere around that 15% range. But for Ixia’s business, as a whole, it’s heavily weighted towards the test side. There relatively small portion of the revenue exists in the visibility space. So I think as we look forward, obviously, we have seen a temporary slowdown in growth rates. We do believe the market returns to growth early next fiscal year for us, and we continue to be on pace with regard to the synergy capture; so very much optimistic about the future.
Patrick Newton: And then I guess on the CSG side, the op margin was down about 240 bps year-over-year. I am sorry if I missed this. I didn’t hear maybe a reason behind that. And within the CSG, could you comment a little bit on the optical business, given that there has been some well known softness in the Chinese markets?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, so let me take the first part of that, and I’ll let Satish comment on the optical piece. With regard to the profitability in CSG, I just pointed two things that we had a tough compare from a profit perspective for Q3, because in the year ago quarter, we had $6 million of one-time favorable adjustment to our warranty reserve. And obviously, we’d see achieving the largest ever businesses. They’ve got the majority of that benefit. You also have seen some increased investment in sales in our sales force as we look to capture growth. So I think those are the two primary things. Revenue is down as well, but the primary drivers of the tough compare with a one-time a favorable year ago and increased investment in the field to capture growth.
Satish Dhanasekaran: So maybe elevating the conversation to 100G and 400G, for the past four quarters prior, we’ve being seeing good growth for our 100G solutions in manufacturing. And what we are now projecting is that that growth is tapering off. We're engaged with leading transceiver companies on the 400G bring up, and that's still in early R&D phases. And we expect that market to kick into gear given all the dynamics of optical and other things that you described. But it will probably be a few quarters out.
Neil Dougherty: But it is worthwhile to know Patrick that the wireless device part of commercial communications outpaced the internet infrastructure where you see a lot of the fiber businesses. Both of these sub segments grew, but the wireless device operation pulled the weighted average up to 10%.
Patrick Newton: Great. And if I can sneak one more in your EISG Group, it was performing incredibly well. Can you help us understand the relative of mix revenue from auto, energy, the semiconductor parametric test, general electronics, or any other bucket I might be missing?
Ron Nersesian: Yes. So I wish we haven’t sized those specific buckets recently. Obviously, the general electronics piece is the largest portion of those relatively speaking semi is second and auto is third. But auto is currently the fastest growing of the three.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Farhan Ahmad: My first question is on -- you talked about this long before 400 gigs. And I wanted to understand if how long is this linear view, and how should we think about the ramp-up in the 400 gig?
Ron Nersesian: I'll turn that over to Bethany.
Bethany Mayer: So 100G and those speeds that are below that, the 40 gig, 10, 1 gig, those are what have slowed down a bit at the current juncture. But what we're seeing is, I think those will continue to move along. I mean there’s nothing -- will be huge dramatic changes, but continue to move along to certain extent. What we’re really seeing though is that many of the folks that we do business with on a regular basis; so now with equipment manufacturers, many of the providers, cloud providers as well, are very interested in working on the 400 gig opportunities for products rollout, as well as potentially even network rollout. So that opportunity is beginning to take hold for us this year. We launched the product earlier this year in 400-gig. Actually, we’ve had a product now longer than that. But we would launch it earlier this year for our customer base and the datacenter space. And that has done well for us and that will continue to do well for us, going forward, into next year. So we think this wave will continue in through the end of the calendar year, as well as certainly into next year. And we’re excited about the opportunity, because first, we’re first to market but also the functionality in the optical transceiver solution that we provide, we think is superior. So overall, it is a good opportunity for us as a company at Keysight; going into next year, as Satish mentioned, it's also an opportunity for his organization; and overall, with Keysight, high speed datacenter and cloud provider data centers are absolutely a strong trend that will continue into next year.
Farhan Ahmad: Then it was really good to see your commercial communication growing 10% year-on-year for orders. I just wanted to understand. If you we should think that this is sustainable level for next few quarters, and as the business turned around, their 5G orders are now picked up to a point that they’re driving the growth already? Or is it just that you have more of the systems solution that you talked about in those longer lead products that are driving the business right now and we will see the growth rate decelerating here?
Ron Nersesian: So I think the most relevant point that Satish made is that this is really the first quarter where we start to see the growth in 5G outpace the declines that are coming from the legacy technologies, including 4G. So, I don’t like to draw long-term conclusions over a single data point. But I think that is significant. I think we believe we’re very well positioned in 5G. We’ve engaged early with customers. We are talking with -- we are working very closely with the companies that we believe are going to be market markers in 5G. And we’re going to capture more than our fair share of the market at the 5G as the 5G story develops.
Neil Dougherty: We have 34 different collaborations with market makers and standards bodies to make sure that we stay in front of this opportunity, and we’re very pleased with what we’ve gotten so far.
John Page: I just want to add to that by saying the innovations in 4G are not done. And what we’re seeing is some early signs that some of the 4.5G features, 1 gigabit per second Narrowband IoT are you starting to kick in, providing some stability to some of the drag that we had experienced for the past few quarters. So feel good about the outlook.
Bethany Mayer: My comment would also be on the Ixia side, our advanced LTE is doing very, very well, very strong and good growing this year. So that’s basically what ushers in 5G.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Wolf from Barclays. Your line is open.
Joseph Wolf: I guess one more on the 5G opportunity. Would you be so bold or kind to talk about what you think your market share would be? Or maybe from a different angle, what is the competitive landscape looking like if we’re still early on in that development cycle and you’re seeing triple-digit order growth that must be an attractive opportunity. So how do you stay ahead and how sticky are these early wins, or how broad are they across that CASM or that move from the testing into the deployment in the field?
John Page: As you noted, we’re still early days in terms of the 5G rollout. I think most notably, as Ron mentioned, we made the decision very early and the formation of Keysight to shift some of R&D investments to make sure we got a first mover advantage in 5G, and we’re seeing that play out now. So we can’t give you specific market share numbers. But sufficed to say, we believe we’re running in the market. That being said, there’s a number of very strong competitors in this space, and they’re not going to sit by and seed to us. So we need to continue to innovate and work closely with our customers, meet their timelines to protect and maintain the first mover advantage that we believe we have at this point in time.
Ron Nersesian: The technology also was not new to us. The fundamental technologies of much higher frequency, is something that we’ve been doing for aerospace, defense for a long period of time. And it is new to many of our competitors. And also, we invested early and we invested more overall. That’s the strategy of what we thought we needed to do laid out three years ago, and now the shareholders are starting to get rewarded.
Joseph Wolf: And then you talked about collaboration, I think it was five or six new projects with Ixia. I was just hoping for a little bit more color there, whether this was customer driven, is it company led? And how should we think about the time from you guys telling us about a project to a product that is producing some revenue or at least an order pattern?
Ron Nersesian: I’ll let Bethany go ahead and describe the six projects, or at least give you a little bit of color on that. And then we will see these projects make its way into our guidance as we guide each quarter.
Bethany Mayer: So we just had a recent announcement about one of the product offerings, which is a Wi-Fi and cellular emulation. So essentially the idea is that we can test for our customers all the way from Layer 1 in the stack, all of the protocols from that point all the way to Layer 7, using our solutions; so whether it’s cellular or whether it’s Wi-Fi, we are capable of testing a full protocol stack across all layers and all spectrums. I mean that’s pretty compelling. And I would say that that is certainly one that was driven in part by customer interest. And so customers took note of the acquisition of Ixia by Keysight and put two and two together themselves as we did almost simultaneously, and we received inbounds from them on this. We’re also doing work on wireless UE, as well and that’s work in conjunction again with the organization in CSG, and that’s beginning in the cycle. Again, that is a customer driven in a certain sense, but also company driven as well, because we can see the real value opportunity between our wireless test load products and some of the capabilities that, on the radio side, that we see in CSG. So we find first that that’s a compelling opportunity, we think, for our customers and we’ve also gotten feedback that that would be of great interest to them as well. Then we have another product activity that I am not going to go into any detail on. But just, I would just say that each of these things are in our wheelhouse, whether it’s security, whether it’s IoT, or whether it’s in the communication spaces, the two I just mentioned. And then the other activities, the other three activities; are really around work in the sales force; ensuring that we can gain the scale of the Keysight sales force across the Ixia product portfolio; working with John Page’s team in the services aspects of our business. Because as you know, Ixia has a services aspect to what we sell and Keysight, obviously, has wonderful scale there to take advantage of; and so the last three are in these sales and services area of focus for the company overall. So I think it's been a very exciting journey, even for the short time that we've been together, to create what we think are compelling value prepositions for customers, as well as to create more scale to bring to market the products that Ixia offers and combine them with Keysight. So that's all I have. Ron?
Ron Nersesian: Thank you very much, Bethany. We have two minutes left and we have one more question. So let's move on to Stanley.
Operator: Stanley Kovler from Citi Research. Your line is open.
Stanley Kovler: I'll make this real quick. I just wanted to see if you can comment on some of the investments that you’re making in the CSG sales force. Should be expect that to continue? And then if I may on the 4G business trends. Can you just help us better understand the delta between your 4G business trends, you’re talking about order growth and potential 4.5G opportunities whereas some of the players who are deploying the networks are taking some headwinds. Just wanted to understand the bifurcated trends there? Thank you.
Mark Wallace: I'll make a comment on the investments we’re making in the sales force, not just for CSG but for the overall Company. As was mentioned by Ron and Satish, one of our go-to-market strategies is to engage early with the industry leaders. We're building up capabilities around that ecosystem, around the different ecosystems, with both sales and support and other types of engineering resources that are innovating with these industry leaders. And then the other part is an expansion of our sales force worldwide to extend our reach to many emerging customers, new accounts and leverage the success we're achieving with the industry leaders. So that's an ongoing campaign where we’re increasing our footprint and our sales capabilities around the world and across all these industry segments aligned with the growth initiatives that Keysight has identified. So this is helping to fuel the order growth that we've been spending most of the day today talking about. So that’s the first part. Now, I'll hand it over to Satish to talk about the second.
Satish Dhanasekaran: Yes, I'll make a couple of quick comments. I think if we look into the 4.5G features, they are all be in spec sort of waiting for adoption. We're starting to see some of it from Verizon announcing the 1 gigabit per second, and you probably saw that at MWC as well. So there have been some innovation trends underway in the 4.5G space. But what we found is, for the past year, the industry was pretty consumed with the shifting emphasis on 5G. So when you combine the fact that early in the cycle now, people are starting to look at this 4.5G features and we also see some operator interest we feel good about where we play. Obviously, the network rollouts for these 4.5G features might be a little bit delayed in the cycle.
Ron Nersesian: Well, this is, Ron. In summary, thank you very much for joining us for the call. Again, I'm very pleased with our growth progress so far. As you know, we have a very diverse business and sub-segments or little pieces can be up or down for a while. But we have multiple ways to win, and that’s why we’re excited to deliver 10% EPS growth in FY ’18 for our investors. Thank you very much. Have a great day.

Ron Nersesian : Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. As I am traveling internationally today, I will keep my formal comments brief and focus the discussion on three topics.  First, we achieved a strong second quarter that was substantially ahead of our expectations and we are pleased with our execution and results. In total, we delivered 6% order growth, 3% revenue growth, 19% operating margin, and 5% earnings growth.  Second, we continued to build momentum with our key growth areas. We achieved record orders for 5G including a significant win with Qualcomm as we announced in a press release this morning. We also had record orders for our modular and automotive and energy solutions. We believe our continued progress demonstrates that our strategy is working and our transformation is well underway.  And third, we closed the acquisition of Ixia in April, which was ahead of our expected timeline as we efficiently obtained financing and cleared all necessary regulatory approvals. We are thrilled to officially have the Ixia team on-board and now focus our joint-efforts on the integration, innovation, and increased value creation.  Let's begin with a review of Keysight's second quarter performance. In addition to our strong total results that I just referenced, Keysight excluding Ixia, delivered 4% organic order growth, 2% core revenue growth, 20% operating margin, and $0.64 in EPS.  Taking a deeper look into our bottom-line performance, excluding Ixia and the associated interest expense and share dilution from the acquisition financing, we delivered $0.67 in earnings per share, a 10% improvement over Q2 of last year. The dynamics in our end-markets remained relatively consistent with last quarter as customers continued to focus their investment on next generation technologies.  In our aerospace, defense, and government end-market, funding in the U.S. partially recovered off its soft Q1 to bring orders in line with last year. In the growth segments of our markets, we continued to build solid momentum and finished the second quarter stronger than we had expected. Our growth was driven by continued investment in next generation technologies including 5G, IoT, high-speed datacenters, the electric car, autonomous driving, and next-generation process technologies.  Our focus on bringing solutions to markets that help customers accelerate their next-generation designs across the communications ecosystem is allowing us to drive multiple avenues of growth across these trends. To demonstrate our progress in capitalizing on these evolving trends, I will share with you a few highlights in the quarter that we find particularly exciting:  First, orders for our 5G solutions doubled over Q2 of last year to reach a new record and we secured a significant 5G win with Qualcomm for our industry-first 5G protocol design solution that we just launched this quarter. This solution enables developers the ability to seamlessly prototype designs as they migrate from pre-5G to 5G New Radio and address protocol layer design, an area of the market where we did not participate in 4G. With our targeted efforts in 5G and our leadership in high-frequency technologies and solutions, we believe we have established a leading position in the 5G marketplace, and are on a solid path towards our goal of being first in 5G.  Second, in high-speed datacenters, we saw an increase in development activities for 400 Gig, PAM-4 and silicon photonics technologies, which drove demand for our recently introduced 64 Giga baud bit error rate tester developed for electrical and optical PAM-4 transmitters and receivers.  Ixia has also taken a leadership role in 400 Gig innovation. Earlier this year at OFC, Ixia demonstrated line rate 400 Gig Ethernet with PAM-4 electrical lanes. Ixia is the first and only player in the market with this solution in the latest double density form factor. This first-to-market solution underlines why Ixia is the leader in the network test market, and delivers continued proof of their technology leadership over the competition.  Third, in the automotive and energy market, we delivered a record quarter with strong revenue growth across all regions as the automotive ecosystem continued to grow at a healthy rate and Tier-1 suppliers expanded their design capacity. The rapid electrification of vehicles and the move to autonomous-driving is shifting this industry from mechanics to our areas of strength in wireless communications, radar, and smart battery development. We are gaining strong momentum with leading customers in this evolving industry and growing ecosystem.  Notably, in the second quarter, we added 10 key new customers. Our expanding customer base in this end-market includes top-tier automotive makers, as well as specialized automotive electronic module producers, chipset vendors, and energy component and battery producers.  And lastly, we achieved another quarter of strong growth in next generation processing technologies, where we have a leading position in parametric test. In the back-half of the quarter, new investments in the build-out of capacity in China drove higher than expected demand, which contributed to the upside in our second quarter results. Our leadership in this end-market coupled with our record performance in automotive and energy resulted in 14% year-over-year revenue growth for our EISG segment.  In summary, we are very pleased with our second-quarter performance and continued steady progress in building multiple avenues of growth across a diverse set of end markets where customers are investing in next-generation digital and electronic technologies. We are confident that we have the right strategy in place, it is working and our transformation is well underway.  Our strong innovation and solutions portfolio uniquely positions us for growth as these long-term trends continue to evolve and customers invest in next-generation technologies. It is undeniable that the digital landscape is transforming and will continue to influence the way we communicate, drive, shop, and even obtain medical care in the years to come. Whether it is for high-speed datacenters, next generation mobile networks, radar, electronic warfare, automobiles, or medical devices, Keysight’s solutions go where the electronic signal goes from design simulation, to prototype validation, to production test, to optimization in the network.  Now, with the acquisition of Ixia, which we closed in April, we have broadened our reach within and beyond these growth trends and the communications development lifecycle. Keysight's reach now includes digital packetized data, applications, visibility and network security, as well as electrical signals. We are excited to add Ixia’s deep bench of talent to Keysight’s team, which will continue to be led by Bethany Mayer.  Our integration efforts are off to a great start and we look forward to partnering on end-to-end development of next-generation technologies. Together, we will expand our number of touch points with long-term technology trends and key customers, and accelerate our growth.  With that, I will turn the call over to Neil for a detailed review of our financial performance and the third-quarter outlook.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today, we reported second quarter GAAP revenue of $753 million, which includes 13 days of revenue from Ixia, and non-GAAP revenue of $758 million, which excludes the impact of the acquisition-related fair value adjustment to Ixia’s deferred revenue balance.  Core revenue, which excludes the impact of currency and revenue from acquisitions completed within the last 12 months grew 2% year over year and was ahead of our updated guidance range. Regionally, core revenue declined 1% in the Americas, 3% in Europe, and 5% in Japan, while in Asia excluding Japan core revenue grew 10%.  Looking at our operational results, gross margin was 59.0%, a year-over-year increase of 120 basis points driven by favorable product mix with a higher contribution of software and EISG solutions. Operating expenses totaled $300 million, a $10 million increase over the same period last year reflecting Ixia expenses for the partial-period. Excluding Ixia, year-over-year operating expenses were flat, demonstrating our ongoing operating model discipline. This resulted in second quarter operating margin of 19.4%, up 110 basis points when compared with 18.3% last year.  We reported net income of $114 million or $0.64 per share. Excluding Ixia and the associated interest expense and share dilution from the acquisition financing, which was not in our guidance, we delivered net income of $116 million or $0.67 per share, which represents approximately 10% earnings growth versus the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. We ended the quarter with a weighted average diluted share count of 179 million shares.  Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, includes two primary end-markets. First is the commercial communications end market that reported revenue of $256 million, compared to $257 million in the prior year second quarter. Growth from 5G and next-generation datacenter technologies was offset by soft spending in wireless 4G.  CSG also includes our aerospace, defense and government end markets, which generated revenue of $168 million in Q2, compared with $189 million in the same quarter last year. As we mentioned on our last quarterly call, our aerospace, defense and government end- market was impacted in Q1 by soft spending in the U.S. due to delayed budget approvals. A federal budget with increased funding for defense was approved by Congress in late April and we did see a partial recovery in Q2 order results, however, it is difficult to predict exactly when the flow of funding will return to a steady state in this end market. Over the long term we remain bullish on both our market position in aerospace and defense and the prospect for increased defense spending in the U.S.  Total CSG revenue for the quarter was $424 million, compared with $446 million in the same quarter last year. CSG reported gross margin of 61.3% and operating margin of 17.6%. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated second quarter revenue of $220 million, up 14% from the same quarter last year and a record high.  Semiconductor measurement solutions and automotive and energy solutions both posted strong growth, which was partially offset by a decline in the broader general electronics market. As we noted last quarter, we have had several quarters of very strong growth in semiconductor measurement solutions and we expect this to moderate somewhat as we move through the remainder of the fiscal year.  EISG reported record gross margin of 61.8% and operating margin of 26.1%. Following the completion of the acquisition of Ixia on April 18, we created a new operating segment named the Ixia Solutions Group, or ISG. The reported second quarter results for ISG cover the 13-day period between the closing of the acquisition and the end of our fiscal quarter. During this time, ISG generated revenue of $12 million, gross margin of 77.1% and an operating loss of $2 million.  While Ixia was not required to and did not perform a hard close of its first quarter, which ended on March 31st, I’ll provide some color on their order performance for that period.  Ixia orders of $128 million were in line with expectations and up 4% year-over-year. Orders for Ixia's visibility solutions grew 18% year-over-year and were 28% of total orders. Ixia's test solutions order performance was in line with the prior year's first quarter, but contained a higher-mix of service and subscription orders, which are recognized as revenue over time.  Please note that we do not intend to provide Ixia's order performance on a go forward basis, but will be reporting their financial results as a separate operating segment. As Ron mentioned, our integration efforts are off to a great start, and as our integration plan has solidified, we are able to update our cost synergy timeline. We now expect to achieve annualized run-rate cost synergies of $40 million by Q3 of next fiscal year and remain committed to delivering the full $60 million of cost synergies over time.  Moving to the Services Solutions Group, SSG generated second quarter revenue of $102 million, a 6% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales for our remarketed solutions and calibration services. SSG reported gross margin of 40.9% and operating margin of 16.2%.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with $983 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash flow from operations in the quarter was $49 million, which included $60 million in acquisition-related operating cash utilization. Capital purchases were $17 million in the quarter resulting in free cash flow of $32 million.  We ended the quarter with $2.2 billion in long term debt, up $1.1 billion from the prior quarter, which we used to fund the Ixia acquisition along with equity raised in the quarter. We were able to take advantage of strong credit markets and issued $700 million in senior unsecured fixed-rate notes, with a coupon of 4.6%.  On the equity side, we raised $444 million in net proceeds by issuing approximately 13.1 million common shares priced at $35 per share, which includes the overallotment.  Before moving to guidance, we would like to discuss a few modeling items. First, we will continue to report revenue on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with the difference being the impact of the fair value adjustment to the acquired deferred revenue balance from Ixia. Based on preliminary purchase price accounting, the net deferred revenue balance inherited from Ixia is $44 million, reflecting an approximate adjustment of 70%.  Second, we currently expect interest expense to be approximately $24 million per quarter.  Third, regarding our go forward tax rate, we are in the early stages of planning how best to bring Ixia and Keysight together from a tax perspective but for the immediate future we are continuing to model a 17% non-GAAP tax rate on Keysight's profits and a 30% non-GAAP tax rate on Ixia profits, which yields a combined rate of approximately 19%.  And lastly, we expect our weighted diluted share count exiting fiscal year 2017 to be approximately 188 million shares.  Turning to our outlook and guidance for the third quarter. We currently expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $840 million to $880 million, representing 2% core growth at the midpoint. We expect third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.65, or $0.58 in the mid-point, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares.  With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instruction for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. 
Richard Eastman : Yes, good afternoon. Perhaps Neil or, I don’t know if Ron wants to take this one from a distance. But I'm a little bit curious the core order number, so excluding Ixia, the core orders were up like 14% which feels strong seasonally from Q1 to Q2. It seems like it's 3, 4, 5 points stronger than normal, and I'm curious which product lines perhaps you're seeing that strength, is it a continuation in the parametric test area or maybe you could just kind of address that?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so Rick, first of all, I checked your – I don’t know if we misstated something or if your math is wrong, we have core orders up 4% in the quarter, not 14%. Obviously, we saw strength in 5G, we saw strength in modular, we saw great strength in automotive, semi were the strong points, we saw weakness in 4G while aerospace, defense was significantly better than it was in Q1, it was below our average growth rate for Q2 orders as well. 
Richard Eastman: Well, I'm kind of talking seasonally, Neil. So in other words, from Q1 to Q2, I thought the core order number was 791 in core and you did 695 in the first quarter, typically you see barely 10% sequential order improvement. I'm just curious is that – 
Neil Dougherty: Okay, I'm with you, I got you. So if you look sequentially, one of the big drivers of sequential growth then was aerospace, defense, we've seen a 20% decline in aerospace defense orders in Q1 of last year. Now it’s year over year, right? Year over year Q1 aerospace, defense was down 20%, whereas in Q2, the numbers were closer to flat, it was actually very slightly up on a year over year basis and so the sequential improvement in aerospace defense was the significant driver of the increase. 
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay, and then just as a follow up. Within electronic and industrial, the IESG segment, the operating leverage that you delivered in the quarter and again, whether it's year over year or incremental, pretty significant, and is that mix in that segment -- and I kind of flag again maybe the semi test business, but is the incremental there a function of mix?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, that's correct. Obviously we saw really strong orders and revenue from our semi business, and that does tend to have a favorable mix impact in terms of the margin incrementals that we can deliver. So you are absolutely correct about that. 
Richard Eastman: And then lastly, and I promise no more. But there was some conversation today, Ron, in the conference presentation, really from Gigamon and they were speaking to some aggressive pricing by Ixia from time of announcement of the deal to close of a deal. And I guess what I'm just asking is as we look forward, well I’ll use your own revenue number, but is it fair to use a gross margin number for projecting Ixia, say between 77 and 78; is that –?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, that's fair. That is their historical gross margin level, and that is the level that we would expect to see from them going forward. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. 
Brandon Couillard : Ron, I was curious if you could just elaborate on the aerospace and defense dynamics in the second quarter. Directionally, you feel like the worst is behind us as far as the U.S. order trajectory.
Ron Nersesian: Well, as Neil had mentioned, we saw about a 20% decline in the first quarter, and in Q2 orders were up about 1%. So, although it didn't flush through on revenue where in Q2 revenue was down because of the Q1 orders, we did see the Q2 orders flatten out and that's nice. It’s a little hard to tell what is going to happen in the budget cycle, but we look at the number of wins that we get in our position in the aerospace defense market, and we are positioned very strongly in that space and we're very confident with where we -- how we will turn out on a competitive basis.  As far as when the budget will jump up to the next level, it's hard to say. We did say there are three ways in which the budget or we could say that orders and revenue could increase, one was to get rid of the continuing resolution; the second was an increase in the overall aerospace and defense spending where Trump was talking about $54 billion at one point but it’s up any amount, and the third was by mix being more slated towards high technology which we strongly believe will be the case due to a little bit more of a slowdown of new programs over the past eight years. So we still look forward to those three upsides, but as far as the timing it is a little unsure, but we're ready for it as soon as the government starts spending.
Brandon Couillard : And then a two-part question for you, Neil. Number one, was the Qualcomm contract win that you announced this morning included in your 5G orders in the second quarter? And then number two, the services business grew about 7% core but lapped a pretty easy comp versus last year. Is there any timing dynamic that you'd like to speak to there?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so the Qualcomm -- a portion of that Qualcomm order at least was included in our 5G orders, so that is correct, and in a minute I’ll let Mike comment on that Qualcomm win because I think it's significant. Regarding the services business, as you referenced we did have a relatively softer comp from a year ago but I wouldn't say that there's any particular timing that impacted our revenue stream here in Q2. Mike, do you want to comment on the Qualcomm win?
Mike Gasparian: Sure. Well, you could probably get the highlights from the release. They've selected us for their new 5G network emulation, the solution is going to help them validate all of their RF workflows as well as the higher layers of their protocol for 5G. We've got a great scalable solution that we announced earlier in the months going from sub-six gigahertz up to 28, 39 gigahertz and we will do a great job of transitioning our customers from pre-5G to 5G NR to whatever the final standards are.  This is a pretty significant win for us from a number of perspective. First of all, the dollars associated with the win will grow as the 5G program grows at Qualcomm and expands. Secondly, they are a big time leader in chipsets and that part of the ecosystem really plays the role of early adopter and frequently serves as a reference solution for device makers in other parts of the ecosystem. So I think we're going to get some downstream leverage. And perhaps most importantly, I think this is a really big milestone. It was about three years ago where Ron declared the growth initiatives for Keysight and one of which was we want to win in 5G. And I think this win at Qualcomm is tangible proof that we're on the right path. And I think we've established ourselves in a leadership position where we have been and we will continue to -- investing aggressively to win. We've got collaborations all around the world with the market makers that we're leveraging, and we're really well positioned to help our customers accelerate the commercialization of 5G. So it's a really exciting story that’s starting to unfold for us now.
Ron Nersesian: I’ll add just another comment – just a comment to what Mike has said. First of all, what we have won here in 5G on the protocol solution, we did not win in 4G. So this is pure incremental growth to us and Keysight being focused. The way in which we did that was we wanted to bring together the capability of Keysight with the capability of Anite and the capability at AT4. Obviously we made those two acquisitions over the last few years and the solution that we put together was by joining the best of hardware and software into a complete solution from those three companies. And that's what really made us to stand out that puts us ahead of the competition. So we're very very pleased with the progress and with the contributions that those two previous acquisitions have made.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank.
Vijay Bhagavath : My question is on 5G and connected cars as a test opportunity. Help us understand how this opportunity in terms of the solutions gets divided among your peer group? For example, would different carriers and OEMs work with different set of test suppliers? Are these end customers dual, triple, multi-sourced? And where I'm coming from is, it will help us to understand in terms of is there any lumpiness in purchases, how much visibility do you have? Would you have any pricing pressures like the service providers playing you off your competition and so on and so forth? Thanks. 
Ron Nersesian: Yeah, so obviously those two markets, the automotive market and the 5G market are in two different segments. So why don't I let Soon Chai comment first on how we see the automotive market unfolding and then Mike can make some additional 5G comments. So Soon Chai, do you want to address Vijay’s automotive question?
Gooi Soon Chai: Yes, okay. So this is Soon Chai here. I think definitely as Ron has mentioned, these are truly exciting time for the automotive segment. It's moving from a mechanical industry to electronic content industry. And if you look at the car of the future it’s really all about electronic, it’s all about connectivity, it’s all about intelligence. So this really plays very strongly to our strengths. Now our capabilities allow us to enable this major transformation in the automotive ecosystem. We provide solution in multiple areas. So firstly, we do design validation and testing of the critical automotive electronic control bots [ph] or the ECU. Okay, second is the area of connectivity, we do solution for telematics where we provide ADS solutions such as radar target simulators, B2B connectivities. And lastly we also provide solution in the power management area. Essentially these are the three points for the area [ph]. So if you look at it, it covers the whole ecosystem from digital testing to telematics all the way to power management. So we have a good momentum of this segment and definitely with strong partnership with key customers. So that’s really little bit about the automotive area. So maybe I need to pass on to Mike to talk about the 5G portion.
Mike Gasparian: Yeah, hi Vijay, I'm not sure exactly where you wanted to go with this question. I’ll make some general comments about 5G and then maybe a little bit of insight about how we manage it internally. From a 5G perspective, we continue to see acceleration of the 5G standard. Most recently the 3GPP committee pulling up 5G NR by about six months, I'm sure you know about that. That has been kind of -- in turn it's got all the global operators and it’s gearing up for large scale trials. Depending on where you are around the world, different spectrum is being utilized below six gigahertz, sometimes 28 gigahertz, maybe 39 gigahertz. So there's a lot of pressure on the chipset and the device companies from a manufacturing standpoint to be able to meet these new aggressive schedules. So that's why we've been working closely with our customers with all these collaborations and came up with this new 5G protocol R&D solution, it's scalable, cover all the global spectrum that's out there, requirements, and it's flexible enough to help people transition from wherever they're entering, this technology way, they could be pre-5G, 5G NR or eventually what the final specs will be. The other thing I'll just comment on, because the way we're structured is with the industry solution team, so Soon Chai really has a great handle on the automotive industry and energy industry. And buried within the Keysight structure we have centers of excellence. So we have -- I manage a center of excellence for high frequency measurements. I also manage one for digital and photonics. But for example, in the high frequency measurement area, that group will have expertise in millimeter wave technology, over the air testing techniques, and those centers of excellence as well as our technology leadership organization, our Keysight labs we will be able to apply that and basically provide that technology to any industry. So Soon Chai can draw on the centers of excellence from all around the company. A great example might be 77 gigahertz in automotive radar. The radar technology is primarily sitting in our high frequency measurement COE but it's accessible to and we work closely with Soon Chai’s industry group focused on automotive.
Vijay Bhagavath : You know, if I could quickly clarify, and thanks for your explanation. If I could quickly clarify, where I was coming from is, if you walked into an AT&T test lab, would they have instruments from Knotty [ph], from Keysight, maybe Rohde & Schwarz simultaneously for the same test use case, or different test use cases would be from different suppliers including yourselves? But it helps us to understand how they think of the test solutions providers in terms of use cases for these growth opportunities. 
Mike Gasparian: Well, I think there are a lot of different segments associated -- I might hand this over to Mark Wallace to see if he has any comment. He's our worldwide sales manager. But there's a lot of different segments. Certainly if you capture a win with Qualcomm, they'll develop a reference test solution for R&D that will really get handed off downstream probably to device maker, which will then parlay into operators. Now operators depending on who they are around the world are going to have different types of conformance testing. And then you'll have -- you'll kind of go from the wireless device side to a base station side and so you could have different suppliers in different parts of the ecosystem. Mark, do you have any additional comments there?
Mark Wallace: No, Mike, that's very accurate. We do work with the test houses and have actively worked with them through our relationships over the last several years. This is another area that Anite has brought a lot of strengths to us and we're going to continue to leverage that going forward. But as you say it begins at different points across the ecosystem. So as we're working early upstream with some of the chipset providers as well as the automobile manufacturers and some of the component suppliers that leverage gets propagated across the entire ecosystem, including the test houses that you're referring to.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari : Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. My first question is on your Q3 guide. If you could comment a little bit on the individual segments, how you view growth in the respective segments, that would be helpful? Thank you. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, hi Toshi, this is Neil. So obviously we don't provide specific guidance for each in the individual segments but I can touch briefly on kind of what some of the puts and takes are from a market perspective. We obviously continue to see investment in next generation technologies, 5G and automotive being two primary areas we would expect to continue to see strong growth as we move through the remainder of the fiscal year. As we touched on, we've had a very strong first half of the year in our semiconductor businesses, as not only do you see move to more advanced process nodes with the semiconductor build-out in China. We are expecting some moderation of that build-out here in the second half. Aerospace, defense could be a business that’s a bit difficult to call at this point.  On the positive side we did see the budget get passed in April, it did include incremental dollars for aerospace, defense but we know from historical data point that it does take a while to go from the passage of a budget to the actual time at which dollars start to flow. So I would expect aerospace defense to be soft again here in Q3 potentially starting to ramp in Q4 and some of those dollars will continue to get -- the dollars in the current budget will continue to get spent even as we migrate into FY’18. So that's kind of the puts and takes.  On the Ixia side, obviously the visibility business I would also mention is another high growth area. And so we’d expect to continue to see a strong growth in the visibility portion from Ixia as well in the second half of this year. I think it is important to note too that if you start to think about the second half of the year and what's included in our guidance obviously we'll be adding the Ixia expense portfolio particularly their R&D, we're continuing to invest heavily in 5G. And as we look forward we expect that our R&D investment as a company now will be close to 15.5% going forward.
Toshiya Hari : And then I have a follow up. On the commercial comm side of your business, I appreciate the fact that you're very focused on 5G and that's obviously a growth driver going forward. But I was curious what kind of activity you're seeing in 4G/ Is it stable, is it declining? And in terms of market share are you picking up share? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. 
Ron Nersesian: Yes, so let me just make a really quick comment and then I'll hand off to Mark Wallace here to add on. Obviously one of the themes that's been going on for several quarters in a row and an accelerated ramp up of investment of our customers in 5G and a ramp down of 4G spending that was happening faster than we had previously modelled, but I will let Mark to make some more specific comments. 
Mark Wallace: Yeah, that's right. So in Q2 we saw this occur, especially in Europe we saw the decline in some of the year on year business as you compared to last year for 4G dropped off substantially, that's in both the test houses, conformance test as well as some of the 4G base station build-out. So that was seen there, and we saw in other regions as well a little bit in Japan, although we did see a little bit of a recovery toward the end of the quarter with some of the components supply chain part of the business. So it's definitely a transition, it's not going to zero but it's down quite a bit.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with BoA Merrill Lynch.
Krish Sankar : Hi guys. I had a couple of them. First one, is there a way you can quantify what percentage of revenues, either in the commercial comm group or overall percentages of revenues from 4G, from 5G and how much is autos as a percentage of total revenues?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so we provide in our IR materials that are posted on our website a breakdown of our revenue across the business groups. And we do provide some level of visibility to the aerospace, defense and commercial communications breakdown. We don't provide a further breakdown of the electronic industrial business to its sub-segments. I'm just flipping pages here real quick to get it in front of me here. But you can find that data on our web. So if you look at commercial communications for Q2 it was about 34% of the total; aerospace defense was 22% of the total. Our electronic industrial business which includes general electronics, semiconductor and automotive together was 29% of the total. Ixia obviously with only thirteen days was a very small sliver at 2%, and services made up the balance of 13% of total revenue.
Krish Sankar : I was just trying to figure out if you can give exactly how much -- what percentage of 5G, specifically what percentage of auto specifically?
Neil Dougherty: No, we haven't shared this number specifically, we did in our proxy statement disclose our 5G revenue – excuse me, our 5G orders for last fiscal year. And so you could use that as a basis point from which to model. And that’s really for competitive reasons obviously these are highly competitive markets that are moving quickly and we don't want to share too much information. 
Krish Sankar : And then a little bit of a longer term question, when I look two years out, when 5G, you start getting the commercial deployment and standards definition phase, help us understand what is the opportunity for Keysight, both on the legacy Keysight business and also with Ixia, because I think you didn't have much softer revenues during the 3G and the 4G phase but with Ixia you probably have some incremental softer opportunity in 5Galso. So help us quantify what that number could look like. And just as a quick follow-on to that. The Qualcomm win, is it for legacy Keysight or is there any Ixia opportunity in that too?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, so let me just make a couple of comments and then I'll hand off to Mike and potentially Bethany for some follow-on comments. So first of all, the Qualcomm opportunity was a legacy opportunity. I think as you think about -- as you think about 5G moving forward, the nice thing about our portfolio is we really participate in the 5G ecosystem at multiple points, right all the way from pre-R&D with our ESOP tools as people are developing the chips and devices that they're going to operate in 5G -- chip components, chipset devices, base stations and then all of that is ultimately going to drive a dramatic increase in data traffic back through the data centers. And so there's an opportunity for not only our data center business and the core Keysight, but Ixia to benefit from the 5G transformation. So Mike, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.
Mike Gasparian: I’ll just make a really quick comment. Even though the Qualcomm example that we've been talking about today is in fact legacy. As Ron pointed out earlier in the call, this was not a business opportunity we were able to pursue historically when 4G occurred. It was really the confluence of the Anite acquisition and the AT4 acquisition, they're bringing the protocol expertise into Keysight combined with our RF expertise has allowed us to have more of an end-to-end solution. With that I'll turn it over to Bethany to see if she's got any comments about Ixia.
Bethany Mayer: Sure. Thanks Mike. So for Ixia, we also have a very strong opportunity in 5G as well. What we saw in the first quarter was strong wireless quarter for us and double digit sequential growth in wireless, primarily in Asia Pacific, that's where we saw it. But I would also comment that we do have several customers in other parts of the world looking at our products in 5G. And then I would also comment that Qualcomm is a customer of Ixia as well. So we do have some nice complementary capabilities across Ixia and Keysight as we and the entire industry move toward 5G.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Stanley Kovler with Citi Research.
Stanley Kovler : Thanks for taking my question. Just one more on sort of the 5G opportunity here. When you look at the prior cycles that you had on 3G and 4G, and understanding that now you start talking about a fuller solution. What I wanted to understand is, given the way that 5G looks like it will play out, at first it's going to start off as a fixed wireless solution and then dovetail into more devices or mobility type of deployment. In the past the peak cycle on 3G and 4G in terms of spending has lasted maybe two years. Should we think about a similar cycle for 5G or thinking more about like a three to five year cycle on 4G? And then I have a margin follow-up. Thank you.
Ron Nersesian: Stan, again I'll make some initial comments and then hand it off to Mike. Again we think of these cycles as far longer than two or three years given that we really come in on the front end, as we sell into R&D solutions and that's more true today in 5G than it even was in prior generations. And so right now here we are, we still don't even have 5G standards developed yet and we have a very strong engagement in 5G. And so we do view these as far longer cycles than that. Certainly there's going to be a ramp as you start to look towards standards deployment either in – or standard definition either in ’18 or early ‘19 and then commercial rollout in the early 2010 timeframe. But Mike, I will leave it to you to add any additional commentary. 
Mike Gasparian: Yes, just a quick clarification on the model that you threw out. First of all, I would agree with Neil’s comment and maybe Mark wants to add something in here. I would view the peak 5G cycle as a much longer worldwide deployment than just two or three years. The second thing, and coming back to this worldwide dimension of the opportunity, fixed wireless is taking a very strong lead here in the U.S. with both Verizon and AT&T. But if you look in the international markets, in Asia in particular, most of the action is at sub-6 gigahertz, and with massive MIMO, as kind of a primary challenge. So if you look across the different 5G deployments, you see over-the-air challenges, beamforming challenges, massive MIMO, I mean this standard really is a -- it takes it up a step function on multiple dimensions, different frequencies and it just leads to a plethora of measurement opportunities for us to make contributions, right? It's largely uncharted territory whether it's sub-6 gigahertz with massive MIMO, or if it's a 28, 39 gigahertz millimeter wave opportunity, this is all new ground for our customers. Mark, do you have anything else to add?
Mark Wallace: Mike, I would just add to just build on what you just said, unlike 4G and certainly 3G, there's just such a larger breadth of opportunities that 5G is playing into. From the things that you mentioned to low power low latency IoT applications, medical applications, we talked about automotive and how these industries are colliding, it affects the backhaul of data centers. So it's more than just pushing more through a wireless pipe, it's more than just streaming Netflix. It's about a whole number of different use models that are first of all completely global, this is happening everywhere in the world. And it's touching all these different areas where Keysight is participating and being dominant. So it's definitely more than a couple three years. If you think back from 2G to 3G to 4G, that occurred over a 20, 30 year period. So I expect this to be longer than just that couple of years.
Stanley Kovler : Thanks. If I could just follow up in terms of the gross margin outlook for next quarter, if you bake into the numbers, I’d land somewhere in the low 60s range if I'm correctly blending in the Ixia and Keysight margins. And so that puts me above the range of where you typically operated obviously. Could you just help us revisit how we should think about the gross margin line going forward? Typically you’ve gotten to these levels or near these levels at significantly higher revenue in the past? Thank you. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So obviously we don't guide the individual line items. But let me make a couple of comments, that might help you. So first of all, you're correct. Obviously we're going to benefit from adding -- on the gross margin line we're going to benefit from the addition of Ixia. You are right, you're adding on an annualized basis approximately $500 million of incremental revenue that has gross margin in the very high 70s in terms of where Ixia operates. So that's going to be a net-adder to the Keysight who has traditionally operated in the high 50s.  Now within Keysight’s portfolio we have a wide range of margins generally speaking. Our sales into R&D -- our customers R&D labs come with a higher gross margin than sales into manufacturing. Certain product lines, we talked about semi today having a favorable mix benefit from a gross margin perspective. But I think if you look historically at Keysight’s results we've operated in a pretty tight band, two to three percentage point band and Ixia has been operating in a similarly type band albeit roughly 20 points higher in total. And so I think your math is more or less correct and it's the type of thing you should expect from us as we move forward.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad from Credit Suisse. 
Farhan Ahmad : Can you just talk about 5G? You talked about more than 100% growth in autos this year. How sustainable do you think that is? And secondly, you are getting a decline from 4G and a growth from 5G. When do you think we get to a point that the 5G growth actually starts to become bigger than the decline that you're seeing in 4G?
Ron Nersesian: Yes, so obviously we did put up triple digit growth here again in 5G and we saw a very strong growth in 5G last fiscal year as well. As for the sustainability, obviously we're benefiting somewhat, that we’re at the very early stages of a ramp and so the numbers are still relatively small. But we certainly expect that 5G is going to continue to ramp aggressively. Now the growth rates are going to come down over time as the base goes up, but we're still at the very front end of a 5G ramp with -- still in a stage prior to standards developments, or standard definition. And so there is an awful lot of 5G runway that is out there.  As you said, the 4G business is falling off and it's resulted in a commercial communication segment for us that has been more or less flat last quarter anyway from an orders perspective. And so what you're really seeing is 5G, the next generation data center technology is offsetting the roll-off in 4G spending. Mike, I don’t know if you have any further comments on that as well.
Mike Gasparian: Well, no, I just think it's obvious that at some point in time in the future 5G is going to eclipse 4G. I mean that's not too hard to imagine. So we definitely think that's going to happen. Exactly when, I don't -- I can't -- I don't think it's completely modeled out nor would we share it at this point in time. But what I can say is our 4G sales I think feel like they're stabilizing. And also I don't think we’re going to see dramatic fall off from this run rate. And the 5G number continues to grow. So it's kind of a foregone conclusion that 5G will eclipse 4G going forward.
Farhan Ahmad : And then can you just talk about your progress with some of the international customers on 5G? There is a big push in China for 5G. So maybe specific to China, how is your progress there in the markets for 5G?
Mark Wallace: Yeah, I'll take that. This is Mark. So progress in China is great. And part of this has to do with some decisions that we made as a company seven years ago in China as we started to see the changing landscape there, which is shifting from a manufacturing focus to an R&D focus. So we've been engaging with local indigenous companies in China, multinational companies in China. There's a lot of leadership coming out of China today with a number of companies and we're very well positioned. The collaborations that Mike talked about before, the example that we provided today with Qualcomm is representative of a lot of the work that we're doing around the world. And China is high in place for that. Also, as we mentioned before with the investments being made in developing local semiconductor capabilities and the foundries that feed into these industries, we’re also very well prepared there as well. So it's going quite well.
Ron Nersesian: This is Ron. Just another comment along those lines, we’ve worked with Datong [ph] and they are the ones that sit on the standards bodies in China where that standards body for instance have to be -- you have to be from China to be on it. But it’s more an advisory member to them and we've been working with them for a while on 5G. Another one is Spreadtrum there about a month ago, and we've opened up a joint innovation lab that really helps out and helps the direction of 5G. Another one I was just visiting was SMIC, we have a partnership with SMIC and we put together a memo of understanding for collaborating which will move into 5G also. So we are working at the highest levels with the market makers in China to influence the standards and to be the solution provider of choice.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo. 
Jess Lubert : Hi guys, thanks for squeezing me in and congrats on a nice quarter here. I am not going to ask you about 5G. So maybe just a couple on the Ixia deal, and I was hoping you can maybe help us understand some of the factors leading you to believe you can capture the $40 million of cost synergies quicker than you originally expected, where those savings are likely to come from, and given it sounds like you're seeing some early success there, to what extent do you think you have a chance to upside the original goal of $50 million in 24 months and $60 million in three years?
Ron Nersesian: So it is a great question. I appreciate the opportunity to provide more details. So obviously the acquisition has been closed for a little over a month at this point, and that's a month that we've spent really working hard to solidify and define the integration plan that we're going to be putting in place over the course of the next nine to twelve months, and to make sure that the assumptions that we had made about where we could get cost synergies from the combination of the two companies that those assumptions were correct, and making sure that we still had line of sight to the $60 million. So again six weeks or seven weeks post close of the acquisition, very confident in our ability to ultimately get to that $60 million and as you noted we're pulling forward the timeline on how quickly we're going to be able to get the first $40 million. We're not at this point ready to commit to upside but we do have a direct line of sight to that first $40 million and are working on a plan to get that out over the first twelve months.  If you look at where that's coming from, it's a combination of supply chain efficiencies as well as operating expense efficiencies primarily as we look to bring the two IT environments together. So those are the number one things that we will be working on here. The costs are coming out of -- from both sides of the equations. We're leveraging the best of both companies as we bring them together and are very pleased at what we have found as far as opportunities this far into our integration planning. 
Jess Lubert : And then just in a similar regard, can you talk to us a little bit about how you're feeling about the revenue opportunity and what are you hearing from the combined sales team, channels, customers, about your ability to kind of cross pollinate the products from Keysight into the Ixia base and vice versa, and some of the incremental opportunities that could drive over the next few years?
Neil Dougherty: So that’s a great question. And just as we're off and running on working on identifying the cost energy opportunities, we're similarly off and running on generating revenue synergies. As you know, we have communicated previously we really identified three areas where we expect to get revenue synergies. One is from leveraging the breadth and the international scope of Keysight’s field to provide qualified leads to the Ixia team, and then there are some sub-segments of the market where that actually works the reverse direction, where Ixia’s relative strengths are going to provide opportunities for Keysight. Then there's an opportunity for us to accelerate the investment in the channel for specifically as it relates to pursuing the visibility opportunity, the fast growing visibility opportunity, and then finally bringing the two technologies together to bring new solutions to market.  In just a minute, I will let Bethany comment on her perspective on how that's going kind of one month in. The one point that I did want to make is we do expect to publish our 10-Q tomorrow and that will include some historical revenue numbers for the combined companies for both the prior six months -- the first six months of FY’17 but a pro forma compared to FY’16 as well, so you'll be able to see those numbers in our Q and it drops tomorrow. Bethany, would you care to comment on the revenue synergy opportunity as you see it six weeks after the close of the transaction?
Bethany Mayer: Sure. Happy to; thanks for the question. So I think it's going very well both within Ixia as well as Keysight. And we've identified some great opportunities, one as Neil had mentioned is that there are opportunities for Keysight sales force to help Ixia’s sales force engage in customers where we haven't been. And vice versa on our side of the equation there are opportunities where we have a very -- key relationship in certain customers that we can engage to help Keysight. And so that activity is -- we're pursuing that very heavily.  The second one is the go-to-market activity and basically that's an investment on the part of Keysight into Ixia’s go to market and our channel to centrally leverage the channel that we have and grow that. And so we're very excited about that, because we have an opportunity for a double digit continued growth on the visibility side of our product portfolio and that will really aid us in that growth opportunity.  And then on the technology areas of potential revenue synergy, there are three key areas that we focus on together as a combined company. One is in the data center with high speeds. As you know we are the network test market leader for 400 gig and we came out with the first 400 gig PEM-4 QDD test product that is on the market today. And it's very exciting for us and for our customer base. And so we're able to combine our capabilities in the data center with Keysight for some really interesting opportunities across the board. We also see opportunities in 5G with a combination of Ixia and Anite, some great end-to-end solution opportunities that we're already engaging customers and we're even getting pull from the field on these opportunities.  And then the last one is in IoT automotive and handheld, we have products that are meant to test Wi-Fi particularly for IoT. We're very well positioned in that space and we also have test products in automotive Ethernet and both of these areas are very strong for Keysight and Ixia and we have identified some potential combined product solutions that literally can be sold to the market now, as well as for future we have a small amount of R&D that we can apply to create something even more differentiated. So there's a lot of opportunity here and we're very excited about this. And we think that combined companies, both very strong companies, have a lot to offer in the market and can really make an impact. End of Q&A

Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We will focus today's discussion on four key topics. First, we delivered a strong first quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.57 per share above the midpoint of our guidance and revenue of $726 million at the midpoint of our guidance. Second, in the aerospace defense market, we saw funding delays in the U.S., which impacted orders and revenue in the quarter. While we expect to see headwinds in this end market for the next few quarters, we are confident in our long-term opportunities for growth when the funding resumes. Third, outside of aerospace defense, we achieved double-digit organic order growth driven by continued momentum in next-generation technologies. Our growth on multiple fronts of several emerging trends gives us confidence that our strategy is working and Keysight's transformation is well underway. And fourth, we are further accelerating the execution of our strategy and transformation with the proposed acquisition of Ixia, which we announced two weeks ago. Let's begin with a brief overview of Keysight's first quarter performance. We are pleased with our results in execution in the quarter. We delivered $726 million in revenue at the midpoint of our guidance, and achieved earnings of $0.57 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. We achieved 2% order growth despite unexpected aerospace and defense funding delays in the U.S. While we remain cautious on the timing of the finding for the next few quarters, we are very confident in our leadership position including a number of recent program wins. Excluding aerospace and defense, orders grew 11% year-over-year organically. Our growth was driven by the continuation of the trends we have discussed in previous quarters, including 5G, IoT, high-speed data centers, wireless LAN and the electric car. We are still in the very early stages of these emerging technologies, and believe Keysight is best positioned to help these industries move forward. Our focus on bringing solutions to market that helps customers accelerate their next-generation designs across the communications ecosystem is allowing us to drive multiple avenues of growth across these trends. We are pleased with the momentum and believe the Keysight transformation for growth is well underway. In 5G, our growth continues to track ahead of expectations. Our collaboration with major universities and research centers around the globe are fully underway. In December, Keysight and the University of California San Diego demonstrated a bidirectional 60-gigahertz link for 5G applications and achieved gigabit per second speeds at previously unachieved ranges. The demonstration included advances in millimeter-wave technology that provide critical proof of concepts for 5G including the fixed broadband use case at the center of many pre-standardization efforts. The 5G ecosystem is broadening beyond universities and research institutions to chipset players, device developers and mobile operators. While 5G standards have yet to be established, full design and development efforts are driving material R&D investments as large device makers retool their labs for millimeter-wave commercialization and high-speed digital interfaces. Millimeter-wave applications at higher frequencies can deliver far more throughout and speed, but 5G is about more than just consumer applications such as streaming mobile video, pervasive ultra reliable and low latency over-the-air communications are also critical tenants of 5G. This is to support large IoT deployments and machine-to-machine communications as more and more devices become smarter, automated and connected including trucks, cars, smart homes and medical devices. Given our deep heritage and leadership in RF, microwave and millimeter-wave design and test, our increased focus on software solutions that enable rapid prototyping and the broad range of solutions we have available today, Keysight is well positioned to lead the market as these next-generation technologies evolve and converge. In recognition of our leadership position in IoT, Frost & Sullivan recently awarded Keysight with the 2016 Global Test & Measurement for IoT Company of the Year Award. Keysight has a broad portfolio of solutions to help designers fast track IoT deployment and many 5G applications. Later this month at Mobile World Congress, we will showcase many of our solutions that help designers transform their ideas into reality from simulation, to prototype, to manufacturing and optimization. In order to demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio, I would like to share with you just a few of the solutions we planned to showcase at Mobile World Congress. First, our NarrowBand-IoT testing solution. This industry-first solution helps designers accelerate the deployment of IoT technology and optimize designs for critical performance attributes, including power consumptions, RF performance, interoperability and conformance test cases. Second, Keysight's 5G fronthaul monitoring solution that brings next-level capabilities to mobile operators and the real-time dashboard. Third, our 5G Wideband Real-Time Beamforming Reference Solution that empowers researchers to quickly and accurately test analog, digital and hybrid beamforming systems including the transmission of massive MIMO with beamforming technology. Fourth, our new 802.11ax solution that supports up to 8x8 MIMO and drives greater test efficiency, enabling R&D engineers the ability to quickly validate their new devices and drive greater test and manufacturing efficiency. And lastly, our Virtual Drive Test Toolset (sic) [Virtual Drive Testing Toolset] from our Anite team, which is an automated field-to-lab test solution that replicates drive test conditions and now is extended to help cost effectively verify wireless connectivity in the connected car. All the data traffic created at the network edge from higher speeds in the growing number of connected devices requires upgrades across the network including data centers. In the first quarter, we continued to see strong growth from our optical and high-speed 100-gig digital test solutions along with initial 400-gig investments. We also launched new products targeted for the data center, including a high performance bit error rate tester for electrical and optical PAM-4 transmitters and receivers. And this month, we launched a new sampling oscilloscope solution for 100-gigabit per second PAM-4 signals. Whether it is for high-speed datacenters, next generation mobile networks, radar, avionics, automobiles or medical devices, Keysight's solutions go where the electronic signal goes, from design simulation, to prototype validation, to manufacturing test, to optimization in the network. And now, with the proposed acquisition of Ixia, we are broadening our reach within and beyond the communications development lifecycle. Our reach will include electrical signals as well as packetized data, applications and network security. This acquisition also creates a new powerful innovation engine and end-to-end partner for the development of next-generation technologies and optimizing and securing networks; expanding our number of touch points with long-term technology trends and accelerating our transformation for growth. Keysight's wireless leadership, combined with Ixia's leadership in network test and visibility, will allow us to address the entire communications and networking sphere and move Keysight into network operations. Ixia is a pioneer and true innovator in testing IP networks. The company has consistently been first to market in leading-edge technologies, including high-speed Ethernet up to 400 gig. Our complementary technologies and world-class talent, together with our increased scale, will create new opportunities for growth and market penetration that will enable us to lead in our served markets. This acquisition is 100% complementary to Keysight, and is in direct alignment with our growth initiatives, including expanding our portfolio of software-centric solutions. Ixia's solutions have significant software content as evidenced by the fact that 90% of their R&D engineering staff are software engineers and result in the company's very high gross margin profile. In closing, we believe our strategy to align the company with the growth segments of our markets is working. We've invested in the right areas of the market at the right time and we continue to execute on our strategy. We still have lots of work ahead to complete our transformation, but we are excited to see the initial results from our continued commitment and execution. Our strong innovation and solutions portfolio position us well for growth as these long-term trends continued to evolve and customers increased the development of next-generation technologies. With the acquisition of Ixia, we are further accelerating our transformation for growth and creating a powerful innovation engine and end-to-end partner for the development of next-generation technologies and optimizing and securing networks. Now, I will turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q1 financial results as well as our second quarter guidance.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter revenue of $726 million, which was at the midpoint of our guidance and in line with the same period last year. On a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions, revenue was flat year-over-year. Regionally, core revenue declined 5% in the Americas, increased 4% in Europe and increased 3% in Asia, excluding Japan. Core revenue was flat in Japan. Looking at our operational results, gross margin was 57.5%, a year-over-year increase of 90 basis points. For the quarter, operating expenses totaled $289 million, up 2.3% over last year. This resulted in first quarter operating margin of 17.7% compared with 17.8% last year. We reported net income of $98 million or $0.57 per share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range and $0.02 above the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, includes two primary end markets. First is the commercial communications end market that reported revenue of $254 million, up 2% compared with last year's first quarter, driven by growth from 5G and next-generation data center technologies, offset by continued cautious spending across the wireless device value chain. CSG also includes our aerospace, defense and government end markets, which generated revenue of $180 million in Q1 compared with $191 million in the same quarter last year. As Ron mentioned, delayed funding in the U.S. impacted first quarter revenue and orders. As expected, we continued to see a stable but lower level of spending in our aerospace defense business in Russia and China. In total, aerospace and defense orders declined by approximately 20% over the first quarter of last year. We expect to see continued headwinds for at least the next two quarters as even after new budgets are approved, spending will take time to resume. This brought total CSG revenue for the quarter to $434 million compared with $440 million in the same quarter last year. CSG reported gross margin of 60.5% and operating margin of 16.7%. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated first quarter revenue of $192 million compared with $191 million in the same quarter last year. Growth in Semiconductor Measurement Solutions was offset by a decline in General Electronics Measurement. Automotive & Energy Solutions were flat year-over-year. As you know, we've had three quarters of very strong growth in Semiconductor Measurement, but we expect this to moderate in the back half of the fiscal year. EISG reported gross margin of 59.9% and operating margin of 21.7%. Lastly, the Services Solutions Group, or SSG, generated first quarter revenue of $100 million, a 5% year-over-year increase. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales from our calibration and remarketed solutions. SSG reported gross margin of 39.4% and operating margin of 14.4%. As Ron highlighted, overall, we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the first quarter. We delivered revenue at the mid-point of our guidance despite some challenging market dynamics, and we had solid improvement in the targeted growth areas of our markets. Our total order growth was 2%, or 11% when excluding aerospace and defense. We remained within our operating model, delivering 17.7% operating margin and reported non-GAAP net income after tax of $98 million or $0.57 per share. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow; we ended our first quarter with $896 million in cash and cash equivalents, up $113 million when compared with the $783 million at our fiscal year-end in October. We generated $102 million in cash flow from operations in the quarter and we invested $16 million in capital purchases. This brings our free cash flow for the quarter to $86 million or 12% of revenue, an improvement of over 380 basis points compared to last year. Before we move to guidance, we would like to remind you of certain modeling items we discussed on the last quarterly earnings call. For FY 2017, other operating income is projected to be $15 million, in line with last year, but pension and benefit expense is increasing by approximately $20 million versus FY 2016. Annual salary increases became effective December 1, 2016, which means that Q1 reflected a partial impact and the April quarter will reflect the salary increases for the full quarter. Additionally, we're investing in incremental field resources and have restructured our sales compensation plan with a higher variable component to drive engagement. We're investing consistently in the key growth areas of our markets to drive the long-term growth of our business, while staying within the operating model we have laid out in the past. As a reminder, our operating model delivers 40% incremental operating margin when we achieve 4% revenue growth or above. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the second quarter. Balancing the dynamics we see in the market, we currently expect Q2 revenue to be in the range of $720 million to $760 million, representing 1% growth at the midpoint on both a core and reported basis. We expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.68, or $0.61 at the midpoint based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 174 million shares. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason A. Kary - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Neil. Operator, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: And the first question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, Ron and Neil. Thank you for taking my questions. I want to make sure that I'm calc-ing this aerospace and defense order correctly. It looks like the push outs costs you about $50 million in orders. So, can you confirm that's ballpark? And then, can you just help us understand are there any specific projects that these delays are tied to, or is it relatively broad-based?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, with regard to your first question on aerospace defense, it's less than $50 million but not dramatically so. And can you repeat the second part of your question for me there, Patrick?
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I was just wondering if there's any specific programs that this is tied to, that you're seeing push outs or is this just broad-based funding?
Michael C. Gasparian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. This is Mike Gasparian. Let me give a little bit of color on that. About half of the decline was anticipated. It's related to our business in China and Russia. It's actually been a stable business for us for the last several quarters, but it is down from year ago compares. Russia, that's political sanctions, and in China, we're really in the early years of the new five-year plan where spending is always lower than the final year of a five-year plan, which completed last year. So, the dramatic decline that we saw was really focused on the U.S. and was largely unanticipated. It's really a temporary issue. Clearly, it's due to the change in the administration. The government operating under continuing resolution and the lack of any budget appropriations. As you might remember, continuing resolution is not scheduled to expire until April. It does limit spending to about 80% of last year's level on any multi-year programs and it doesn't allow spending on any new programs. In addition, Patrick, there's been a lot of uncertainty in the primes over a potential changes that could occur in procurement policies and processes under the new administration. So, add all those factors up and we think we're in for a several quarters that are soft before spending gets back on track. What is pretty clear was is that when the new budgets do get approved and appropriations get going, we're convinced that spending under the new administration is going to be higher than under the old administration. We do have a strong funnel, and we're really well positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities we see in this segment going forward.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. And just one clarification on that. So, of the slightly less than $50 million in order push outs, you're saying half was anticipated and half is attributable to the delays in spending in the U.S.
Michael C. Gasparian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Perfect. And just pertaining to 5G, you had a recent filing where that pointed out your 5G order flow in 2016, in fiscal year 2016, that was quite impressive. I'm wondering how we should think about expectations for order growth in FY 2017. And if you could help us understand what key products or technologies within the 5G bucket are really driving that growth?
Michael C. Gasparian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: So, Patrick, looks like I'm going to be your guy again. So, what I say about 5G is, it's a great example of next-generation technology that really helped us achieve that 11% organic growth this quarter for the company. Orders continue to exceed our expectations. We had another strong quarter, a very strong double-digit growth over last year's Q1. We've put in place these new industry teams under Ron. We're cultivating our exclusive, collaborations and partnerships with universities, research institutions, key players all around the world in different parts of this ecosystem. And you combine those engagements with, I'll call it, a very aggressive 5G investment profile and they're really starting to pay dividends for us. We've had strategic wins in a number of areas and we've seemed to be pretty well positioned to win as this 5G spending starts to accelerate going forward. There's a lot of field trials coming from operators, a lot of us have heard about Verizon. They've got a fixed wireless 28-gigahertz trial going on in late 2017. But Korea Telecom, NTT DOCOMO, CMCC in China, all of these trials are really catalysts for investments by chipset companies and device makers. And we're seeing really good engagement, particularly on the R&D side, right? R&D new technology it's still a very restrictive CapEx environment. But in these pockets, people are spending money and we are winning some of these early deals. So, we've got a great opportunity for share gains compared to where we were in 4G. And then you have another dimension of 5G coming, which is all about IoT, right? And so that kind of adds into the excitement about 5G. Maybe the quick summary would be that, we don't really see a lot about timing changing. We see a steady buildup activity through 2017 and 2018, and really commercial deployment in 2019 or 2020 timeframe. So that part of it hasn't changed a whole lot.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Patrick, one other point that I'll add is that, when 4G was being rolled out, we were organized around product divisions. And we were behind the competition. We are focused for 3.5 years ever since we made the decision to split off from Agilent in the last two-plus years since we've been a public company on making sure that we win in these spaces, especially in R&D, which is the first place where you would see revenue flow. We now, as you know, have a new organization and we have a group that is focused on commercial communications that reports in to Mike, as well as aerospace defense, but in commercial communications, what they do is, they bring all the hardware products, software products and, in total, a complete solution to the customer. So, when I had mentioned earlier about NarrowBand-IoT solutions and other, we have the organization setup so they can pull all the pieces that are necessary and bring them to the customer. And what we're finding is a much, much higher win rate than we found in the past. So, the timing for 5G, we've talked about that in the past and that hasn't changed that much, except the race is on and people are accelerating their overall programs, but the key thing is our competitiveness is much stronger than it used to be.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for the details. And just last one is for Neil. I guess, given some of the rating agencies have posted opinions on the Ixia transaction, when we think about the equity component to close the Ixia acquisition, do you think it's more or less likely at this point that you use equity?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. We haven't provided any further details on our financing plan. As we indicated we had put a bridge financing in place, there's no financing contingency for the Ixia transaction. We will determine the ultimate take out of that bridge in the coming months. We'd obviously like to do that in advance of the close of the transaction, but the specific mix has not been determinant at this point in time. In terms of parameters, as I said, and when we made the Ixia announcement, we're very much focused on maintaining our investment grade credit ratings. We're working with the agencies to understand what limits that puts us on in terms of our ability to add further leverage. Suffice it to say that the vast majority of the purchase price will be made up from incremental debt funding and current cash on the balance sheet. And if there is any equity component, it will be a minority share.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. First one for Ron. I think Neil spoke to some changes in the variable comp structure with the sales force, and I think you may have also spiked out some field sales head count expenses. Could you elaborate sort of where those are targeted and what the effect is on the operating expenses if this is layered in next few quarters?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Hi, Brandon. This is Ron. When we look at the total spend, there's two things that we would like to do as we've really tried to make sure that we grow faster. One is to make sure that our R&D development engine is working on the right products and working more quickly so we have more mass behind them in order to be successful. And then the second goal is to make sure that we beef up our sales organization, and in particular our direct sales organization so that we can win, and also win where we compete and that we can also go ahead and have more broad coverage. So, both of those things are where we're putting more and more of a percentage of our revenue, and the other areas we're looking to continuously pare back and become more efficient. Some of them as we grow, we will not expand and other ones we're looking for basically cost savings to fund that area. When you look at the field sales organization, there are people that are out that are doing direct selling and then we have folks that are doing support. We're trying to become much more efficient in our sales support, so that we can go ahead and put a higher percentage of our sales cost or sales investment towards direct selling efforts to accelerate growth. I'm going turn it over to Mark Wallace, who is the Head of our Sales Organization, to give you a little more detail.
Mark Wallace - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Ron. Brandon, Ron covered it really well. I think there's three areas I would call out in terms of where we're increasing focus. The first is on really capturing all this new technology development, and in particular increasing our solutions selling capacity and capability. So, that's one area. The second is around reach and growing our coverage of all of the emerging accounts and territories and geographies around each of the regions. And then the third one is around services. That's a key area of focus for us. We're increasing our head count in that area and focus on selling services in alignment with the company's strategy. So that's the kind of the areas of focus for us. And now, I'll ask Neil to make a couple comments on the financials.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, the specific part that you're trying to get with the financial impact of the change. So, as Ron indicated, we're trying to focus on our investment on areas we'll drive growth with it while staying within the overall operating models. You're seeing a shift from other expense lines and in COGS into R&D and into the field at a macro level. I think the other impact, specific impact of the field compensation change is, you potentially see a more dramatic seasonality from costs lower in Q1 and Q3, and higher in Q2 and Q4. And there's really two things that are driving that. Obviously, we've increased the variability of our field compensation structures and our orders tend to be higher in those two quarters. But our fields are paid essentially on a quota performance for half. And so, as they move through the half, they can get essentially higher and higher commission rates as they get closer to or eventually above their quota. And so, they're earning at lower rates in Q1 and Q3, earning at higher rates in Q2 and Q4, and then you have the impact of the absolute – with typical seasonality would be for higher levels of orders in Q2 and Q4 versus Q1 and Q3.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. That was very helpful. Thank you. And then, one more for Neil, two-part question. Number one, can you quantify the effect of the headwind of the China Lunar New Year in the first quarter? And then secondly, as we look at the revenue guidance for 2Q, plus 1% core at the midpoint. If we strip out aerospace and defense, what would that core growth look like in 2Q next year?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, maybe I'll make the first comment with regard to Chinese New Year. Obviously, Chinese New Year was something that we have forecasted. We obviously know the timing and we forecasted. We generally think of it is having an impact of somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million impact on revenue. And I think the expectation or the result this year were in line with our expectation. With regard to the guide for next quarter, obviously we don't breakdown the growth rate by specific segments. As I said, we do expect aerospace and defense to continue to be softer at least the next couple of quarters given the dynamics that are happening here around the change of administration in the U.S. as well as kind of the uncertainty that Mike mentioned around China and Russia.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: One other thing...
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: All right. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: ...that wasn't mentioned when we talk about the overall mix. Our Services business continues to do very well with 11% order growth in Q1 and 5% revenue growth, but we're really starting to see some good traction there, and that is part of our long-term model.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yes, great. Thank you. Ron, could you may be just address kind of growth on the modular instrument side, and have you been able to kind of maintain that double-digit growth rate that we've seen on a trailing basis? And then second part to the same question, is that being driven by the Comms business or are we seeing the Industrial business maybe drive some of the modular growth?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Sure, Richard. Well, first of all, in the future, we're not planning to be talking about modular, and the reason is this. We've shifted the way we're focusing for growth as opposed to focusing on particular products and talking about what are the customer sets we're dealing with and how do we grow each of the customer sets around the Communications Solutions Group or the Electronic Industrial set or the Services customers. And that way, we're really making sure that we optimize the overall growth and not trying to just push on particular products whether or not they need it, customers need it. So, that's why we've shifted all of our growth initiatives along these vectors and we're not talking about module. I will say, though, that last quarter just to give you the last data point, we grew roughly 20% in modular and certainly the Communications businesses is a good part of that.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Yeah.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: The only other point that I would add and further on reason for the change is the modular strategy, the software strategy are now fully integrated into the way our businesses think about winning in their marketplaces. And when we first started adopting modular as the strategy, we had to drive it through the organization. It now has critical math, it has critical mind share across the organization. So, it's not something that we're having to drive specific focus on as an organization.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: The organizations are going ahead and before they would always start with the feature-rich box and then talk about down deploying at the modular, now we're seeing in certain cases, certain products and solutions are coming first in modular, because of the ability and the time to market to get there. But of course, in a lot of cases that's not the best solution for the customer. So, it does come out in feature-rich boxes, but Neil has hit it right on the head. We feel very comfortable with the way that we are focusing on Solutions including software, modular, feature-rich boxes, services and that's really becoming a differentiator for us, especially with the well-established leadership companies.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I understand. And then, within the EIS&G (sic) [EISG] segment of the group, the auto energy solutions was flattish. And I'm curious is there a lot of positioning going on right now by Keysight in those markets? To some degree, we're kind of expecting the pickup more over the next year to two years. But I'm curious maybe how you view the flattish growth in kind of those key focus markets?
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Well, first of all, there's two areas in particular that we're focusing on and that is on automotive and power. And both of those markets, we saw really nice order growth in that area or in those areas during the last quarter on the order side. The third area is semiconductor. And semiconductor, when we look at parametric test, we have very high market share and we do a real good job of working on the leading-edge node technologies. Those technologies though when we look at semiconductor, sometimes it's fair and build out, sometimes it's not. But the automotive and the power side are the two areas where we're focusing and seeing some leadership. I'm going to turn it over to Gooi Soon Chai, who is the President of that group.
Soon Chai Gooi - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. So, maybe I can elaborate a little bit about the EISG business. As what Ron mentioned, the two major driver for EISG really revolves around the automotive, power segment and also the semi segment. And for Q1, in fact, we see almost a double-digit growth for both of these segments from order perspective. Okay? And reflecting back to your question on automotive, we definitely see it as a growing segment. And this is, as you know, fueled by the increased electrification of cars. And I believe that this play directly into our strength. We are now leveraging a lot of our car capabilities to enable, what I would call, the digitization of cars. And if you look at the bus solutions that we bring to bear, that includes solution around telematics, solution around ECU testing, solution around what we call the advanced driver assist system (sic) [advanced driver assistance system] so that include things like radar tracking for instance and all the way to battery testing. So, at this point, it's still a relatively small business, but it is growing, and we definitely see from auto perspective, a double-digit growth in Q1.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: I got you. Okay. Great. And then, Neil just one really quick question. In the Comms segment, did the decline in the A&D segment of comps, did that influence the operating margin there?
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Not dramatic...
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Negatively.
Neil P. Dougherty - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Yeah. Not dramatically. Obviously, the overall absolute level of revenues being down as a result of having lower aerospace defense puts pressure on margins relative to absolute higher levels of margin, but we do not notice a materially different gross margin profile in aerospace defense versus commercial comms.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: I just want to circle back to one comment that or one question that Patrick asked. He asked the question with regard to Ixia financing, it's a good idea, I think, to give you one another comment. Since we announced the deal two weeks ago, myself and some of the key leaders from Keysight have had a chance to spend time talking with the employees down in Calabasas, approximately 400. And then also traveling to Austin, Texas to another site with roughly a couple hundred Ixia employees and sharing with them, what our plans are and how we plan to make a stronger company together and I'm even more excited now than I was before. The response from the employees has been very positive. And then on top of that, I've had one-on-one with the top 10 executives in the company to talk about themselves and their roles as we go forward. But things look very exciting. We are very happy with what we see. The other question that comes up at times, we have revenue synergies and cost synergies. I would like to say that we're very confident in the revenue synergies and what we have shared. We have bottoms-up plans that are much greater than that, but we think when we look at the overall street plan for Ixia and then did our analysis with our financial advisor and then added the revenue and the cost synergies that we paid, a very fair price that can create enormous value for Keysight shareholders. But I'll throw out one other data point for you. Even if the revenue synergies were zero when we just achieved the cost synergies, we would be above our whack. Now that's not our goal, but it just gives you an idea of how excited we are.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary.
Jason A. Kary - Keysight Technologies, Inc.: Thank you, Mariama. And thank you everyone for joining us today. That's all we have. So, have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ronald Nersesian : Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We will focus today’s discussion on three key topics. First, we delivered a strong fourth quarter with revenue at the high end of our guidance; achieved earnings of $0.64 per share; and generated $124 million in free cash flow. Second, customers continue to increase investment in next generation technologies and Keysight continues to innovate and expand its leadership in these important areas of the market. Third, during Fiscal Year 2016, the team executed well on its strategy to transform and position the company for growth, and we made measureable progress on our key growth initiatives. Let’s begin with a brief overview of Keysight’s fourth quarter performance. We are pleased with our results and execution in the quarter. We achieved earnings of $0.64 per share, generated $124 million in free cash flow, or 17% of revenue, and delivered $751 million in revenue which was at the high end of our guidance. Additionally, orders grew 3% year-over-year to reach $806 million, which is the highest level we have seen in the past four years. Neil will provide you with further detail on our fourth quarter financial results in a few minutes. Moving to our markets, overall the dynamic we saw in the quarter remained relatively consistent with our expectations. We continue to see softness in the broader communications market and in certain regions within Europe, while investments in the development of next generation technologies continued to grow. More specifically, we saw increased investment in the areas of 5G, wireless LAN, high speed optical networks for data centers, automotive, alternative energy, and leading edge semiconductor process technologies. In 5G major players continued to accelerate development and timelines around the globe and we generated strong growth for our 5G solutions in the fourth quarter.  To highlight the growing momentum around 5G, I would like to note several recent industry announcements. NTT announced plans to begin its 5G trials in Japan as early as May, 2017. Just last week, Korea Telecom declared that it aims to be the first to commercialize 5G in 2019, which is one year ahead of its previously stated plans. China Mobile has deployed a wideband massive MIMO site on its network in Shanghai, and Verizon announced it is moving forward with its plans for 5G pilots beginning in 2017. Utilizing spectrum at very high frequencies is a key tenet behind 5G as mobile providers look for ways to cope with expanding amounts of mobile traffic, proliferation of connected devices, and the Internet of Things as well as to improve its overall customer experience. For decades, engineers in a variety of industries have counted on Keysight for easier access to accurate repeatable measurements at even higher frequencies and wider bandwidths. Today, we are the industry’s leading innovator in the commercialization of tools for millimeter wave simulation, test, and analysis. In October we extended our leadership with an industry leading breakthrough in spectrum and signal analysis at millimeter wave frequencies. Our new signal analyzer is the first to provide continuous frequency coverage from three hertz to 110 gigahertz and spans across access, front haul and back haul 5G applications in an integrated solution. These tools can also be used for satellite communication and automotive radar applications.  Moving to high speed optical networks for data centers, deployment of 100 gig optical technologies throughout the datacenter and efforts to reduce power are driving the need to measure signal quality and integrity. In the fourth quarter, we continued to win deals and see strong demand for our optical and high speed digital test products and growing interest in 400 gig development. Our customers in this market include chip, network equipment, optical transceiver vendors and hyper scale datacenter operators.  At the European Optical Show in September, Keysight showcased new and enhanced solutions to help R&D engineers master their 400 gig designs by making validation easier and speeding up the testing of components and systems.  In the automotive market, the electronic content of cars continues to increase with numerous traditional car manufacturers accelerating their investments in electrified vehicles and autonomous driving. Areas of investment and development include powertrain electrification, battery technology, the connected car, and radar technology. These activities are still in the R&D stage and are expected to be long term growth trends for this market. Keysight recently demonstrated more than 50 automotive design and test solutions across various technology domains including radar, wireless, millimeter wave, high speed digital, and power and energy. We are leveraging our decade’s deep expertise in testing radar technologies for aerospace and defense applications to launch products that address the specific needs for the emerging autonomous driving market. We recently introduced a new radar target simulator to help automotive electronic manufacturers confidently simulate various realistic scenarios. Moving onto our full year performance, the Keysight team executed well on its multiyear strategy to transform and position the company as a solutions leader in key next generation technologies. As a reminder, our ultimate goal is to drive above market growth in the long term and to create value for customers and shareholders.  In Fiscal 2016 we achieved 3% order growth and 2% revenue growth as we navigated a challenging market environment and executed on our strategy. We remain committed to our key growth initiatives and made measurable progress. First, in wireless our focus on positioning Keysight as the market leader in 5G is delivering results. With our technical breadth and expertise in strategic engagement with customers and partners around the globe, Keysight continues to have leading edge solutions for 5G applications available when needed, even as development schedules accelerate. Throughout the year orders for our 5G solutions surpassed expectations resulting in triple digit growth. Second, in modular we achieved double digit order and revenue growth for our PXI and AXI modular business for the year. We introduced several new solutions for a variety of market applications and we received the Frost & Sullivan’s 2016 Growth Excellence Leadership Award in recognition of our strong momentum in PXI based instrumentation. Third, in software, we also delivered double digit order and revenue growth led by our acquisition of Anite and high single digit growth for our market leading design and simulation software solutions. As part of our longer term strategy to expand our software innovation activities, earlier this year we announced a software design center in conjunction with the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta and our staffing plan there is ahead of schedule.  Lastly, in services, while revenue was flat on a reported basis for the year, we generated 9% order growth for the year. Multivendor calibration services showed strong success with aerospace and defense customers. This is a key target market for Keysight and we believe we have gained share.  Overall, we are pleased with our execution Fiscal Year 2016. The strategic actions we have taken are strengthening our market position and creating new business opportunities. Investing in innovation, regardless of short term market challenges is a critical element to our future success as a company.  In Fiscal 2016, we increased our R&D investment by 11% while delivering industry leading non-GAAP operating margin of 19%. We believe our investments are delivering above-market results as we exit the fourth quarter. Our accomplishments speak to the focus, discipline, and commitment of the Keysight team to transform our company for growth and to create value for our customers and shareholders. Moving forward, we will continue to innovate, invest for long term growth and expand our leadership. We are building on the moment we achieved in 2016 with a robust pipeline of new services and solutions that have been identified by our industry teams working closely with leading edge customers. While we expect continued headwinds in some of our markets, we believe we are well positioned to deliver above market results.  Now, I’ll turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q4 financial results as well as our first quarter guides. 
Neil Dougherty : Today we reported fourth quarter revenue of $751 million compared with $756 million in the same period last year. On a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions, revenue decreased 2%. Regionally, core revenue declined 7% in Europe, 1% in the Americas, 11% in Japan, and increased 1% in Asia excluding Japan. In China, we achieved our third consecutive quarter of double digit growth driven by strength in optical and semiconductor process solutions.  Looking at our operational results, gross margin was 57.5%, a year-over-year decrease of 50 basis points due to product mix. For the quarter, operating expenses totaled $290 million, up 2.7% over last year and reflected higher sales cost given our strong order performance in the quarter. This resulted in fourth quarter operating margin of 18.9% compared with 20.7% last year. We reported net income of $110 million or $0.64 per share, which was at the midpoint of our guidance range.  Moving to the performance of our segments; our communications solutions group or CSG includes two primary end markets. First is a commercial communications end market that reported revenue of $254 million, up 3% compared with last year’s fourth quarter driven by growth from 5G and next generation datacenter technologies, offset by continued softness in the broader communications ecosystem.  CGS also includes our aerospace defense and government end markets which generated revenue of $188 million in Q4 compared with $206 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting ongoing weakness in Russia and China. This brought total CSG revenue for the quarter to $442 million, a 2% year-over-year decrease or 4% on a core basis. CSG reported gross margin of 60.3% and operating margin of 17.1%.  Our electronic industrial solutions group, or EISG generated fourth quarter revenue of $201 million, up 1% from last year or down 2% on a core basis driven by ongoing weakness for general electronic solutions, particularly in Europe which was partially offset by strong growth for leading edge semiconductor process technologies and our automotive applications. EISG reported gross margin of 59.6% and operating margin of 23.3%. Lastly, the services solutions group or SSG generated record revenue of $108 million in Q4, a 5% year-over-year increase, or 3% on a core basis. Revenue growth for SSG was driven by an increase in sales for our remarketed solutions. Excluding the impact of three year warranty program revenue for this segment grew 8%. SSG reported gross margin of 42.2% and operating margin at 18.1%.  As Ron highlighted, overall we are pleased with our performance and execution as a company for the 2016 fiscal year. We achieved 3% order growth and 2% revenue growth as we navigated a challenging market environment and remain focused on the growth areas of our market.  Revenue for the year totaled $2.9 billion and gross margin improved 80 basis points to 57.7%. To fuel innovation and strength our market position in strategic areas, we continued to invest in research and development which grew by 11%. At the same time, we remained within our operating model delivering 18.6% operating margin and reporting non-GAAP net income after tax of $419 million or $2.43 per share.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow; we ended our fiscal year 2016 with $783 million in cash and cash equivalents, up $300 million when compared with $483 million at the end of fiscal 2015. We generated $416 million in cash flow from operations for the year, and consistent with our plan, we invested $91 million in capital purchases. This brings our free cash flow for the year to $325 million or 11% of revenue, an improvement of 120 basis points compared to last year.  As we are entering fiscal year 2017, please note a few items for modeling purposes. Annual salary increases are effective December 1, 2016. Additionally, as we mentioned last year cash flow is seasonally lower in Q1 due to the payout of variable compensation. Other operating income is projected to be $15 million in FY17. Interest expense for the year is expected to be $46 million. Pension and benefit expense for the year is projected to increase by approximately $20 million while cash contributions to our global pension plans are expected to be in line with 2016. Lastly, we are committed to continue to opportunistically deploy capital through our share repurchase authorization, but are assuming a base case diluted share count of 175 million shares at year end. We remain committed to investing in the key growth areas of our markets to drive the long term growth of our business while at the same time staying consistent with our operating model. As a reminder, our operating model is structured to deliver high teens operating margins at current revenue levels.  Turning to our outlook and guidance for the first quarter; as Ron noted we are encouraged by the strong order growth we saw in the fourth quarter and while we are seeing increased investment in the development of next generation technologies, we continue to expect headwinds in the broader communications market. Balancing these factors, we currently expect Q1 revenue to be in the range of $706 million to $746 million with the midpoint in line with the first quarter of last year, but on a core basis representing a decline of 1% with the difference entirely due to currency. We expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.63 or $0.56 at the midpoint based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 173 million shares. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard Eastman: Just a couple of questions. Let me just kind of start with the aerospace defense piece of the comm solutions group. Could you kind of just walk through a little bit on the quarter how did the US business do in A&D and any positive vibes here going forward maybe from an order perspective or anything from a front log perspective that suggest that the A&D business can be up low single digits or mid-single digits as we work our way through ’17. 
Ronald Nersesian: I’m going to turn it over to Mike Gasparian. The other question that comes up is whether or not we see any change in aerospace defense spending based on the election results and our take is that aerospace defense spending will increase based on the US election results. I’ll turn it over to Mike who will tell you a little bit more about some of the questions you asked.
Mike Gasparian: Our view on aerospace defense is we still view it as a very stable segment going forward. We clearly have pockets of weakness in Russia and China which Mark Wallace will make some comments on when I’m done, but that’s offset by some really good growth opportunities in some of the other areas.  You asked for some color. In the Americas we have a really nice systems business as well as a great service opportunity with the prime contractors. Both the systems and the services play into the outsourcing trend that I’ve talked about before, so those are good opportunities for the company. Western Europe and India, both have good opportunities for services as well. Then we’ve got radar/satellite segments within those regions that are performing well.  Mark, do you want to maybe add some color about what we’re seeing in China and Russia?
Mark Wallace : In Russia spending declined in Q4 as demand remained soft. During the quarter we saw some delays to some deals and some budgets and it’s really all based on what we’ve seen for a while. It’s the US and European sanctions, low commodity pricing, weak currency, just altogether continue to make the environment challenging. It’s again, important to note that this is not a change from what we saw previously. Then in China, it’s different it’s a weak government spending as we expected as we’re in the early part of China’s five year planning cycle. So, this is kind of normal seasonality as part of that process. 
Richard Eastman: Just a follow up question, the other piece on the comm’s solutions business, I think you highlighted datacenter spend, optical spend, as being higher in the quarter. Even with that the commercial coms business kind of outperformed our expectations. How do you view this business going forward? You commented we’ll still see headwinds here on the more traditional LTE and 4G side, but again, do you start to look at this business as stable with upside potential or stable with maybe still downside exposure? How do you look at this overall collection of products and markets here geographically as well as by product for commercial comms going forward?
Ronald Nersesian: I’ll make a general worldwide comment and then I’ll turn it over to Mike for a little bit more of the detailed color. But, we don’t see any specific catalyst at this point. Budgets, outside of leading edge technologies, remains weak but we do of course see increased spending and focus on leading edge technologies such as 5G. We’ve been focused on that and we’ve brought a lot of new solutions to market and as a matter of fact, we mentioned really leap frogging the competition with our 110 gigahertz spectrum analyzer or signal analyzer.  So, the story remains the same, we see leading edge technologies where money is being spent. We see it being pulled in a little bit on 5G and we’re strong there. But outside of that we see things being weak such as 4G spending. We certainly have seen a roll off in that over the year. 
Mike Gasparian: I’ll just add a little bit to Ron’s response. The whole wireless ecosystem just across the board has kind of a weak characteristic. We’re between 4G and 5G so kind of dealing with the trough right now. It almost doesn’t matter if you look at component suppliers, chipset companies, device makers, operator test labs, all of them are dealing with bringing some equilibrium to their supply chains, consolidation and restructuring and so the net effect of all of that is a very restrained CAPEX environment.  We do see, I would characterize it as some wide variations from company-to-company, but across the board despite these headwinds the leading companies continue to make investments in R&D in these next generation technologies. So, Ron highlighted 5G, all the wireless LAN areas 802.11 ad, ay, ax, 400 gigabyte, those are all big good growth areas for us going forward and I think we’re well positioned to capitalize on all those trends. 
Ronald Nersesian: I’ll add if you take a look at our growth rate versus the competition, you can see that we’ll feel very good about our ability to gain share and our market position is much stronger than it was a year or two ago.
Operator: The next question comes from Brian Yuen with Deutsch Bank.
Brian Yuen: I’m curious to get your view on what you think the most important demand drivers for 2017 would be? I know you have a lot going on with growth autos, 5G module, and cloud so how should we sort of think about all these things coming together to impact topline from a modeling perspective in 2017?
Ronald Nersesian: We believe that we’re very well positioned in some of the high growth environments. In particular, we see more investment in R&D than we see in manufacturing and our strategy for years has been to really focus on R&D where we see higher margins and more stability in the business. The other thing is it really plays to our strength of being a leading edge technology player so as we bring out leading edge technologies that no one else can match, that gives us a real advantage in being able to grow and to gain market share. The biggest thing that we see is 5G. There is no doubt about it that 5G has a very, very broad coverage all up and down throughout the communications ecosystem and it’s been playing very well for us. The other thing that’s a growth initiative that it’s not so much a market issue is services. We have had a focus on services and this past quarter we had very strong order growth and we also, for the year, had 9% order growth for services in our service business. We’ve had many successes that in our multivendor calibration service business. So, overall 5G is one very, very big effort. I’ve already mentioned aerospace defense where with the new administration we anticipate there being a ramp up, although it will be probably slow in the beginning to the aerospace defense business, and then on top of it, our competitiveness not only in 5G, but across our electronic industrial market and our services business.  But, we do remain cautious on the overall market outlook because you can look at the rest of the players in the industry and some of the customers that we serve, how their business are going. But again, we have been focusing on the part that has been growing the most which is the R&D environment for leading edge technologies.
Brian Yuen: Maybe a quick follow up on the product roadmap. You noted the 50 automotive design wins, the 100 gigahertz spectrum analyzer and 5G, so for 2017 do you have any early indications of what products might be rolling out to address those growth areas? Anything you might be working on now or have plans to roll out in 2017.
Ronald Nersesian: We don’t comment on the future roadmap. If there is something that we want to comment on, we would go ahead and put it in a press release such as we announced previously that our breakthrough in high performance digital oscilloscope technology in getting to the 100 gigahertz mark with very, very strong signal integrity and high performance. So, that is one thing that we’ve commented on but other things we won’t comment on.  But, we feel very good about our solutions roadmap and their increased market position. We really see that we have gained share from the competition and from our efforts that are really starting to just take stride. We see over the next couple of years being able to create some moment. 
Operator: The next question comes from Patrick Newton with Stifel Nicolaus. 
Patrick Newton: Given that you’re well positioned to grow above the industry and you seem very confident in share gains, the key question seems to be what are your thoughts on the industry growth potential in FY17 and just given the choppy growth for the industry in general, do you anticipate collectively there will be growth in the industry next year?
Mike Gasparian: As Ron just said, we still remain cautious about the overall market outlook looking forward. Clearly, we’re seeing acceleration in next generation technologies, but there are other portions of the market that continue to remain under pressure. I think the important thing for us is that we have a business and an operating model that enables us to perform and delivery some profitability and cash flow under any market conditions.  We’re going to continue to be cautious, continue to execute on our plan, continue to transform our investments if you will, continue making investments in R&D and in the field to capture future growth. We’re funding those investments through increased efficiencies in our factories through improved gross margins. Our gross margins were up 80 basis points this year and increased efficiency in our administrative functions as well.  ’17, these markets are notoriously difficult to call. We see no specific catalyst at this point and remain cautious as we enter 2017. 
Patrick Newton: I’m just trying to understand the guidance a little bit. You have bookings up almost $30 million year-over-year but the midpoint of the guidance matches revenue from fiscal 1Q last year. I guess after a soft bookings quarter in 3Q is this kind of a backlog refill? Is there any change into maybe the timing of deliveries that’s embedded in the bookings or backlog, or any reason why we wouldn’t see a higher midpoint in the guidance?
Ronald Nersesian: First of all, you’re largely correct, we saw good bookings here in Q4 but had been in a relatively softer backlog position entering the quarter. So, first of all we keep the exact same process going into Q1 as we have used previously. We look at our existing backlog, that backlog is scheduled out from a shipment perspective so we know what portion of our backlog is shippable in Q1. We then look at our order funnel and make some assumptions about how incoming orders are going to convert to revenue within the quarter.  The one other factor, which is a change from this year, in fiscal 2016 Chinese New Year fell at the beginning of Q2 which quite frankly is a little bit better timing from a business perspective than where it falls here in FY17 at the very tail end of our Q1. So, we’ve certainly factored that in to our guidance, although I will say it is another factor that impacts predictability for the quarter. So, we’re highly confident in our ability to fall within our range, but that timing of Chinese New Year, depending on how shipments move, there’s very little time to recover if things happen differently than we’ve modeled them.
Patrick Newton: On modular I think you gave us the data point that you had double digit growth in orders for both the AXL and PXL side of the business. I’m just curious, I think you gave us a data point last year of kind of where your analyzed orders were and any update you can give us currently?
Ronald Nersesian: We’re not giving any new specific guidance or I would say information except that year-over-year we did see double digit order and revenue growth for modular. 
Patrick Newton: Anite is fully integrated. I would just love your thoughts on your appetite for M&A or if you’re more focused now on more organic initiatives?
Ronald Nersesian: We have a blend. There’s no doubt that what we’re doing is we’re focusing on getting our organic growth up like we mentioned at the end of last year and that continues to be a real focus for us. We’re doing that obviously by shifting more of our expense to R&D and to direct feet on the street to sell and we’re very pleased with our progress. But also, we’re looking at market segments that are adjacent that could actually be something where we could create value for our shareholders and increase our overall growth rate.  So, we’re looking at both organic and inorganic but ROIC is clearly one very, very strong measure that use to make sure that we can get a great return on anything we do that’s inorganic.
Operator: The next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. 
Brandon Couillard: I’m just curious in general are you satisfied, are you happy with the returns you’re seeing on the stepped up R&D investment and at this point do you have any appetite to perhaps take that another 100 basis points further?
Ronald Nersesian: We’re very, very pleased with the progress that we’re making and again, as you know, when you invest in R&D sometimes it’s a 24 to 36 month investment before the product even hits the market and then a product ramps from there and has to go through a customer’s buying cycle so you don’t always see it in the quarter or even the fiscal year in the actual result. But, we are very pleased with the path that we’re on and the results that we’re getting in at this point. As far as taking it further, right now we’ll be talking a little bit more about modeling but we are slowly making sure that we can get the right returns on the investments that we have before we’re going ahead and trying to invest even more heavily. 
Neil Dougherty: Let me make a couple of extra comments. We’re very pleased with the results that we’re getting from our R&D and the positioning that we’re having in the leading edge technologies referencing again, 5G and our relative position in 5G relative to where we were in prior generation. So, I think you will continue to see us make investments for growth both in R&D and in the field and as we’ve said previously we look to fund those investments in the current revenue levels through efficiencies elsewhere in the P&L reminding you the business model is set up to deliver high teen s operating margins at current revenue levels.  We’re investing in R&D in the field to drive growth when markets recover and we can get this business growing at a 4% sustained rate, we can deliver our 40% incremental when we get to those growth rates. Right now it’s about transitioning the investments we’re making to be more growth oriented so that when markets recover we’re positioned to capture them. 
Ronald Nersesian: As you look at our year numbers, we delivered 19% operating margin while increasing our R&D spend by going ahead and being more efficient in our manufacturing by increasing our gross margin as well making other tradeoffs in the OPEX lines. 
Brandon Couillard: In the fourth quarter revenues came in at the high end of the range, EPS more towards the midpoint low end, was that just a surprise on the mix in gross margins? Then, did you say $15 million of other operating income in fiscal 17 and what exactly is that tied to? Is that Agilent related?
Neil Dougherty: First all, with regard to kind of revenue in Q4 coming in at the high end of the range and EPS more in the middle, really there were two factors that fully explain that. One was product mix. We’ve been working on kind of a long term trend to increase the proportion of our business that comes from R&D versus manufacturing solutions and that’s still a trend line that we’re comfortably on. But relative to the past couple of quarters, our mix in Q4 of manufacturing based solutions was slightly higher and that drove a lower overall gross margin.  Then the second thing was a direct result of the higher order levels. Obviously, our commissions climb with the higher order levels and that obviously will yield a benefit in coming quarters.  The second part of the question was with regard to other income and yes, that is a direct relation to the kind of the landlord tenant relationship that exists with Agilent where we essentially own facilities and are leasing space back to our prior parent. 
Operator: That concludes our question and answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary. 
Jason Kary : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at the upcoming investor conferences that I mentioned at the top of the call and appreciate you joining us today. Have a great day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

We hope to see many of you there. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ron.
Ron Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. We will focus today's discussion on three important headlines. First, we delivered strong third quarter results, which included growing revenue 8%, and achieving 20% operating margin and 15% earnings growth. Second, even though we continue to see headwinds in some markets, customers are accelerating investment in next-generation technologies. And third, we have made solid progress on our strategy to transform Keysight for growth. Given our targeted investments, including the acquisition of Anite, and the company focus on customer solutions, we believe we are capturing share in key next-gen markets. While it is still early, the strides we are making in the market today position us well for growth in the long-term. Now let's start with an overview of Keysight's third quarter performance. We are pleased with our strong financial results and execution in the quarter. Revenue of $718 million grew 8% over last year while earnings per share of $0.63 increased 15%. As we expected, the communications market remains soft. Additionally, macro uncertainty in Europe, which was further compounded by Brexit, impacted third quarter orders primarily in our aerospace, defense and government and electronic industrial end markets. We estimate that Europe was an approximate 3% headwind to our order growth for the quarter. Outside of Europe, we delivered order growth across all regions. Even with these broader market dynamics, we are seeing customers increase investment in next-generation technologies such as 5G, optical networks for datacenters, leading-edge semiconductor processes, and high-performance wireless-LAN chipsets. The mega-trend driving development of all of these technologies is the increasing reliance on electronic and digital communications and the growing number of connected devices from watches to cars. First, let's take a look at 5G. It is clear that timelines and investments in 5G are accelerating. Carriers plan to launch 5G trials as earlier as 2017 with early deployment of 5G technologies in 2018. In order to help foster the development of 5G wireless networks in the U.S., the FCC has opened up nearly 11 gigahertz of higher-frequency spectrum. Additionally, the U.S. government has launched a $400 million initiative for advanced wireless research. The National Science Foundation will lead this new initiative and will use Keysight's solutions and services to test next-generation cellular and wireless LAN technologies. As we have discussed before, our strategy to be first in 5G includes developing leading-edge technologies and solutions and engaging early with key partners. We are making solid progress on this initiative and 5G orders continue to outpace our expectations. Driving this growth is demand for our millimeter wave solutions, including over-the-air, channel sounding and massive MIMO solutions. In addition to our industry-leading 5G solutions, our early engagements with 5G innovators are contributing to our success. With over 25 collaborations to-date, we added two new strategic partnerships this quarter: Datang from China and The National Applied Research laboratories in Taiwan. Demonstrating our continued innovation in 5G and software solutions, we recently introduced the industry's first all-in-one signal optimizer software for designing 5G candidate waveforms. This solution enables R&D engineers to confidently validate their designs by simplifying the critical design tasks related to signal creation and analysis. Keysight is committed to advancing global 5G innovation. We have a strong new product roadmap that will enable us to gain share as the migration to 5G evolves. Moving to high-speed optical networks for datacenters, the upgrade to 100 gigabit is just beginning and efforts to increase data speeds and reduce power are driving the need to measure signal quality and integrity. In the third quarter we secured several large deals with leaders throughout this supply chain, including chip, network equipment, and optical transceiver vendors. We are also seeing an increase in 400 gigabit activity. Our recently introduced modular solution for 400 gigabit addresses critical R&D and testing requirements and integrates both PAM-4 and NRZ signals on one testing platform. This unique level of integration and scalability will enable engineers to master the receiver test and design challenges for 400 gigabit datacenter interconnects. In the semiconductor industry, the major foundries are in a race to shrink form factors and build faster, more energy-efficient components. This is driving increased investment in future semiconductor process technology and timelines have accelerated. As a result, we delivered strong double-digit order and revenue growth for our parametric test solutions in the third quarter. These next-generation technologies represent long-term opportunities for Keysight and are important to achieving our growth objectives. The strategic actions we have taken are strengthening our market position and creating new business opportunities. This included the acquisition of Anite that we completed one year ago. Anite significantly enhanced our wireless protocol capabilities and software portfolio, which are critical technologies as the industry migrates to 5G. Anite has achieved two consecutive quarters of double-digit order growth, despite headwinds in the communications market. Additionally, the acquisition has been accretive to both gross margin and earnings as we are executing seamlessly on the integration and are on-track to deliver the committed synergies. Moving forward, we will continue to execute our strategy to transform our business for long-term growth with the objective of creating added value for both customers and shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q3 financial results, as well as our fourth quarter guidance.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today we reported third quarter revenue of $718 million, up 8% year-over-year, or up 2% on a core basis. Regionally, core revenue declined 8% in Europe and grew 3% in the Americas, 1% in Japan and 6% in Asia excluding Japan. The regional mix of total revenue was 37% in the Americas, 17% from Europe, and 46% from Asia. China, which represents 20% of our overall business, grew at a low double-digit rate in the third quarter. Our third quarter operational results were strong with gross margin increasing to 58.7%, a year-over-year improvement of 210 basis points. Our improving gross margin continued to reflect a higher percentage of revenue from software and R&D solutions. Additionally, we realized a 70 basis point benefit from an adjustment to our warranty reserve liability as we have had lower than expected warranty claims. For the quarter operating expenses totaled $281 million, up 11% over last year primarily due to the addition of Anite. This resulted in third quarter operating margin of 19.5%, a year-over-year increase of 90 basis points. Net income increased 15% to $108 million or $0.63 per share, which was at the high-end of our guidance range. Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, includes two primary end-markets. First is the commercial communications end market, which includes the mobile device and infrastructure supply chain, wireless network operators and datacenter and optical equipment manufacturers. Commercial communications revenue was $252 million in the third quarter, up 14% including revenue from Anite. As Ron mentioned, the market headwinds in the wireless supply chain that we highlighted earlier this year continued to offset the strong growth from 5G and next-generation datacenter technologies. CSG also includes our aerospace, defense and government end markets, which generated revenue of $172 million in Q3, up 3% over the same quarter last year. Growth in this end market was driven by steady spending in the U.S., partially offset by softness in Europe and Asia. This brought total CSG revenue for the quarter to $424 million, which is up 9% year-over-year or flat on a core basis. CSG reported gross margin of 61.7%. Expenses increased year-over-year with the acquisition of Anite, bringing operating margin to 18.1%, compared with 18.4% in the third quarter of last year. Moving to our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, this group provides design and measurement solutions across a broad set of electronic industrial end markets including automotive, energy, consumer electronics, education, and semiconductor. EISG generated third quarter revenue of $191 million, up 9% over last year or 7% on a core basis. The growth in EISG was driven by strong sales for our parametric semiconductor measurement solutions, partially offset by weakness in Europe. With the strong top-line performance, EISG gross margin improved 340 basis points to 60.7% and operating margin improved 460 basis points to 23.1%. Lastly, in our third segment, the Services Solutions Group, or SSG, we generated revenue of $103 million in Q3, a 2% year-over-year increase or flat on a core basis. Excluding the impact of the three-year warranty program, revenue for this segment grew 6%. Growth was driven by our multi-vendor calibration services and a rebound in used equipment sales. SSG reported operating margin of 18.7%, up 750 basis points over the prior quarter. The significant sequential improvement in operating margin was largely driven by the higher top-line. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $664 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the quarter we generated $68 million in cash flow from operations, reflecting our typical seasonality as well as higher working capital balances driven largely by timing factors within the quarter. Capital purchases totaled $14 million, bringing our free cash flow to $54 million, or 8% of revenue. We do expect Q4 cash flow to improve in line with our historical seasonality. In the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 707,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $28.20 per share for a total consideration of $20 million. This brings our total shares repurchased to-date to approximately 2.3 million for a total consideration of $62 million, or 31% of our $200 million authorization. We will continue to opportunistically deploy capital under this repurchase program, even as we work to identify M&A opportunities that will help us achieve our growth objectives. Overall, we are very pleased with our operational performance and execution as a company. Our operating model has the ability to deliver strong profitability under a variety of end-market conditions, which sets us apart from others in our industry. We remain committed to executing our strategy to transform Keysight for long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the fourth quarter. As Ron noted, while we are seeing increased investment in the development of next-generation technologies, we continue to see headwinds in the broader communications market. Additionally, orders in the third quarter were impacted by macro uncertainty in Europe and we are incorporating this into our market outlook. We currently expect Q4 revenue to be in the range of $715 million to $755 million, which at the mid-point reflects a year-over-year decline of 3%, or 4% on a core basis. Note that as we have now passed the one-year anniversary of the Anite acquisition, the difference between total and core revenue growth in the fourth quarter will be entirely due to currency. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.71, or $0.64 at the mid-point, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares. At the mid-point, this would bring our non-GAAP earnings per share for FY 2016 to $2.43 on revenue of $2.9 billion. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Christine, could you give the instructions for the Q&A, please.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.
Sachin Kulkarni: Hi good afternoon, it's Sachin in for Brandon. Ron, what are the operational implications if any of a new segment, any sales force realignment involved or changes in terms of internal resource allocations or just simply a manifestation of the leadership realignment you made last fall. Any thought process on the groupings?
Ron Nersesian: Sure. The main difference is that we have aligned all of the efforts that we have in the groups to be focused on customers. So we have one group that will work with key customers, for instance, communication customer and find out what type of solutions they need. Now it may be a standard solution that we already have, such as a spectrum analyzer or network analyzer, but they also may need something different like a special channel sounding solution, which we didn't have approximately a year ago. And this group is tasked and has all the technology and all the people to bring any type of solution to bear. The field organization is aligned to go after specific customers, and they're doing that very, very well.
Sachin Kulkarni: Got it. And in terms of like the 5G demand that you're seeing so far, could you say how it translates towards modular products versus the other products and portfolio?
Mike Gasparian: Yes. This is Mike Gasparian. Let me give you a couple of comments about 5G. I'm really pleased with our position in 5G. The headlines would be we're seeing really strong growth. We've got a good solution set now and we're really well-positioned for the long-term. From a growth standpoint, our orders have more than doubled over where they were last year at this time. The timelines and the investments are accelerating in the R&D space. There's a lot of catalysts in the market that are causing that acceleration, and I think Ron covered those in his comments. We've a good set of solutions now. There's a lot of millimeter wave solutions that are needed for trials and deployment. And just in general, we're seeing that the 28-gigahertz frequency being a primary area where trials are being done. This is going to require major retooling at all of our customers and there's a lot of new challenges associated with millimeter wave. Channel sounding reference solutions. There is a big challenge in over-the-air testing, massive MIMO applications. Even the new signal optimizer or software that Ron talked about, that's all about people evaluating, calibrating 5G candidate waveforms. So kind of the bottom-line out of whole thing is we're extremely well-positioned for the long-term, we've got good focus on R&D. The fact that we’ve got Anite in our portfolio allows us to deliver much more complete solutions. And then, in regards to Modular, just I'll add a couple of comments in there. Our momentum really continues in Modular. It's important to remember, we've got a good combination of both PXI and AXIe components. I think we're outperforming the markets we're up double-digits again this last quarter, and we're building out our portfolio. So in the past we've done things like that. The PXI vector network analyzer continues to exceed expectations, but a lot of new products this quarter we introduced high-performance [BERT rate][ph] tester that's really going after 400-gigabit research applications in data center interconnects. Lots of other parts of our portfolio get impacted by things like the new PXI 18 slot, third-generation chassis that has super high bandwidth and that plays really into anything that's got multi-channel applications. So that's just that's not only 5G, but it gets us into variety of other aerospace and defense applications. So let me stop there and see if that covered your topic.
Sachin Kulkarni: Yes, it did, thank you. And for Ron, I'm sorry, for Neil, would you remind us what the incremental cost savings were for what we should expect in FY 2017 from recent restructuring actions? I think, it was around $25 million to $30 million and most of it should be in year two, which is next year.
Neil Dougherty: Yes. We've talked about a $25 million cost reduction program that was announced at the end of Q2 last year, and we said that was a two-year program, and we are materially it's not totally complete, but we are well on our way to having fully realized that $25 million worth of savings. And then, there was another $20 million of cost-related synergies that come out from Anite and it was those synergies that are pretty heavily backend loaded. So we're very much on track with Anite to deliver those synergies. We've given some of the work that had to be done that was going to be backend loaded, so that was $20 million run rate at the two-year anniversary of the Anite acquisition.
Sachin Kulkarni: Got it thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Both are on track.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Newton: Hi Ron and Neil, thank you very much for taking my questions. I guess, just given the solid Anite orders that you talked about and progress towards achieving synergies with that acquisition I would love to hear what your appetite is for M&A currently and how your pipeline looks?
Ron Nersesian: Well, we cannot make any specific comments with regards to M&A. The one big question that was asked before was Keysight is a good operator as you've seen what we've done in Agilent and the question was can we also do that effectively with M&A on inorganic activities. And I think we've shown that we can integrate companies very, very effectively. We can retain the key management people, and we could generate orders and accretion. Of course, we would not do an acquisition if we couldn't get to at least 15% return on invested capital. So I think this is another proof point besides some of the smaller proof points that we don't talk about that shows that we can be very effective at creating value through organic or inorganic activities.
Patrick Newton: Great. Okay. And I guess Ron could you elaborate on the communication softness that you're seeing may be discuss where weakness is most pervasive or least pervasive I guess across infrastructure, handset, R&D components or any way you like to break down that market?
Mike Gasparian: Yes, Ron this is Mike Gasparian. I will take that. No, overall the communications ecosystem is soft. If we look at it from a manufacturing capacity standpoint, I think there is plenty of capacity there for devices, the same thing is true, lot of digestion that had to happen in the supply chain, and then certainly, we virtually every week, every month you see more consolidation in restructuring particularly in the chipset area. So those are the factors that are kind of keeping it on the soft side. On the really on more of a positive note, I've seen a very disciplined capital allocation model coming from most companies where a lot -- a lower emphasis is being put, you might call it muted investment in 4G and LTE and more emphasis and increased investment in 5G as well as high-performance wireless LAN technologies, the backend of the ecosystem is very strong and healthy data centers, optical network connections, other things just R&D is strong across the board, good strength in China, and we've got great partnerships with key players all around the world throughout the entire ecosystem and that's leading to a lot of very strategic design wins for us.
Patrick Newton: Great Mike. Thanks for the details.
Neil Dougherty: I would just add that if you look at where we are now versus where we were at this time in the 4G cycle, we are much better positioned than we were before, we are much more focused at working to bring the right solutions to market, we're confident in our progress and our operating model is intact, I mean had to turn that into cash.
Patrick Newton: Great. And then I guess for Mike or Ron, you spend a significant amount of time talking about 5G calling the timing for deployments and how orders continue to pace ahead of expectations. I think you gave us little future that 5G orders doubled year-over-year. What I'm trying to figure out is the relative sizes of the 5G market, can you give us any type of teaser as to when you think 5G could be 10% of revenue or the relative size of 5G within your order book now to just for us to gauge the impact from this to the P&L?
Mike Gasparian: Hey, Patrick, so this is Mike again. We're really still in the early days, this is pre-standard phase of 5G most of the engagements are very strategic working with customers, trying to understand their most challenging problems associated with, that's the new millimeter wave frequency. So it's going to be, we really thought 5G was going to hit mainstream in 2019, 2020. We definitely seen that accelerate. I think it could start to become more significant for us in may be 2018. But between now and then it's more about strategic wins and alignment with key customers so you're viewed as a solution provider of choice.
Patrick Newton: Great. And then Neil just a gross margin question it seemed that guidance is implicit with the step-down sequentially. I've seen some of that is due to the reversal of the warranty benefit that we just saw this quarter. Just want to make sure I'm reading the tea leaves right there and if so what is embedded into that expectation for the decline?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so the -- on the one end you are correct, the warranty doesn't reverse but it was a one-time entry to adjust the overall size of our warranty accrual which is now lower because of our improving quality of our instruments. So just generally speaking our warranty costs are less than expected and so you will see a benefit going forward but there was a one-time benefit in Q3 to adjust the size of the warranty liability. Going forward, as we look forward to next quarter, so the sequential, the sequential deterioration is really due to that. We believe our gross margin performance continues to be very strong. We continue to see a larger and larger portion of our revenue come from R&D solutions and from software solutions which tend to have higher gross margin so we're very pleased with the trajectory of gross margins within the business.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Charles Long: Hi, this is Charles calling in for Toshiya. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. One, can you kind of talk about how core comps trended ex-Anite in the quarter. And then two or I guess take part of that one can you give us a little feel for what kind of drove the acceleration in semiconductor spending and the sustainability of that spend?
Ron Nersesian: The core communications excuse me the core communications orders were flat for the quarter and I'll let Mike talk a little bit about the trends.
Neil Dougherty: Just the revenue was flat within communications for the quarter not orders.
Mike Gasparian: So I think we covered a lot of the trends. We've talked about the overall market remaining soft. I kind of highlighted a few areas of supply chain issues consolidation, restructuring. I think the big strength we're seeing is in the R&D phase. It's all about new technologies, very selective investments by customers in various 5G technologies, high-performance wireless LAN technologies, data center technologies, optical technologies. So those are the areas where we're seeing strength, there is big investment in the China chipset companies and we've got partnerships with a lot of those companies that that end up playing into the communications ecosystem as well.
Neil Dougherty: You asked the second part of your question was about semiconductor and I think we're really seeing strength in a couple of areas there. So first of all there is a broad effort within China to go after the semiconductor market spaces, big investments that are happening in China that are driving strength in our Parametric Test business and across some of our other solutions gone to semiconductor as well. And then just generally speaking across the boundaries, there is a migration to smaller and smaller chip architectures and as they migrate to those chip architectures they can drive demand for our products as well.
Charles Long: Got it, thank you. And then I guess just one more can you give us as a rough reminder of what the kind of split is between R&D software and manufacturing revenue? Thanks.
Neil Dougherty: Well we've sized our software business about a year ago, it was north of $300 million prior to the acquisition of Anite and Anite added about an additional $100 million to our software business, so that gives you an idea of the proportion of our business is coming from software. The only thing we've said publicly about the proportion of our manufacturing versus R&D business is that we have kind of jumped it, the threshold where R&D is now the larger portion of our business greater than 50%. And we did that little over a year ago as well and continued to make progress in that area so that it doesn't move terribly quickly but we continue to migrate more and more towards software solutions. So I would also note that the Anite business which we acquired a year ago this week actually was almost exclusively sold into R&D type application so that helped to drive that balance as well.
Ron Nersesian: And Charles, our overall strategy is, is really played out in the numbers Neil was just talking about. Our overall strategy is to move from hardware centric products to software centric solutions. So in doing that we are seeing the percentage of our software business we'll be driving that up further and further. Second we'll be moving to more solutions which includes not only software but includes a lot of services from John Page's groups. But on top of that we are migrating and migrating as quickly as we can from manufacturing to R&D and that's something that we stated back as early as 2013 and we've made great progress on that where R&D is our number one market as Neil pointed out.
Charles Long: Got it and if I could actually just flip one more in, just kind of wondering what kind of traction you've had with some of the cross-sell opportunities in terms of getting Anite into the aerospace and defense space and how that's trending? Thanks.
Guy Séné: This is Guy. Definitely we have had one of our successes with Anite is the leverage of the sales channel that we have in Keysight and driving some of their key products into older customer sets. Aerospace defense is one but it's more generic than this. And I came with nice portfolio of solutions one is the channel emulation solution where they are leading in fact and we've been able to start proposing this to a number of customers as we go and clearly has helped but more work is happening and I'm really bullish for this type of technology going forward.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Brian Modoff: Hi this is Brian on for Vijay. Thanks for taking the question. Could you may be give us some visibility into the business in the back half of 2016 and into 2017. I think you touched on the Communications side, but on the government end market, are you seeing any new large deals or follow-ons in the back half? And then my second question is more about housekeeping one, but how should we think about OpEx over the next few quarters from a modelling perspective?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So let me address some of those questions. So first of all, with regard to kind of the back half of 2016 calendar year 2016 and beyond, obviously, we will only provide guidance one quarter out and so you can see what we provided there. If you take a look at the midpoint of our guidance that implies of about a 3% decline in our total business for the year, which we actually think is better than what the total markets achieved. We think the total market this year was down mid-single-digits. As we look forward, we talked about the softness we're seeing in the Communications, and what we're seeing in Europe. With regard to aerospace/defense, we're relatively -- we expect to see normal kind of cyclicality with regard to the aerospace/defense business in the U.S., which tends to peak around government fiscal year ended September. We have seen some softness in our offshore aerospace/defense clients. I think, over the longer-term, I'd point back to the next generation technologies where we're seeing continued and rapid growth we believe we're well-positioned to win in those markets, and those are the markets that are going to drive overall growth in the business when the broader market recovers. So we believe, we are well-positioned, and we have an operating model that enables us to deliver strong profitability in a variety of economic conditions as evidenced by the 20% operating margins that we developed this quarter.
Brian Modoff: Okay. Great. And just about OpEx over next few quarters?
Neil Dougherty: Yes I think our OpEx trends are more or less are in line. We basically have been maintaining our R&D investment on a dollars basis. You can see as our top-line has been moving around our R&D investments have been pretty stable, and that's intent with us maintaining our investments for the future and basically not overreacting to short-term perturbations in our market, but making sure that we're making the investments that we need to make to drive growth in the future. And similarly on the SG&A lines, I think, you shouldn't expect any material change there.
Operator: We have time for one last question. And the question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Yes thank you for sneaking me in here. Ron, I think you talked at the beginning here about orders late in the quarter in Europe kind of Brexit pushback. I think the math may be suggest you were about $20 million short. I think you said it was a 2% headwind. If you -- if that's the right math and you throw the $20 million in there, it looks like may be orders were pretty seasonal. Has -- with that exception in Europe is that about how you feel about or how the business looks at the present time that it's kind of returned to more seasonal norms in terms of demand?
Ron Nersesian: Hi Richard, you're very astute. That's exactly what we saw. If you look at our forecast, and we do a monthly forecast, actually we do a roll up every couple of weeks. But if you take a look at the forecast month by month for the sales organization, we were on the first month of the quarter on the second month of the quarter and off by $20 million in July. So that really adds up to what we're seeing. It's not all Brexit; we see Russia and Russia being weak in aerospace/defense and a general malaise in Europe. And as I did point out earlier, every region grew in orders with the exception of Europe. So we feel very good about our business and our competitive position, but we do deal with the economic situations that do exists around the world, but this will not stop us from investing and making sure that we're leading for the next wave of 5G. I'm going to ask Guy to see if he wants to make any other questions -- make any other comments about Europe.
Guy Séné: Well, on Europe, I think most of the summary clearly, it has, we've seen the impact in July when this came after the announcement of Brexit, but also Russia was weaker. Across the board and rest of the world, we must say that we grew orders in all the other regions and clearly America was stable or with steady aerospace/defense from prime contractors on major programs that we're winning, so America is stable. Japan was steady with broad industries good successes. And then, Asia was strong. We had a very solid growth of our business in China, for instance, on the semiconductor solutions that Neil mentioned earlier, but also optical and 5G. So that's a broader perspective for what's happened. And I believe we're well-positioned in the market with our solutions, especially for our next-generation technologies.
Richard Eastman: Ron, when you and again, I realized that you guys give one quarter guidance, but into the fourth quarter here at this point, Ron, what sort of prospects here that your hand electronic test market outlook, for the next 12 to 15 months, do we -- does the market kind of pop back in the positive territory. I mean, we've had the downdraft on the non-5G, e-com side, maybe there is a new wrinkle here in Europe now with Brexit, I don't know what the tail is on that, but it's been sometime since the industry has seen a positive growth rate certainly in the range of 2% to 3%. But is there a pretty good portability here that the industry could actually see this long-term growth rate of 2% to 3% through 2017?
Ron Nersesian: No, we don't comment on markets further up, but I just will make a couple of qualitative comments. Obviously, you remember everything in 2009 and then we saw a big bounce back of over 20% growth in 2010 and 2011, and we're not in that situation at all. We do see at times in R&D where there is a pent-up demand where business is soft and people are holding off on their capital equipment and capital equipment can pop back a bit, but we do not forecast that further out. But as you know, our markets are cyclical, and we have seen them come back at times. I do think on the manufacturing side that the actual cost per test has reduced as we've all talked about for manufacturing Smartphones. We saw that in 2012. We actually walked away from a major supplier at that point and it turned out to be a pretty smart move that was a very profitable deal for us. And I think in the future, it would have been slightly different. But as far as when the market will bounce back, we do not predict that. Neil, are there any other comments that you'd like to add?
Neil Dougherty: Yes. I would just point you back to some of the numbers that we put out there right we think the market in 2016 is down mid-single-digits. We don't -- we're not going to call an uptick until we see it. That being said, as we look forward we see the softness in comps, the softness in Europe, we're incorporating that into our market outlook, but it's hard to know when things are going to turn around. We built the business model that is designed to deliver strong profitability whether we recognize in our markets kind of move in plus to minus 10% band and you see that in the profitability that we're generating today and looking over the long-term, we do see pockets of the market focused around next-generation technologies that are growing very well. 5G, the new semiconductor process is 100-gigabit looking forward to 400-gigabit. And we really like the way we're positioned in those next-generation technologies, so when markets recover again, we'd like to hand that we have and we like where we are positioned.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just last question, I apologize. Neil, within the EISG segment, the gross margin step up to the 60.7%, could you just purse that out a bit, does the warranty adjustment fall in there, and then also is that also reflective of the software mix or is it a parametric test business nicely profitable? What's going on in the 340 bps?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so the warranty benefit was spread across the other businesses, all businesses and no one business did proportionately benefited from that. I think you're seeing basically the favorable mix of products that were sold in that business -- on a business that had a pretty strong revenue performance for the quarter as well.
Richard Eastman: Okay, okay very good. Thank you again.
Neil Dougherty: Historical financials for that business, which you are available on the website, you'll see there is some volatility around profits, but there have been several quarters over the past couple of years where the profits have ticked up to this kind of level, driven by top-line, driven by mix.
Ron Nersesian: But Richard, I'd just like to make one last comment. You can see our operating margin up 20% at this revenue level, and I think we have done a pretty decent job of managing to a solid operating model. And if the revenue goes up, our incremental look pretty doing good, and as we've commented that they're 40% when our growth rate is above 40%.
Richard Eastman: 4%. Okay.
Ron Nersesian: 4%.
Operator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary.

Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, Jason. And thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered strong second quarter earnings as we continue to navigate a challenging market and execute on our initiatives to transform our business. We will focus today's discussion on three important headlines. First, our second quarter financial results were strong, with earnings and revenue at the high end of our guidance. Second, we continued to make progress on our growth initiatives, and we are pleased with the momentum we are gaining in these areas. And third, consistent with our strategy to opportunistically return capital, we repurchased $42 million in common stock under the $200 million repurchase authorization we announced in February. This action is reflective of the confidence we have in our ability to achieve above market growth in the long-term. Now let's get started with an overview of Keysight's second quarter performance. In Q2 we delivered $0.61 in earnings per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue for the quarter was $735 million, representing a decline of 1%. On a core basis, which excludes revenue from acquisitions and the impact of currency, revenue declined 7%, primarily driven from the slowdown in wireless communications. As we expected, the market and spending environment continued to be soft; however, we are pleased with the execution in the quarter. We delivered revenue and EPS at the top end of our guidance range and achieved order growth on a core basis. We continue to make measurable progress on our strategic initiatives to transform our business and position the company for growth. Our momentum in these areas continued to build. First, in wireless we continue to expand our leadership in 5G. While off a small base, orders for our 5G solutions continued to accelerate, and more than doubled over last year. Growth was primarily driven by investment in millimeter wave development and modeling software. This past quarter 5G development was the headline at Mobile World Congress. At the event in February we demonstrated unique capabilities, such as our 5G channel sounding solution, which engineers used to evaluate how effectively a signal will travel between a base station and a cell phone in a real-world environment. We also showcased the system for massive MIMO 5G beam-forming calibration, as well as new design and test tools for 802.11 ad. We also recently announced that we have joined China Mobile's newly formed 5G innovation center. Strategic relationships such as these are critical to our 5G leadership. We first engaged with China Mobile on their 5G research starting back in 2014. In this new collaboration, we are working with China Mobile and other industry partners to promote 5G innovation and to provide new 5G design and test solutions and support for the whole 5G ecosystem. This also includes solutions for channel measurement and modeling and massive MIMO Over-the-Air Testing. We are actively involved with leading standards bodies and industry leaders in Asia, Europe and the US as they begin the first phases of 5G standards development. 5G research is starting to move into early development, with major carriers announcing trials ahead of standards being adopted. The use of spectrum well above 6 gigahertz is one of several areas of investigation under the 5G umbrella. As frequencies move higher, the engineering challenge is become increasingly complex, while 5G research at these frequencies is emerging, higher frequencies has in fact been supported by Keysight's commercial and aerospace, defense solutions for decades. In addition to higher carrier frequencies, the higher data rates associated with 5G require wider frequency bands around the carriers, and these in turn require test equipment with wider analysis bandwidths. To meet these needs, in February Keysight introduced the industry's first 50-gigahertz signal analyzer integrated with 1 gigahertz of analysis bandwidth. Moving onto our modular initiative, or PXI and AXIe modular solutions again delivered solid double-digit order and revenue growth, with particular strength in aerospace, defense and optical applications for 100-gigabit manufacturing. Additionally we are seeing momentum in wireless LAN, as our router and network access customers are performing more rigorous testing on their high-performance wireless LAN chipsets. We have a strong position in this market, and we further advanced our footprint in the second quarter by winning new modular solutions business with a leading network equipment vendor. Moving onto our software growth initiative, we realized strong year-over-year revenue growth driven by Anite and our market-leading design and simulation solutions. Our integration of Anite remains on track, as we are beginning to realize top-line synergies by leveraging the Keysight sales channel. As an example, we won a multimillion dollar Anite solutions deal with a leading Keysight customer in the US. Additionally, we are building momentum with our recently launched Anite Virtual Drive Testing Solution that verifies mobile device performance in high-speed train scenarios. As we have discussed previously, software solutions play an important role in our strategy to transform our business. We are committed to investing in this area and broadening our software portfolio. To accelerate these efforts and foster innovation, I'm excited to announce that we are creating a new software development center with the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. Georgia Tech is one of the best and largest engineering programs in the country. Its graduates bring with them skills and capabilities that will be a great asset to Keysight in developing next-generation technologies and solutions. And lastly, looking at our services initiative, we delivered solid double-digit order growth in the second quarter. This was driven by ongoing success with our multi-vendor calibration services, new business in Europe and the US, along with follow-on deals with several large aerospace, defense customers. Our calibration and service capabilities can be an important factor in winning new design and test solutions business, especially as customers look for ways to assure system uptime. Our services solutions group and our sales team recently joined forces to win a multimillion dollar competitive modular opportunity. This customer needed a modular solution that delivered superior performance and on-site services for uptime assurance in their high volume manufacturing environment. Moving onto our markets. In line with our expectations as we discussed in February, macro factors continue to impact market growth. The most notable pullback continued to be in the communications area where wireless supply chain customers in North America and Asia paused spending due to lower components and smartphone shipments. Outside of communications, we delivered solid mid single digit core order growth with strength in aerospace, defense and industrial markets. While the communications market outlook remains soft, our performance across other end markets was steady, and we are very pleased with the execution and leadership amidst this challenging backdrop. Additionally, with our continued commitment to operational excellence and to maintain strong profitability through the cycle, we delivered 18.3% operating margin in the quarter and generated $89 million in free cash flow. Consistent with our strategy to opportunistically deploy capital, we repurchased $42 million in stock. This action reflects the confidence we have in our ability to achieve above market growth when the market stabilize and customers across our markets re-accelerate capital investments. Our continued progress on our growth initiative demonstrates that we are investing in the right areas and are creating value for our customers and partners by bringing leading-edge solutions and services to market. Now I will turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q2 financial results, as well as our third quarter guidance.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron. And hello, everyone. Today we reported second quarter non-GAAP revenue of $735 million, at the top end of our guidance range of $695 million to $735 million. On a year-over-year basis this represents an approximate 1% decline, or 7% decline on a core basis. Looking at our top-line performance by end market, communications revenue was $252 million and grew 2% year-over-year, including revenue from Anite. Excluding Anite, communications revenue decreased, as the market dynamics we highlighted last quarter continued, which included softness in the smartphone supply chain and restructuring and consolidation among some of our largest customers. These headwinds offset growth from 5G technologies, as well as strength in data center business that was driven by optical 100-gigabit manufacturing. Revenue from aerospace, defense was $160 million, up approximately 3% from last year's second quarter. Growth in Asia and steady US spending from our aerospace, defense solutions contributed to the uplift in revenue. Second-quarter industrial, computer and semiconductor revenue was $323 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year reflecting the challenging spending environment. Regionally and on a core basis, revenue declined 14% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 10% in Japan. Revenue in Asia excluding Japan was flat compared with last year. The regional mix of total revenue was 35% from the Americas, 19% from Europe and 46% from Asia. Our second quarter operational results were strong, with gross margins increasing to 57.8%, a 70 basis point improvement year-over-year, largely a result of higher percentage of revenue from software and R&D solutions. Expenses were well managed while we continued to invest in R&D programs in support of our growth initiatives, and on a dollar basis, R&D expenses were in line with Q1. Operating expenses totaled $290 million for the quarter, up 8% over last year, primarily due to the addition of Anite. This resulted in a second quarter operating margin of 18.3% compared with 20.9% in the prior year. On a sequential basis, operating margin improved 50 basis points as we continue to proactively manage our cost structure. Non-GAAP net income after taxes was $106 million, or $0.61 per share, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Moving to the results of our two operating segments. Measurement Solutions generated second quarter revenue of $639 million, in line with last year including revenue from Anite. Gross margin improved 130 basis points to reach 60.6% as a result of increased revenue from software and R&D solutions. Expenses increased year-over-year with the acquisition of Anite, bringing our operating margin for Measurement Solutions to 19.5% compared with 21.3% in the second quarter of last year. The Customer Support and Services Segment generated revenue of $96 million in Q2, a 5% year-over-year decrease, or 6% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of the three year warranty program, revenue for this segment grew 1%. We reported an operating margin of 11.2% for our CSS segment. As a reminder, the services business has a higher fixed cost structure when compared to our Measurement Solutions business, and we have been making investments in additional capacity to expand our multi-vendor calibration and asset management services. We are confident these investments will help support our growth, and the profitability of the Services Segment over the cycle will be consistent with the overall business. Move into the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $620 million in cash and cash equivalents. In the quarter we generated $117 million in cash flow from operations. Capital purchases this quarter totaled $28 million, brining our free cash flow to $89 million, or 12% of revenue. Under the $200 million share repurchase authorization that we announced in February, we repurchased $42 million of our common stock, or 20% of the authorization. We repurchased 1.58 million shares in the open market at an average weighted cost of $26.27 per share. We will continue to opportunistically deploy capital under this repurchase program, as well as look to identify M&A opportunities that will help us achieve our growth objectives. Stepping back from the details of the quarter, we are pleased with our operational discipline as a company and with the ability of our operating model to deliver strong profitability under a variety of end market conditions. We continue to optimize all aspects of our business model, including pricing, sale strategies, cost management and efficiency gains. For example, the costs associated with the software development center in Georgia will be managed within our existing cost envelope as we make trade-offs in other areas. In addition to our operational discipline, we remain focused on executing our strategy which includes continued investment in our growth initiatives, targeted M&A, and market expansion opportunities to ensure increasing value creation both in the short and long-term. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the third quarter. While we are seeing stabilization in some areas of our end markets, the communications market remains quite weak and macro indicators remain uncertain. In light of these market conditions and the traditional seasonality in our business, we remain cautious in our outlook for the third quarter. We expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $697 million to $737 million, which at the mid-point reflects 8% growth year-over-year, or 2% on a core basis. In the third quarter we expect to deliver operating profit in the high teens, while continuing to invest in the growth areas of our business. Balancing these factors, we expect third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be the range of $0.50 to $0.64 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 172 million shares. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks, good afternoon. Ron, would be curious to get your thoughts, your granularity thoughts on just where you saw greater strength in the business and would be curious if you could speak to perhaps the linearity of orders in the communications business, sort of coming out of the January air pocket, it seems like the general tone just perhaps a little better than where we were three months ago?
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. Hi, Brandon, thanks for the question. The aerospace, defense business especially in the US was relatively steady. It’s been steady for a while and we obviously like the fact that continuing resolutions are gone and the fact that the budgets have been steady for a couple of years. So that's a market that we feel pretty good about. Gooi, also would like to a couple of comments please.
Gooi Soon Chai: Yes, Brandon, what I want to say is you remember, at last call we had announced the significant slowdown in the second half of January. While the quarter started similar, but our market stabilized over Q2. We kept executing on our plan and really delivered the order growth over last year. As Ron stated earlier, the most notable pullback continued to be in communication and our performance over the other end markets were steady outside of comms market. So we delivered solid mid single-digit order growth with the strength in aerospace, defense as Ron was mentioning and also in industrial.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. And then one for Neil. Can you remind us, do your you lap the warranty change this period and then with respect to the CSS operating margins, even the revs were flattish sequentially, the operating margin declined a little bit. Should we expect this to be sort of a low watermark and bounce back in a second half?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so first of all, with regard to the three year warranty, we are now at the point where we have – we've kind of led off all of the deferred revenue from the prior sales of extended warranties that are now covered under standard warranty program. But they will be in our compares through the first quarter of next year. And so from a year-over-year compare basis, we won't have lapped that until we get to that point. From an operating margin standpoint, as you noted, the operating margins are down versus where they had been last year. And I think essentially what you are seeing is that deferred revenue from this extended warranty sales are coming out of the revenue base that was very higher margin warranty and we need to grow the business and replace that warranty and get the revenues for this business up where they are over $100 million per quarter and we will see margins recover. We're highly confident in the investments and capacity that we are making and the ability of this business to generate profitability in line with the broader business moving forward.
Brandon Couillard: Super. Thank you.
Ronald Nersesian: Brandon, I'll just add one other comment with regard to our strength, if you look at orders in China we had double-digit order growth and I know everybody's concerned with what's going on in China. We have had a strategic focus of moving our business from manufacturing to R&D for years and I think that helps us with a result that we've seen that were pretty strong.
Brandon Couillard: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes, hi, Ron, Neil. Great results here, its really been weird, given many of your peers were noting fairly weak demand trends in term, so really buck the trend here.
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you.
Vijay Bhagavath: Question for, in terms of – yes, thanks. In terms of you know, help us understand anyway you can qualitative color on the communication end markets heading into the back half. Like, how should we look in terms of R&D spending into the back half from your customers? And then also what are your customers telling you it terms of their buying habits or Keysight equipment would they primarily be buying more of modular equipment, would they buying kind of the broader portfolio, are there any pockets of use cases of strength you see in the communication end market? Thank you.
Ronald Nersesian: Sure, I'll start with just entering the modular question and then I'll turn it over to Mike Gasparian who heads up our communications solutions group. With regards to modular, we saw double-digit growth for orders and double-digit growth for revenue. So we were very pleased with the strength. Aerospace, defense and optical in particular were strong, but it’s very good to see continued double-digit order and revenue growth in modular.
Michael Gasparian: Hi, Vijay, this is Mike Gasparian. Maybe I'll start out with a couple of macro comments about the communications industry. As Ron indicated in his opening comments, probably the biggest event during this previous quarter was the contraction in the overall supply-chain associated with the devices and chipsets and component manufacturer. So - but we also saw pretty big contraction in the R&D part of the communications market. A lot of the major accounts that operate in that ecosystem were still going through consolidation and restructuring and that's putting a real damper on their capital equipment spend. So that’s the - I think the color commentary I can make there. In regards to pockets of strength, we really do have a unique competitive advantage when you look at the data centers and what's going on there with a 100 gigabit rollout, as well as the 400 gigabit R&D spend, you know, more in the research phase. We're very well-positioned from a portfolio standpoint. We've got a variety of high-speed digital products that are ray testes, arbitrary waveform generators and in fact in the year of digital communication analyzers, we just introduced a new family of sampling scopes from one to four channels, very compact form factor, low noise and really designed for high throughput, in a manufacturing setting. So I think we will continue to benefit from that 100 gigabit build out. In the area of 5G, that's probably the other area to highlight and I'll go back to again some of Ron's comments about Mobile World Congress, several of us were there and met with a lot of customers and going into Mobile World Congress I think our general consensus was that we would see an initial deployment in the 6 gigahertz range. But what's happened since then it’s very clear that there will be at least a dual deployment and much higher frequency band, 28 gigahertz seems to be the sweet spot of a secondary implementation. And that really plays well into the product portfolio that we have and have had for decades on aerospace, defense side of the house. And so in fact, we had something called a 5G testbed that we put out which is a way for customers to upgrade their labs, to have test equipment that’s more compatible with the testing requirements of millimeter wave frequency and we've seen that testbed be very well accepted in the market and sales have far exceeded our expectations. And that's the primary driver behind our high 5G strength right now. So hopefully that helps give you a little bit of perspective.
Vijay Bhagavath: Yes. It’s really helpful. A quick follow-up is around gross margin and OpEx through the rest of year. Any guidelines can you give us for modeling? Thanks.
Ronald Nersesian: Yes, so first of all, with regard to gross margin, our gross margins are really driven more by product mix than anything else. And so I think as we look forward we don't really see any fundamental drivers that would change, would drive a meaningful shift in gross margin. Moving forward, with regard to OpEx, you'll notice that are OpEx is been reasonably stable through the first half of this year. Since the addition of Anite and from a modeling perspective I look to that moving forward.
Vijay Bhagavath: Excellent. Yes, congratulations. Thanks.
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you.
Operator: The next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton with Stifel. Your line is open.
Patrick Newton: Good afternoon, Neil and Ron. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess jumping right in, Neil, when you provided the guidance, and I am sorry, if I missed this, did you speak to your targeted core growth rate in the July quarter?
Neil Dougherty: I did, yes. The core growth rate is 2% and the absolute growth rate is 8%.
Patrick Newton: Okay, great. And then if we were to take into account, kind of the communications weakness, is there anyway you could comment on what kind of a core excluding communications would be?
Neil Dougherty: No, no, the only comment that I can say is that, we do continue to be very cautious around the communications space moving forward. We've taken the same approach that we always take to preparing our guidance looking at incoming order rates, strength of our funnel and the quality of our backlog. So as our approach to guidance this quarter was entirely consistent with prior quarters. The only thing that I would note is in the current quarter, in our second quarter we did post solid single digit growth rate outside of the comms area.
Patrick Newton: Okay, great. I guess maybe dovetailing off that, part of the - one of those areas that you touched on was industrial, which I guess is some – is kind of surprising, that was sighted as an area of strength, was that more just rebound off of a very depressed levels in the early calendar Q1 timeframe that we've seen a snap back from a lot of customers or is there something fundamentally that's reaccelerated in industrial end market?
Neil Dougherty: Yes, I think from an industrial orders perspective we had a reasonably strong quarter, but I would note that it was against a pretty soft compare from Q2 of last year. So we were certainly happy with the order results in industrial. If I was to provide you with a little bit of commentary, it was driven, the orders in the industrial side were stronger than the comms semi side, but again just note this is off compare from Q2 a year ago.
Patrick Newton: Great. And then I guess for either Ron or Mike, to extrapolate on your commentary on optical communications test. Can you help us understand the potential duration of this 100-gig strength, just seem this is historically a very volatile and cyclical end market? And then any way to help us understand or size this market opportunity or contribution to revenue given that there really is some very explosive growth opportunities here?
Ronald Nersesian: Yes, I'll let Neil comment about you know, can we quantify that, the magnitude of it. I can comment a little bit on the duration. We're re seeing a very broad widespread uptake in this whole 100 gigabit Ethernet build out in the manufacturing space. So I don't think that's a trend that's going to disappear overnight. In parallel with that, right on the heels we have the 400 gigabit wave that's coming and there is quite a bit of research going on in that phase, and the manufacturing deployment of that will likely be in late 2017. So I think we've got a pretty good trend to play to here over the next year or two.
Neil Dougherty: With regard to size we just don't provide granularity at that level to individual portions of our product platform, the only thing I would reiterate was the statements that Mike had made about we feel that we have a strong hand to play here and as he just said, we think its one that's got – got a little bit of legs.
Patrick Newton: Great. And then if I can get one more in on 5G, the 5G sales doubling again in the quarter year-over-year. Last quarter you give us a sequential growth rate of 50%, if you could provide us with the sequential growth rate that would be helpful. And then, could you also help us understand how we should think about 5G deployments moving out of the research phase and development into deployments with infrastructure in handset over the next several years, just how this wave, obviously it’s a very long tail, but just any type of thought process of X amount of years down the road is when we should start to see the handoff from one portion of your market to the next?
Neil Dougherty: I will take the first part of that question and then I'll hand off to Gooi for the second part, which is – we're not going to provide granularity on the sequential gain at this point in time. The more than doubling year-over-year is all that we can give you.
Gooi Soon Chai: Yes. Patrick, on the ramp, its very difficult to call at this moment, you've seen that Mobile World Congress, so its no doubt that it have shown acceleration currently in the market and with some customers, but I would say its too early to call when the ramp up is really going to happen.
Patrick Newton: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: The next question comes from Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman: Sure. Very nice quarter. Just Rob or maybe could you just kind of speak for a minute or two and maybe reconcile the service double-digit growth rate in orders with the sales growth rate here, without deferred it was up a percentage point and maybe are these multi-year orders? How do you reconcile those two and when does the sales growth rate start to approach that double digit order number? I am sorry, Ron, maybe that’s directed to you.
Ronald Nersesian: Yes, but I'm going to let John Page, who is the head of our services organization get a chance to talk.
John Page: So, I'm glad to answer that question. There are a number of factors going on, so yes, there are multiyear contracts in there and some of the contracts coming in a lumpy fashion, but I think the real underlying story here is that services is composed of two major components, one is our repair and calibration services business and that showed strong consistent growth. The other part of the equation is that we have a used equipment business that is also included in our services numbers and that's very lumpy and goes up and down depending on our demo inventory that's available for sale, as well as general product trends. So the underlying growth area for repair and calibration is very strong and used equipment continues to be a little bit lumpy.
Richard Eastman: I see. Okay. And the n just also, could you just provide a little bit of color, maybe on the end markets that are captured in the Americas 8% decline? I am just curious how comms, gen purpose and A&D did in the Americas?
Ronald Nersesian: We don't quantify the individual market segments by region, but I can – like Gooi see if he has any qualitative points that might be able to assist you.
Gooi Soon Chai: Richard, yes, this is Gooi, here. The think I can say is that in the Americas we did see as expected growth in aerospace, defense and this is where our tool for the DoD and for the time, but clearly comms was slow, especially with the large account and this comes back to the comment we did at the beginning of the call of still liked to the overall situation in the wireless industry.
Richard Eastman: Because again my math might be off a bit here, but it looks like if I pull Anite out of the numbers, the comms business was down high teens and your commentary around Asia I believe seem to maybe suggest that comms business did better there, but was the Americas comms business down more than 20%? And was that a comms issue or…
Gooi Soon Chai: We can't quantify that for you. Sorry.
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just one last observation, if I look at the revenue that you generated this quarter, the conversion of last quarter's orders to this quarter's revenue looks very seasonal. And I would make the same general argument about this quarter's orders if we get a typical conversion quarter-to-quarter it looks like you are almost at the midpoint of your guide. So I guess, Ron, do you kind of view the business here as kind of returning to maybe a more normal seasonal pattern off of this lower base?
Ronald Nersesian: We guide one quarter out obviously, there is a lot of - there are a lot of dynamics that happen within the marketplace. We're very glad that we've seen aerospace, defense business be steady. We're very glad that we see China being steady. We're glad that we see Russia return to growth. This quarter and last quarter in orders versus last year when we saw a lot of solid declines. So outside of comms, the backdrop is reasonable, but when you integrate comms it’s still a little uncertain. However, there is one thing that we're re very, very confident in, and we have a very good business model. We had to turn that into cash at the end of the day and produce the results that you've seen. So we'll keep at it and we think our relative position and our growth relative to the competition was pretty strong and I remember talking about two years ago about how we want - wanted to return to market growth and you can assess how we did relative to the other players in the industry and very pleased with our posted revenue growth and our profit growth, as well as our 9% order growth in the quarter.
Richard Eastman: If you turned out Ron, just I'm curious, if you trend out and you are looking at fiscal third quarter and fourth, you turned off seasonally, it might suggest your business is up overall Keysight growth would be up low single digits. And a prime competitor in Japan kind of gave their fiscal March '17 outlook and kind of put industry growth for test and measurement at zero flat. So just trying to get maybe reconciles the growth rate here. Do you feel at this point in time the Keysight in fact is outgrowing the industry? Or do you feel that, as the industry growth rate low single digits, is a flat or its just - put that in context for us?
Ronald Nersesian: Well, clearly the macro is still very uncertain as you can see. You, look, you could also look at all the competitors and see what they posted during the last quarter relative to what we posted. But at this point Japan still is soft and we see the comp semi business to be not so strong. China clearly they are making some significant investments in Semiconductor, but the question is how long or what will happen at the end of the year. So it is still a very uncertain background, but as we have guided the last almost nine quarters independently from Agilent from the first quarters before we split until now we have met our guidance every single quarter. So hopefully that gives you some confident.
Richard Eastman: Okay, very good. Thank you.
Ronald Nersesian: Thanks, Richard
Operator: We have time for one last question. And the question comes from the line of Toshi Ahari [ph] with Goldman Sachs.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Alex actually on Toshi. First of all congratulations on the strong quarter. I have a quick question on capital allocation. You obviously repurchase the shares to this last quarter, any updated thoughts here, specifically around the M&A environment how you all look at repurchases?
Ronald Nersesian: Yes, so obviously we've instituted the share repurchase program last quarter. We executed about 20% of it during Q2 and that’s really designed to be an opportunistic program that - and you can read into the fact that we executed a significant portion of that, that we have confidence in our ability to perform in a variety of market conditions. Are stated strategic priorities haven’t changed. We continue to look for M&A opportunities that will help us to achieve our longer-term growth objectives. But at the same time when the opportunities present itself we will continue to execute on the share repurchase program, as well although we don't give any particular color as to what our plans are as regard to that execution.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Got it. And then on the defense business, you all saw good growth here, commenting on the next quarter looking similar, I guess just a question on how lumpy this business is and how strong of a line of sight you have moving into the back half of this year?
Ronald Nersesian: Our aerospace defense business Alex has been very steady. It modulated down a bit when there were continuing resolutions going on. But overall, if you look at the threats line of that business for 16 years since we split from Hewlett-Packard not Agilent, its pretty darn steady compared to any of our other businesses. And again, we're the prime player in the United States, the United States is the largest spender in the world by large amount. We believe in the long-term that there will be bringing in new programs to strengthen our ability to deal with new types of threats and we are very pleased with the position that's there. We don't expect any instantaneous sharp turns up or sharp turns down, but we feel very comfortable with our position. It’s also worthwhile to note that are aerospace defense business is not only in the US that's also overseas and although it’s somewhere around the third of our business, a lot of the business for the international countries are sold through US primes. So in total a higher percentage of our business goes to international countries approaching 50%. So we're very well balanced with US and with other countries. We've had a very steady business in that area and we're looking forward to capitalize on any gains in any defense spending around the world.
Neil Dougherty: I think we can also say that with the relative stability in the US budget situation over the past couple of years we do expect euros base defense spending to return to typical norms as you think about government fiscal year end in September.
Q – Unidentified Analyst: Correct, got it. Thanks again and congrats on the quarter.
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you very much, Alex.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn conference back to Jason Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you and thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing you at that coming investor conferences that I mentioned at the top of the call and have a great day.

Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, all for joining us. Keysight delivered strong first quarter results, driven by our operational discipline. We continue to execute on our key initiatives as we transform our business and create value for our customers, partners, and shareholders. We will focus today discussing on three important headlines. First, our first quarter financial results were strong with earnings and revenue both above the midpoint of our guidance and we made solid progress on our four growth initiatives. Second, we remain committed to delivering solid profitability in line with our operating model despite macro headwinds. We are currently actions to exercise the cost flexibility of the model to delivery high-teens operating margin in this environment. At the same time, we are executing our strategy and making the R&D investments that should drive above market performance when markets stabilize. And third, consistent with our phased approach to return of capital, the board of directors has authorized a $200 million share repurchase program. This action demonstrates our confidence in our ability to achieve above market growth in the long-term and our commitment to delivering shareholder value. Now let's start with an overview of Keysight's first quarter performance. In Q1, revenue grew 4% year-over-year and we delivered $0.55 in earnings per share, which was $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue for the quarter grew to $726 million, including revenue from our recent acquisitions. On a core basis, which excludes revenue from acquisitions and the impact of currency, revenue declined 1%, consistent with our expectations. We continued to execute on our strategic growth initiatives and are building momentum in these areas with innovative solutions that help customers design leading edge technologies and bring their products to market faster. First, in wireless, we are making solid progress on affirming Keysight as the market leader in 5G, including forming long-term strategic partnerships. In the first quarter, while off a small base, orders for 5G solutions more than doubled year-over-year and grew over 50% sequentially, as customers invest in early 5G research. We continue to collaborate with consortiums, working to establish worldwide 5G standards. We are the first company to offer a commercial 5G channel sounding solution. Our solution includes our channel sounding reference solution, instrumentation to measure and interpret how signals behave at high frequencies, and our industry leading SystemVue design and simulation software to develop and validate new designs. We are proud to announce that in the first quarter a leading research center in China selected our 5G channel sounding solution as the foundation for their 5G channel modeling research. Our 5G channel sounding solution is now used in research centers in the U.K., Malaysia and China, and it has enabled us to secure several competitive wins. Early strategic relationships with research centers around the globe are critical to our 5G leadership in the longer term. We will showcase our 5G channel sounding solution along with our 5G beamforming and 802.11ad testing and design tools at Mobile World Congress, where I will be next week with the Keysight team. Outside of 5G, we are gaining momentum with our newly introduced LTE-Advanced RF conformance solutions. This combined software and hardware solution offers best-in-class coverage for 3GPP industry standards and the flexibility for future technology evolutions. In the first quarter, two major chipset vendors, two leading carriers and a major testing lab, each selected our LTE-Advanced solution for testing complex radios with multiple bands and carriers. Moving to our modular initiative, our PXI and AXIe modular products, again, delivered solid double-digit growth. New products in high-speed digital and optical solutions drove our modular growth this quarter. Introducing new modular solutions to market is a key component to expanding our share in this growing part of our market. In the quarter, we introduced our first PXI reference solution for military, public safety and avionics radio test. Additionally, for the automotive market, we introduced the Body and Safety Electronics reference solution that includes both instruments and software. Moving to our software growth initiative, we continue to realize strong year-over-year revenue growth for our market leading design and simulation software solutions. As an example of our continued success with this platform, we recently were awarded a $12 million multi-year software contract from a major wireless customer. Keysight's design and simulation software is used by two-thirds of the world's high-frequency designers. You can see from the wireless and modular products I just mentioned that software solutions play an important role in our strategy to expand our business. Furthermore, the addition of Anite broadens our software portfolio. Our integration efforts are going well and tracking to expectations. And, by leveraging the Keysight sales force, we have identified additional opportunities to sell Anite solutions into our Aerospace and Defense market. We plan to meet many of our joint Anite and Keysight customers at Mobile World Congress, where we will be also showcasing Anite's recently launched Virtual Drive Testing Toolset that was already selected by a major mobile operator in China to verify mobile device performance in high-speed train scenarios. And lastly, looking at our services initiative, we continue to secure new business in North America and Europe with our multi-vendor calibration and asset management capabilities. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the three-year warranty program and currency, our services revenue grew 11% year-over-year. We are partnering with our customers to create value and help them manage assets and costs. For example, we recently worked with an Aerospace and Defense customer to measurably improve the use of their assets, reduce test time and increase yields – all in an effort to reduce test and design engineering and capital equipment expense. Our services plan included test system integration, test flow consulting and instrument and system level software functionality. And while we provided great value in helping this customer reduce their overall design expenses, their spending with Keysight more than tripled year-over-year. Moving on to our markets, as we discussed in November, we expected macro factors to suppress first half market growth. While orders tracked to our expectations for the majority of the quarter, we saw a significant slowdown in January as weakening macro factors in the broader markets negatively impact sentiment towards capital expense purchases. This effected order patterns across our end markets with the most notable pullback in Communications where our wireless supply chain customers paused spending following lowered estimates for wireless component and smartphone shipments. As a result, first quarter orders were down 2% year-over-year, and this is reflected in our second quarter guidance, which Neil will discuss in more detail. While we continue to see continued market softness in the near term, we remain committed to delivering profit within our operating model and at the same time investing in our growth initiatives. We believe Keysight is well positioned to grow when the market stabilizes and customers reaccelerate capital investments. The progress we made on our growth initiatives in the first quarter demonstrates that we are investing in the right areas and are creating value for our customers and partners by bringing leading edge solutions and services to market. While strategic M&A remains our priority use of cash, the $200 million share repurchase program we announced today reflects our confidence in our strategy and our ability to achieve above market growth in the long-term. Now I will turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q1 financial results, as well as our second-quarter guidance.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Today we reported first quarter total non-GAAP revenue of $726 million that was above the midpoint of our guidance. On a year-over-year basis, this represents 4% growth. On a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions, revenue declined 1% year-over-year in line with our expectations. GAAP revenue for the quarter was $721 million, which excludes certain accounting adjustments associated with revaluing pre-acquisition deferred revenue from Anite. Looking at our top line performance by end market, Communications revenue grew 8% year-over-year including revenue from Anite. Excluding Anite, Communications revenue decreased in the low double-digit range year-over-year as restructuring and consolidation activities impacted spending patterns and softness from customers in the smartphone supply chain outweighed growth in LTE-Advanced and 5G technology. Revenue from Aerospace and Defense was $171 million, a decline of $3 million or 1% from last year's first quarter, which was the high point for 2015. Growth in the U.S. for our Aerospace and Defense solutions was offset by continued softness in Europe and Asia. First quarter Industrial, Computer and Semiconductor revenue grew 3% driven by strong sales from our instrument and parametric test products and next generation processor testing. Regionally, and on a core basis, revenue was flat in the Americas, up 1% in Europe and grew 16% in Japan. Revenue in Asia excluding Japan declined 7%. The regional mix of total revenue was 38% from the Americas, 20% from Europe, and 42% from Asia. Our first quarter operational results were strong with gross margin increasing to 56.6%, a 100 basis point improvement year-over-year as a result of a higher percentage of software and R&D revenue. Expenses were well-managed while we continued to invest in R&D programs in support of our growth initiatives. Operating expenses totaled $282 million, including the first full quarter of Anite spending. Operating margin was 17.8 %, in line with the prior year. Our industry-leading margins result from our continued operational discipline and the proactive management of our cost structure across the cycle. Non-GAAP net income after taxes was $95 million, or $0.55 per share, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Moving to the results of our two operating segments. Measurement Solutions generated first quarter revenue of $631 million, an increase of 4% including revenue from Anite. Operating margin for Measurement Solutions was 18.3%. The Customer Support and Services segment generated revenue of $95 million in Q1, up 2% on a core basis, with an operating margin of 13.9%. As a reminder, the Services business has a higher fixed cost structure when compared to our Measurement Solutions business. The Q1 cost structure also reflects the investments we are making in additional capacity to expand our multi-vendor calibration and asset management services. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with $572 million in cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately 75% is located offshore. In the quarter, we generated $92 million in cash flow from operations. As I mentioned last quarter, cash flow is seasonally lower in Q1 due to the payout of variable compensation. In addition, we had higher capital purchases this quarter totaling $34 million, which brought our free cash flow to $58 million. As Ron mentioned, our board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $200 million. The new repurchase program goes into effect immediately and shares may be purchased from time to time. The program will be funded from current and future cash flows, and is consistent with our phased approach to return of capital. While we remain focused on identifying M&A opportunities that will help us achieve our growth objectives, this repurchase authorization reflects our confidence in our growth opportunities and strong cash flow generation. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the second quarter. Taking into account our order performance in the first quarter and the broader market sentiment, we expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $695 million to $735 million, which at the midpoint reflects a 3% decline, or 9% on a core basis. With our ongoing attention to cost management and the leverage and flexibility of our operating model, we expect to deliver operating profit in the high-teens, while continuing to invest in the growth areas of our business. Balancing these factors, we expect second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.48 to $0.62 and our weighted diluted share count to be approximately 173 million shares. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason A. Kary - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President: Thank you, Neil. Tracy, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: And your first question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Yes. Ron, could you maybe speak a little bit to the Communications business? And excluding Anite, which looks like it came in from a revenue standpoint about as expected, just speak to the core decline in Communications. I think math suggests maybe around 12%. Just a little bit of color on the pieces there. And maybe on the order side, how did orders fare in the quarter for the Comm business?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Rick. I'll turn this over to Mike Gasparian who leads that business, but let me make a couple of comments. You're right, on a core basis, we were down 11%. There are a couple things that are going on in the industry. First, there is consolidation of some players, there's restructuring, also and both of those things lead to a rationalization of spending. On top of that, you've heard about some of the contraction in the smartphone supply chain that's going on from some big players. So that's the macro picture of what's going on in the market overall. Our strategy has been, and it's been a multiyear strategy and we continue to make progress on it, is to move from wireless manufacturing to more of our business in wireless R&D. Wireless R&D has higher gross margins. It is a business that is more differentiated than manufacturing and is less cyclical or has less volatility than manufacturing. And I'm glad to report that our wireless R&D business is bigger than our wireless manufacturing business now by a good bit. And we'll continue to move towards a larger and larger percentage of our business being in wireless R&D with Anite being added. Our wireless R&D business with Anite grew, our wireless manufacturing business contracted and our other Communications which leads really into a lot of the fiber and a lot of the backhaul Communications also grew on a revenue basis. So, with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for a few comments.
Michael C. Gasparian - Senior Vice President and President, Communications Solutions Group: Yeah, let me just add little color to that. I think, Ron, outlining a number of short-term factors that will put the Communications market under pressure. Nevertheless we believe there are still excellent long-term growth opportunities in the Communications segment, people will continue to invest in the evolution. As we go from 4G to 5G, there will be many points at which we'll get additional investments. And then we're seeing a really good uptick in the 5G research space. Our 5G orders have doubled in this most recent quarter, it's still on a small base, but it does reflect a number of engagements we have with research institutions around the world, and we have delivered a number of very unique solutions which will be showcasing at Mobile World Congress next week, where several of us will be there interacting with our key customers.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And one other comment, a question that you asked Rick was, how our orders in the Communications sector with Anite? Our orders were up slightly in total. So our comps business is up slightly, but that includes an acquisition.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. And just maybe Ron, one other thought. On the modular test side, again good double-digit growth. Is the growth coming heavily or is the growth heavily slanted towards the Communications business (22:33)?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. The Communications business is one significant part, plus also if you look at not only wireless R&D in general, but what we call other Communications, we're seeing a lot digital applications move over to modular. So, we have both of those areas or both of those subgroups in Communications that are moving. But as we expand our portfolio, you'll see more and more solutions in the industrial space too, which will allow us to make some traction against some competitors.
Richard Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You're welcome. Thanks, Rick.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, good afternoon. Ron, just sort of a big picture question for you. You've been with this business obviously a long time, been through several cycles over the past decade or so. How do you view the macro environment today relative to let's say the past few cycles? In terms of demand picture and what's different today versus what this business was like ala 2009 or prior?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I have seen many cycles over the last 35 years, this one is pretty typical. And to be very honest, we don't have very good visibility on this cycle. There's a lot of things that are being created from the overall macro environment of the markets which is causing folks to hold on to their wallet. But let me give you some color commentary on to what happened this quarter. Our orders were tracking to expectations right through mid January. And as you know, a lot of the compares that you see, they report results or have reported results through December. But in January, in the middle of January, we saw a market slowdown in our incoming orders, and that's not inconsistent of what you've seen from some other larger players in the overall electronics markets. This macro uncertainty that is there, has caused people to pull back on CapEx and has caused customers to be much more cautious. So, if you look at that, if your revenue growth for the quarter was 4%, but if you look at our order growth it was minus 2%, but on a core basis it was minus 5%. And given this macro uncertainty, it's probable that the 2% market growth that we saw before this real, let's say, disconnect in January will probably not play out. Now what we're doing about it is we're taking action. We have an operating model, because we know our business has some cyclicality and this model allows us to deliver strong cash flow and solid double-digit operating margin throughout the cycle. And as you see, and as Neil mentioned in his script even in Q2, we're planning to deliver upper teens operating margin. And this is all why – while we continue to invest in growth and continue with our strong R&D programs in modular, software, wireless, and services. And we're getting great traction on all of those fronts. So, bringing it back, this cycle is not that untypical. I think when the markets stabilize, you may see some performance begin to return. So little unclear how quickly it will return, but again, we're talking about minus 5% core revenue growth in Q1.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Thanks, that's helpful. And just to be clear, do you have a revised market growth outlook for the year? And would that be simply a function of comms, and do I understand your comments that suggests that ICS and the aerospace and defense orders actually held up pretty well through January?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. We don't have a revised market forecast for the full year. Actually, we'd expect with the kind of inflection point that we saw in orders in mid-January, our visibility out beyond, really beyond more than one quarter is increasingly limited. And so it's very difficult to call. I think as Ron said, it's highly unlikely at this point that we see 2% growth. But we do not have an updated forecast based on the 5% order decline, the core order decline that we saw in Q1.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And when we see some of these big macro cycles and while we continue to generate great cash, sometimes it provides great opportunities for us to create value for our shareholders by doing share repurchase programs. We've talked in the past about still, number one, our priority is to fund strategic M&A, but we will be opportunistic when we can create value for our shareholders with buybacks such as we're doing right now. So I really believe we know how (28:08) to manage this business through the cycles to deliver profitability and to create shareholder value for the long term.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. And then one more for Neil, just on the CapEx side, was there something one-time in the front-end loading in the first quarter? And do you have a target that we should expect for the full year?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. I wouldn't read more into that than it should. Some of the equipment that we buy is longer lead time and the actual cash flowing is a function of acceptance and installation and the rest. But we still intend to manage our overall CapEx budget to the year to the same $90 million to $100 million range that we put out in the past. And so just a little bit of a timing difference caused that to be more front-end loaded this year.
Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thanks, Brandon.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is now open.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Good afternoon, Ron and Neil. Thank you for taking my questions. I'm sorry if missed this in the prepared remarks, but just kind of looking at the Customer Support and Services gross margin below 40% for the first time in our historical model. I'm curious if you could talk through some of the impacts and maybe the duration of some of the pressures there.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. Happy to do that. If you think about our services business, it's a higher fixed cost business when you compare it to the rest of Keysight. As you can see, our Q1 revenue was – were down in that segment, but that's as compared to kind of the run rates over the second half of last year, they were flat to Q1. But compared to the second half, when profitability was much higher, revenues were down. But you'll notice that the costs in that business are very stable. As we noted in prior quarters, we're still navigating through a change in our standard warranty from one year to three years, and that impacted the sale of extended warranties in that business and we're still essentially working through the impact to deferred revenue. We're losing about $7 million per quarter in deferred revenue as those previously sold extended warranties work their way through our P&L. This quarter, incidentally, will be the last quarter and we'll be through that, although it'll still be in our compares for remaining year. But the underlying growth rate of the business is strong. We mentioned the 11% growth rate if you adjust for that warranty impact and for currency, and we're confident that the profitability of that business will be in the upper teens over the longer term as we're continuing to make investments to grow that business, particularly in the areas of multi-vendor calibration and asset management.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great, okay. And then just a few modular questions for you. I guess just given the double-digit growth that you're seeing in modular in the face of macro headwinds that are hitting the rest of the business, is this growth stemming from the broadening of your portfolio? Is it stemming from share gains? Or conversely, do you think that it's having a negative impact or perhaps cannibalizing the rest of your business? And then could you also remind us the relative size of your modular business currently?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. First of all, I think it's a mix. Some of the products that we're selling were products that were sold in the past in our feature-rich boxes, but a lot of it is also incremental. There are customers that want modular solutions for some reasons why it is a distinct advantage and we continue to win that business against the competition. Our business, we talked about last year at Investor Day about being approximately $150 million of our new modular products and we talked about that in September and we did achieve or beat the $150 million last year and this year, we're just saying we've grown 11% from Q1.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: The 11% is not a modular growth, we grew – that we grew double digits.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then just this last one if I may is on the R&D side, you talked several times in the prepared remarks about a continued focus on investing in R&D and still maintaining that solid teens op margin even through this challenged time. But I'm curious now with you being a standalone company for over a year, is the 13% R&D target still the right number? Is that still the right way to think about it? I think that some would argue that on an absolute basis is a very aggressive R&D spend and more than enough. While others would argue that as a percentage of revenue, you're still running well below peers. So any thoughts around is 13% the right way to think about R&D?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We're looking at what does it take to win in the marketplace, and what do we need to do to accomplish our strategy. We spent 12% in the past. We up that to 13% last year. And clearly, as the top line moves around you will see that percentage vary. There is no doubt that on a total basis, we're spending less than the competition on average, but we do have some economies of scale from having our own, for instance, internal fab that can go ahead and provide products and solutions to multiple businesses and multiple product lines. As far as the R&D percentage, we're going to monitor that with regards to our ability to go ahead and to win in these marketplaces. But I think it's directionally correct.
Patrick Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Good luck.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure.
Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Anjaya Shrestha - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Can you guys hear me?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Hi, Vijay.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Hi.
Anjaya Shrestha - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. This is AJ Shrestha in actually for Vijay Bhagavath. Just had two questions really. The first one was trying to get your thoughts on the product mix for the rest of the year. Should we expect a higher percentage in software mix? And the other one is the OpEx, how should we think about that for the rest of the year?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, let me try and address those questions. I think we are making a concerted effort over time to shift the mix of our business towards more R&D solutions and more software. But if you put that in the scale of the rest of the year, our markets – our markets don't move that quickly, you're not going to see fundamental shifts in our mix. Based on those efforts, over that short of period of time, it's a bit more of a methodical slog than that. With regard to our OpEx, again, we'll be working hard to manage our spending as we move through this economic cycle. But our Q1 results, now reflect a full quarter of Anite spending and you could view those as representative of what we expect for the remaining quarters of the year.
Anjaya Shrestha - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Okay, appreciate it guys.
Operator: Thank you. That was our last question. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to the turn the conference back to Jason Kary.
Jason A. Kary - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President: Thank you, Tracy. That's all we have for today. So thank you everyone for joining the call and have a good day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q4  (2015-11-19 16:30:00) =====

Analysts: Brandon Couillard - Jefferies Rob Mason - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Chelsea Jurman - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies' Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Melissa, and I will be your lead operator today. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 19, 2015, at 1:30 P.M. Pacific Time. I would now like to hand the conference over to Jason Kary, Keysight Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Melissa, and welcome to Keysight's fourth quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2015. With me today are Neil Dougherty, Keysight's Senior Vice President and CFO, and Senior Vice Presidents Guy Séné and Mike Gasparian. Unfortunately, Ron Nersesian, Keysight President and CEO, is unable to join us today. He has hurt his back and he is out of the office for a few days. I will cover Ron's prepared remarks on his behalf before turning the call over to Neil for his comments. Neil, Mike and Guy will then handle the Q&A. As always, you can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.keysight.com. While there, please click on the link for Quarterly Reports under Financial Information. There you'll find an investor presentation along with Keysight's segment results. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call. Today's comments by me and Neil will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please review the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. Now let's turn to our results for the quarter and the year. Our strong Q4 performance contributed to a solid first year as an independent company. Beginning with four headlines. First, in Q4, we delivered strong profit in a soft market by leveraging the strength of Keysight's business model. This was the seventh consecutive quarter that we delivered financial results at or above the midpoint of our revenue and EPS guidance. Second, we demonstrated strong operational and strategic execution by closing two acquisitions and launching services as a fourth growth initiative for Keysight. Third, we announced the change in our company's organizational structure to focus on customer solutions and accelerate growth. Fourth, and now looking forward, we are holding to our 2% market growth expectation for 2016. However, recent macro data has tempered our expectations for the first half of the year. It's been an exciting year, and a good quarter, so let's move to the specifics of Keysight's performance. In Q4, we generated $756 million of revenue, just above the midpoint of our guidance and delivered $0.71 in EPS which was at the high end of our guidance range. In line with our expectations, revenue for the quarter was down 1% year-over-year on an as reported and core basis which excludes currency and acquisitions. While we did see a strong seasonal rebound in our business from Q3, end market performance in Q4 was mixed. Communications grew 3% year-over-year with growth in wireless R&D and the addition of Anite. That growth was offset by a decline in wireless manufacturing. Aerospace, Defense declined 5%, versus a strong Q4 FY 2014 compare. As you may recall, last year, Q4 FY 2014 was a high point for our Aerospace, Defense business following the post-sequestration recovery. In Q4, Industrial, Computer and Semiconductor declined 2% with growth in computer and semiconductor markets offset by a decline in industrial markets. Regionally, Asia-Pacific and Japan grew on a core basis while Americas and Europe declined. Despite the recent headlines, China remains steady and grew 1% year-over-year. Against this backdrop, Keysight built backlog for the second quarter in a row as core orders, excluding currency and acquisition, increased 1% and our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was above 1. In Q4, we also demonstrated strong operational and strategic execution by closing two acquisitions - Anite and Electroservices - and launching services as a fourth growth initiative. The Anite integration efforts are going well and tracking to expectations. As we communicated at our Investor Day in September, the Anite business strengthens our wireless software design and test portfolio, and expands our served addressable markets with the addition of network test solutions. Anite truly is a key component of Keysight's strategy to be first in 5G wireless solutions. And in Q4, we made additional progress with our 5G wireless initiative. Our wireless R&D business grew year-over-year, highlighted by orders for our market-leading 5G solutions, and we continue to gain tractions and collaborations with industry consortiums, universities and research institutes around the world, including our newest collaborations with China Southeast University, and the University of Bristol in the UK. 5G opportunities will materialize in the communications market over the next five to 10 years. Our customers will need new tools for 5G which includes certain emerging IoT or Internet of Things applications, driven by faster data connections and electronic devices connecting everything from cars to appliances. Turning to our services initiative. The second acquisition that we closed this quarter is Electroservices Enterprises Limited, a UK-based company, specializing in test equipment service and solutions. As a result of this acquisition, we have already won a large multiyear, multivendor service contract. The Electroservices acquisition supports our newest initiative to grow Keysight services. Our focus on growing services through multivendor calibration and asset management builds upon a strong foundation and expands our overall market by $1 billion. In Q4, we saw a solid revenue growth from the services business. So let's look at how our other initiatives performed in Q4. Expanding our modular solutions is another multiyear growth objective. In Q4, our modular business continued to perform very well. In fact, our modular PXI and AXIe orders topped $150 million for the year. With greater than 60% year-over-year growth in fiscal year 2015, we believe Keysight is growing faster than our competitors in the modular segment of the market. And finally, we continue to focus on expanding our software business. This was a record year for our electronic design automation software platform. These software tools are used by two thirds of the world's wireless designers and are playing a significant role in early 5G work around the world. We are executing on a number of opportunities to grow our software business, including growing recurring revenues through software subscriptions and services. Here too, Anite plays a strong role with their wireless R&D software solutions. We continue to make good progress with all of our initiatives, as we transform our company to create more value for customers and shareholders. With our ongoing R&D investment and innovation, Keysight releases multiple new solutions each quarter that help our customers bring breakthrough electronic products to market faster and at a lower cost. Here are three examples from Q4. The first is in software where we introduced the latest version of our BenchVue Platform. Among other capabilities, BenchVue allows design engineers to graphically automate measurements without the need for programming. The second is in modular, where we introduced the industry's highest performance PXIe Multiport Vector Network Analyzer aimed at high volume manufacturing of wireless components used in mobile phones and base stations. And third, we also introduced the industry's first handheld 50 gigahertz combination analyzer that delivers laboratory-grade measurements for field testing of radar and satellite systems. As you can see, we accomplished a lot in Q4 and in our first 12 months as an independent company. And we did it while meeting our financial commitments and keeping customer satisfaction at a very high level. Going into fiscal year 2016, Keysight will continue to focus on providing industry leading services with solutions as no other electronic design and test company can. To that end, this month we announced a new organizational design with expanded leadership to focus everything we do on our end markets and the development of complete customer solutions. The organizational changes include the creation of a centralized corporate planning and technology team and a move to three customer-focused business groups - the Communications Solutions Group, the Industrial Solutions Group and the Services Solutions Group. These organizational changes are the next step in our evolution and are designed to focus our company, processes and people directly on customers and the development of the solutions they need to succeed in their industries. We are proud of our successes and the results that we have delivered in our first year as an independent company. We enter our second year with momentum, a focused strategy and a team that is completely aligned to create value for customers and shareholders in FY 2016. Now I would turn the call over to Neil to provide more details on our Q4 financial results, as well as our first quarter guidance.
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Jason, and hello, everyone. As Jason mentioned, Q4 was a strong finish to our first fiscal year as a new company. Fourth quarter revenues of $756 million that were just above the midpoint of our guidance declined 1% year-over-year on both on as reported and core basis. Currency had a negative impact of four percentage points, offset by four percentage points of growth from acquisitions. Regionally, and on a core basis, revenue declined 6% in the Americas and 3% in Europe. Japan revenues improved 2% year-over-year, while Asia excluding Japan grew 5%. The regional mix of total revenues was consistent with prior periods, with 39% from the Americas, 18% from Europe, and 43% from Asia. Gross margins increased 190 basis points year-over-year, as our mix of R&D and software revenues improved. Expenses were well managed while we continue to invest in R&D programs in support of our growth initiatives. Operating profit performance for the quarter was good, with a Q4 operating margin of 20.7%. Non-GAAP net income after-tax was $122 million or $0.71 per share which was at the high end of guidance. Shifting briefly to GAAP results, you will note that GAAP net income was significantly higher than usual this quarter due to a material deferred tax benefit recognized in Q4. This tax benefit resulted primarily from a ruling obtained from Singapore that allows us to amortize the value of the intellectual property acquired from Agilent in the separation. In addition, this quarter, we substantially completed the purchase price accounting and IFRS to GAAP accounting adjustments associated with the acquisition of Anite. GAAP rules require us to revalue certain pre-acquisition revenue classified by Anite as deferred. Consistent with standard industry practice, we will include the amortization of pre-acquisition deferred revenue in our non-GAAP quarterly revenue reporting, which will then reflect our true business performance on a normalized basis. Going forward, GAAP accounting will also require us to defer and amortize a larger portion of revenue than Anite had previously under IFRS accounting standards. While increasing the portion of our revenue that's recurring is a positive, this change will drive a revenue and corresponding profit reduction of approximately $12 million versus our prior expectations, all in the first half of FY 2016. For the year, this adjustment moves our accretion expectations for Anite to the low end of the $0.14 to $0.17 range that we previously communicated. Given this adjustment, we are not expecting Anite to be accretive in Q1 of 2016 Turning to full year results. Fiscal 2015 has been a highly successful first year for Keysight. We launched the company, completed the separation and stabilized our operations. We made significant organic and inorganic investments to drive future growth. We increased our investment in R&D to 13% of revenue and we completed the acquisition of Anite, significantly improving our competitive positioning in our wireless communications end markets. In addition to these accomplishments, Keysight generated strong financial results in fiscal 2015. Full year revenues of $2.9 billion were flat on a core basis. Gross margins improved 80 basis points to 56.9% as we shifted the mix of our business to more R&D and software solutions. We exercise excellent discipline as we transition to operating as an independent company which allowed us to generate 19.5% operating margin for the year. Non-GAAP net income after-tax was $432 million or $2.52 per share. Cash generation was also solid for the year with $376 million of cash from operations. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $92 million resulting in $284 million of free cash flow. We closed the year with cash and cash equivalents of $483 million and total debt of $1.1 billion. Moving to the results of our two operating segments. Measurement Solutions generated fourth quarter revenue of $653 million, down 3% on a core basis, with an operating margin of 21%. Full year Measurement Solutions revenues were $2.5 billion, a decline of 1% on a core basis. Full year operating margin was 19.8%. The Customer Support and Services segment generated revenue of $103 million in Q4, up 8% on a core basis, with an operating margin of 19.5%. Full year Customer Support and Services revenues were $401 million, an increase of 4% on a core basis. Full year operating margin was 17.9%. Looking forward to fiscal 2016. Several of the macro indicators that we monitor have weakened over the past quarter. The IMF reduced their 2016 forecast of global GDP. PMI data has fluctuated and China growth remains uncertain. While we still expect the broader electronic design and test market to grow at approximately 2% this coming year, the softening of these macro indicators has tempered our expectations for the first half of the year. A few items to note as you adjust your model for fiscal 2016. Our annual salary increases are effective December 1, 2015, other operating income is projected to be $12 million, interest expense for the year is projected to be $44 million. And lastly, we are assuming a diluted share count of 174 million shares by yearend. Turning to our outlook and guidance for the first quarter. We do expect Q1 to follow our typical seasonality, with lower revenues in the range of $702 million to $742 million, which at the midpoint reflects 3% growth or a core decline of 1%. As I've mentioned previously, expenses are also seasonally higher in our fiscal first quarter, which results in lower Q1 profitability. Given the combined effect of seasonally lower revenue and higher expenses, we expect first quarter non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.58. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A.
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you give the instructions for the Q&A please?
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Neil Dougherty: Hi, Brandon.
Brandon Couillard: Thanks. Good afternoon. Neil or Jason, I guess, in the context of fiscal 2016 looking a little softer in the first half, on a full year basis, which are the three primary end markets do you view has the strongest tailwinds, or those that are facing challenges? And if I understand your comments right, are you suggesting a stronger second half outlook than perhaps you initially anticipate to get to the full year?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. So this is Neil. I'll let Guy comment on kind of our view of the markets going forward. But I think as we look at our performance in FY 2015, and our expectations going into FY 2016, that your statement about stronger second half is accurate. We obviously had a relatively weak Q3, a softer Q4 than normal giving us relatively easier compares in the second half of FY 2016 and then some headwinds here as I mentioned from macro as well as the aerospace defense situation coming out of Q4. So I'm going to let Guy comment more broadly on the market situation.
Guy Séné: Yeah. Brandon, you may remember on September 1 at the Analyst Day, we gave forward-looking numbers of expectations for each of the market segments that on the long term was around 2% to 3% for our market growth, with comps being 1% to 2% and the two other segments, Aerospace, Defense and ICS being in the 2% to 3%. We also had said that we'll see fiscal year 2016 on this lower end of this, with average of 2% market growth for 2016. So as I think we said in Ron's prepared comments is that we still see this 2%. The market segments themselves are - the one that is probably slower in the first half is aerospace, defense. We have seen a slower Q4 in Aerospace, Defense, mostly driven by our budget - the end of year budget that we usually see from our government in the U.S. spending did not happen. This will mean a slower Q1 for Aerospace, Defense. The other markets [indiscernible] very well aligned with the expectation for going forward in this year.
Brandon Couillard: Super. And then just one more on Anite. Neil, just to confirm was 100% of the revenue contribution there captured within the Communications segment and then could you give us an update on the integration progress. Exactly where you are in terms of getting down the cost synergy pathway?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. So the answer to your first question is, yes, we captured all of the Anite revenue within the Communications segment in terms of our industry segmentation. And Guy Séné is actually heading up the integration of Anite. So let me allow him to take the second part of that question.
Guy Séné: Yeah. Remember with Anite, what we're doing is really strengthen our wireless solution portfolio and expand our served addressable market. And now with 13 weeks into the acquisition for Anite, I must say we're very pleased on the overall integration. All the milestones that we have set so far being on track. We see good engagement on both sides from the employees, working on the plans. We're currently aligning our roadmaps and portfolios, so that we are completely ready to communicate this by Mobile World Congress in February. And I must say all the communication and discussions we have with customers are going extremely well. So we are very pleased at this stage.
Brandon Couillard: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. Your line is open.
Neil Dougherty: Hi, Patrick.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi guys. Good afternoon. This is [indiscernible] for Patrick.
Neil Dougherty: Hi, James [ph].
Unidentified Analyst: How is it going? Can you remind us about some of the specific drivers behind increasing service revenue to your $600 million target annually by 2020? And then also maybe quantify some of the additional costs that will be associated with building out and expanding your service to support infrastructure?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. Mike, do you want to go ahead and take that one?
Michael Gasparian: Sure. Hi, [ph] James. Yeah. You're really referring to the Analyst Day presentation, where we laid out this exciting opportunity to grow this business to $600 million over the next five years. It's really a great long-term opportunity. And as Ron said in his prepared comments read by Jason, over $1 billion in new served addressable market. We did have a really solid year with 4% core growth and even better finish with 8% growth in Q4, and the drivers really remained the same. The highlight is really the opportunity in calibration. There's two parts to that. Part one is we're pursuing a very flexible approach to onsite calibration services. So we've got volume onsite calibration capability where we can go in for two days, three days a month and take care of a customer's complete calibration needs. We've got resident professionals who go onsite and actually do the calibration on the customer site. We've got mobile calibration labs in Europe. We've got local calibration centers all around the world with pick-up and delivery capability. The second part of the strategy is really related to expansion to a multi-vendor capability. And this is really driven by the customers' desire for a one-stop shop. They want somebody who can handle their electrical calibration from a variety of vendors but also cover physical, dimensional and optical and that's really what's behind our too small but very strategic acquisitions we've done in the last year with PSNA about a year ago in the U.S., and Electroservices this past quarter, both very high quality companies, great reputations and offering that multivendor capability which we were lacking. In both cases, we have immediately won larger deals, multiyear, very strong recurring revenue streams. The way this typically works, is you get in, you win one site. And then based on how well you do, you can expand within the customer base. And we've had wins both in the U.S. and Europe and this is primarily in the aerospace, defense environment. So getting to part two of your question, I feel like we're really on track. Again the primary driver to get to that $600 million in fact is going to be the expansion of the calibration play. But as you go in and you do calibration, the very next step would be asset management services. And so, we're aggressively pursuing that in different parts of the world with different capabilities and adding those capabilities into the company. We also believe there's opportunities for us in professional services. And so, those would be layered in on top of the repair and cal business that we have as a core.
Unidentified Analyst: So do you expect any effect on costs going through your fiscal 2016?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. [ph] James, as we think about that, the effort to grow the services business is not necessarily analogous to what we're seeing on the product side. These aren't R&D-driven programs. And so, while there is some investment that is involved, it tends to be smaller in scale than you would typically see on the product side and also it tends to be more directly linked with the revenue opportunities that are there. So you got to have some capacity ahead of demand. But I don't think you should see a material fluctuation in the profitability of this business moving forward based on the investments that are required to grow the business.
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. Thank you. That's helpful. Just one more quick question. Do you have any indication on semiconductor CapEx trends in 2016 given the current soft spending environment?
Neil Dougherty: Guy, I don't know if you have any specific comments?
Guy Séné: This is Guy. No, we don't have specific CapEx numbers different from any of the reports that you get commercially. I think what we look at is really the new technologies. If they're going to go into the sub 20-nanometers and probably sub 15-nanometers pitches that we see happening. And we expect some of this to be happening later in the year that you may know we have a big market share with some of our products in this industry.
Unidentified Analyst: Yeah. Thanks, guys. That's it from me.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Mason with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.
Rob Mason: Yes. Good afternoon, guys.
Neil Dougherty: Hi, Rob.
Rob Mason: I had a couple of clarifications first if I could. Neil, the midpoint of your guidance with core down 1%. What are you assuming for FX and the acquisition contribution in the quarter? I may have missed that if you spoke about it?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. Hang on one minute if you would. Give me one second. I did not break it out. I have those numbers but unfortunately, I don't have them off the top of my head. Do you have a second question while I [indiscernible].
Rob Mason: Yeah. And maybe just another clarification as well. The deferred revenue push-out, or I should say revenue recognition push-out, that you're going to deal with at Anite. Did you incur any of that in the fourth quarter? In other words, push-out some of the revenue recognition?
Neil Dougherty: We did to the tune of about $3 million.
Rob Mason: Okay. And so, the $12 million that we get pushed out, that's for the full - you said that's for the full year next year?
Neil Dougherty: The $12 million is for the full year but it's consolidated in the first half of the year, because essentially you defer revenue but then that deferred revenue gets amortized. And by the second half, the amortization of the revenues that we've deferred in Q4, Q1 and Q2 will have caught up and we will essentially have gotten back to normal.
Rob Mason: Okay. And then just maybe why you're still looking there, if I exclude Anite from your Communications revenue, it looks like maybe the core Communications business was down low double digits. And the reason there is primarily wireless manufacturing it sounds. Do you have any insight - because it sounds like China has stabilized for you but do you have any insight as to maybe how China infrastructure spending will trend into next year - wireless infrastructure?
Neil Dougherty: Guy, if you would you like to comment on that?
Guy Séné: Yeah. Let me comment on China in general. As you have seen, we said that China stabilized and in fact we had a slight cost in Q4. And it's now the fifth quarter where we have seen the stabilization going forward. There is no doubt that one of the delta we got with last year is the fact that we did not see the revenue from the 4G infrastructure build-out as it came down over the year now. Going forward, we're not expecting major investments coming into 4G. We're still looking for the operators like China Telecom, China Unicom that are investing in the this 4G network but we have not seen any material change in investment into infrastructure. So I'm not really counting of this going forward in this year.
Rob Mason: Okay.
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. And on your other question, it's between - sorry, on your other question, the currency impact's between 1% and 2% and the balance is acquisition.
Rob Mason: Okay. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: We have time for one last question. And that question comes from the line of James Covello from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Chelsea Jurman: Hi, this is Chelsea Jurman on behalf of Jim. Thanks for letting me ask a question. With the industry growth being...
Neil Dougherty: Hello.
Chelsea Jurman: Hi - with the industry growth being less than 2% in the beginning of the year and your revenue guidance being up 3% year-over-year at the midpoint, can you just talk about what you think could drive above industry growth for you in the first quarter?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. So in the first quarter I'd just reiterate that our core growth assumption is down 1%. Our total growth assumption is up 3% but that delta is primarily driven by the addition of Anite which obviously wasn't in the year ago numbers.
Chelsea Jurman: Okay, great. Thanks. And then in terms of your comment on aerospace and defense earlier, can you just give a little bit more detail on U.S. government spending and why purchasing didn't come through as you might have expected?
Neil Dougherty: Yeah. Guy, do you want to take that?
Guy Séné: Sure. In fact, two things. One is, in the normal seasonality that we see year-over-year, we in general see a boost of investments coming up in our Q4. Most these orders that where the government is just choosing to budget that they have. This did not happen this year, and you may have seen that in fact, the whole fiscal year, we had unusual seasonality for the budget. So that's really what happened. Looking forward, we're still waiting for the budget to be signed, and we expect that the budget in the U.S. gets signed in the next two weeks. And once this is or will, this will be signed, we should start seeing the orders flow in more in the [indiscernible] Q2.
Chelsea Jurman: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for final comments.
Jason Kary: On behalf of Ron, I'd like to thank everyone for joining the call today. As I mentioned at the top of the call, our strong Q4 performance contributed to a very solid first year as an independent company for Keysight. Our team's operational discipline drove excellent earnings results in Q4 and throughout the year while we completed the separation and closed our first major acquisition in Anite. We also established a consistent track record of meeting our guidance commitments over the past several quarters. So going forward, we will continue to leverage our unique formula of technology leading hardware and software and our large global network of experts to create value for customers and shareholders alike. Our new organizational structure is the next step in driving increased focus on customer solutions and accelerating our growth initiatives in 2016. Thank you very much. And have a nice day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much, Jason and hello, everyone. To start, I have three headlines to share with you regarding Keysight's Q3 results and our recent acquisition. First, despite challenging market conditions, Keysight delivered solid profit and cash flow. This was the sixth quarter in a row that we delivered financial results at or above the midpoint of our revenue and EPS guidance. Second, our strategy to grow in wireless communications and software businesses took a major step forward this quarter when we announced the Anite acquisition and closed it two months ahead of schedule. Third, our fiscal year 2015 guidance reflects our revenue and operating profit overperformance in Q3 and a slightly improved outlook for Q4. Now, let's move to the specifics of Keysight's performance. We had a strong profit performance despite a challenging market environment. Our operating discipline enabled us to perform better than expected in orders, revenue and profit. Q3 orders were down 5%, primarily due to two factors: Greater China and currency. Core orders, without currency and acquisitions, were down 1%, largely due to weakness in Greater China. While this is not desirable, it is a noticeable improvement from the Q2 core order decline of 8%. Q3 revenue, driven by weak orders in the previous quarter, was down 12% or 9% on a core basis. As we anticipated this result, we used our flexible operating model to generate non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was $0.11 above the midpoint of our guidance. Neil will discuss the balance between flexible spending and one-time benefits for future modeling. As this is the sixth quarter in a row that we delivered results above the midpoint of guidance, we feel very good about our operational capabilities as an independent company. Strategically, our focus remains on addressing the customer needs of the faster growing market segments in electronic design and test. Our first area of focus that we outlined over one year ago are realizing solid gains. Wireless communications, modular instrumentation and software solutions. In fact, we accelerated our efforts in both wireless communications and software by announcing in Q3 our intention to acquire Anite. We closed the transaction just last week, two months ahead of schedule. Anite is the leading supplier of test and measurement solutions to help customers develop software and optimize performance in the wireless communications market. This acquisition expands our solutions offering in wireless R&D design and test specifically into the software layer for design and validation. Coupling Keysight's expertise in helping customers design and test hardware, with Anite's leadership in helping the same customers design and test software, we can now provide customers with the most comprehensive wireless solutions for both the hardware and software layers. Anite also has a Network Test business that brings innovative solutions that help deliver an outstanding experience for mobile users in the network. The Network Test business expands Keysight into an adjacent market and increases our overall served addressable market by about $500 million. We are excited to have the talented Anite team join us as they bring a new set of skills, capabilities and opportunities to Keysight. Anite will provide $0.14 to $0.17 of accretion in FY 2016. It will also deliver at least 15% return on invested capital by year five. In addition to Anite's contributions, we continue to make progress on our growth initiatives. In wireless communications, we recently announced 5G collaborations with NTT DOCOMO in Japan, and KT in South Korea, and we joined the mmMAGIC project, a European Commission 5G effort. These early 5G collaborations add to our growing list of engagements with market-making customers, consortia and universities. In modular, Keysight's PXI and AXIe modular business continues to generate very strong growth year-over-year, driven by new products and our success in the Wireless segment. In summary, despite a down revenue quarter, Keysight delivered better profitability than expected in Q3, and we see a slightly improved outlook for Q4. This contributes directly to our full year guidance in which revenues are expected to be in the range of $2.84 billion to $2.88 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.52. At this point, I will turn the call over to Neil to provide details of Keysight's financials.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Keysight had solid profit performance in a quarter where seasonally soft revenue was compounded by the impact of our weak Q2 orders. The order picture improved in Q3 with orders down 1% on a core basis versus a core decline of 8% last quarter. We actually saw core order growth in all regions with the exception of Greater China and had a book-to-bill ratio above 1. Third quarter revenues of $665 million were down 12% year-over-year, or down 9% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions. The regional breakdown of revenue was in line with prior periods, with 37% of revenues coming from the Americas, 18% from Europe and 45% from Asia. On a core basis, revenue was down 11% in the Americas, down 5% in Europe, down 14% in Asia excluding Japan, and up 14% in Japan. China revenues were down double-digits in Q3 versus a particularly strong compare. Despite the softer top-line, profit performance for the quarter was solid with Q3 operating margin of 18.6%. After applying our 17% non-GAAP tax rate, we generated non-GAAP net income of $94 million or $0.55 per share. We did benefit from $5 million in one-time items this quarter, which improved our operating margin by 75 basis points and our EPS by $0.03. Even after adjusting for these favorable benefits, our profit performance illustrates the strength and flexibility of our operating model. Gross margins improved 110 basis points versus last year on much lower revenue. Among the drivers of this improvement was a higher mix of sales to R&D versus manufacturing customers and disciplined pricing management. Expenses were well controlled during the quarter as our flexible business model enabled us to manage our cost structure in response to business conditions. Currency continued to provide a significant revenue headwind in the third quarter, reducing the top-line by four percentage points. Despite this impact, exchange rate movements had no material impact on our Q3 earnings, as the unfavorable impact on revenue was offset by a favorable impact on expenses. Now, turning to cash flow, in Q3 Keysight generated cash from operations of $135 million and had $35 million of capital expenditures. This resulted in $100 million of free cash flow. We finished Q3 with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion and total debt of $1.1 billion, for a net debt position of approximately $100 million. However, as Ron mentioned, after quarter end, we closed the all-cash acquisition of Anite for a purchase price of approximately $600 million, materially reducing our cash balance. Moving to the results of our two operating segments. Measurement Solutions generated third quarter revenue of $564 million, down 11% on a core basis, with an operating margin of 18.4%. The Customer Support and Services segment generated revenue of $101 million, up 4% on a core basis, with an operating margin of 19.4%. Now, turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. End markets appear to have stabilized, and we expect Q4 to be seasonally stronger than Q3, in line with historical norms. Including the impact of the Anite acquisition, we expect Q4 revenues to be in the range of $735 million to $775 million, and non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.57 to $0.71. At the midpoint, this reflects a core year-over-year revenue decline of 2%, which excludes a four percentage point unfavorable impact from currency and five points of inorganic growth from the Anite acquisition. Now, looking at our expectations for the full fiscal year, the midpoint of our Q4 guidance implies FY 2015 revenue of $2.86 billion, which is flat on a core basis; and FY 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.45. In summary, our operating profit performance in our first year as an independent company has been strong. We launched Keysight, completed the separation and stabilized our operations. We accomplished all this without disrupting our customer relationships, while generating strong profit, increasing our investments to drive future growth and initiating our post-separation optimization efforts. Looking forward to FY 2016, we currently expect the electronic design and test market to grow at a rate of approximately 2%. We're excited to have closed the acquisition of Anite as the addition of their product portfolio and the expansion of our markets supports our strategy to grow in wireless communications and software. We expect Anite to be accretive to our FY 2016 non-GAAP earnings by $0.14 to $0.17 and have already begun to implement our integration plan. This plan will result in $20 million of run rate cost synergies by the end of year two and enable us to generate a 15% return on invested capital within five years. It is important to note that Anite's revenue and profit are highly seasonal. In Anite's fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, 60% of their annual revenue and 77% of their annual profit was generated in their second half. Keysight's business also follows a seasonal pattern with our first and third quarters typically having lower revenue and our second and fourth quarters being seasonally stronger. As you look beyond the coming quarter, recall that in addition to this revenue seasonality, expenses are typically higher in our fiscal first quarter impacting Q1 profitability. Finally, you will notice a new line item on our income statement this quarter, other operating income and expense. We have determined that certain income and expense items, primarily rental income, are more appropriately classified within our operating results. We have, therefore, moved them from other income and expense to the new line, other operating income and expense. This is purely a reclassification and has no net impact on our business. As a final note, we will be discussing our longer-term strategy at our upcoming Investor Day which is planned for September 1 in New York City. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A.
Jason A. Kary - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President: Thank you, Neil. Mike, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A?
Operator: And the first question is from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I have couple questions on Anite, if I may. One is did I hear you correctly that there's four points of growth embedded in the outlook for the acquisition in your fiscal fourth quarter?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Sorry, in the fourth quarter, it's five points of growth.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Five points of growth. Okay.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yes.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And then how should we think about the $20 million in cost savings? You talked about it layering in over the next 24 months, but when you provided your $0.14 to $0.17 of accretion, how much of that $20 million is built into fiscal year 2016?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah, the – as we look at our integration plan, not surprisingly, there are a few things that kind of you get quick wins, but then a large portion of the integration plan takes time. Our focus with the integration is really on making sure that we continue to generate the growth that Anite has generated over the past year and we want to continue that trend. So there's a relatively small portion of those synergies will be realized within FY 2016. That $20 million will be really the run rate that we will achieve two years from now.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess where exactly are those cost savings going to be coming from, Neil?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Not surprisingly there are opportunities kind of up and down the P&L. Typically, we will do our best to eliminate duplicate costs, but you will see cost savings in the admin functions as well as in gross margins as well.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about your appetite for M&A post this acquisition, I think you said in your prepared remarks that this was obviously a $600 million purchase, so quite substantial, but you did generate $100 million of free cash flow in the quarter. So if you could touch on the appetite for M&A and then also, Neil, if you could remind us the mix of domestic and international cash post the transaction.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'll let Neil talk about the cash position, but our appetite is strong. We're looking to grow and have the absolute strongest portfolio in the wireless communications market, the aerospace and defense market and the industrial markets. So we're looking and we will continue to look for strategic acquisitions. The one thing that I want to make sure is that we integrate any acquisition effectively. We deliver on the synergies and deliver on the return on invested capital. So that's our first priority and after that and once we are convinced that we could do that and take on another significant acquisition, we will follow up. But at this point, we're not willing to give a timeframe until we see progress on the Anite acquisition.
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: And then with regard to the split of our onshore and offshore cash generation, I think the important things to note there is the $600 million purchase of Anite was entirely with offshore cash so that would be a reduction from our offshore cash balance. And then going forward, we generate cash – our cash is generated approximately 75% offshore and 25% onshore.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So that mix is heavier onshore then, currently post the $600 million purchase?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. The ratio, obviously, shifts significantly towards the U.S. but we don't have a large U.S. cash balance. I don't have the number in front of me right now, but it's between $100 million and $200 million is the rough number.
Patrick M. Newton - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you. I'll jump back in queue.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patrick.
Operator: We have time for one last question and the question comes from the line of Richard Eastman with Robert W. Baird.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Yeah. So let me ask a couple of questions here. One, Ron, can you just talk to orders the seasonal or sequential strength in orders. Where did that come from? I mean it looks quite good and there was some reference to the fourth quarter looking slightly better, so maybe you could just kind of dive into that order number and why seasonally where the strength was.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I'll let Guy give you some color commentary, but as we mentioned, our core orders were down only 1%. All regions were up with the exception of Greater China. So that gives us a very good perspective and that's a substantial improvement from what we had seen in Q2. And Guy, I think you may want to give some more comments.
Guy Séné - SVP-Measurement Solutions & Worldwide Sales: Yes, of course. Richard, when you look at the adjusted for currency in orders, mainly this was driven by a stronger wireless R&D, we also had some good business in the components and the semiconductor. We had, for instance, won some large design deals mainly with our high-speed digital solutions there. Europe was up also on strong semiconductor and manufacturing test. We had some good aerospace defense deals, and obviously, we have easier compare now for Russia. And Japan continues to see steady investments in device component manufacturing and we also had some nice investments for 4G wireless in R&D for them. So again, as Ron was saying, all regions except Greater China were positive in all of those.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And China, and just continue on China, is that all reflected in this communications decline of 20%? And are we still kind of held up on or paused on 4G deployment? What's – why is – yeah?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. China has been roughly flat for us for the last four quarters with very strong compares versus the four quarters below that. But what we've seen is that business level out roughly in the $130 million per quarter range with regard to orders and revenues. So the declines, we haven't seen them much since then in the last four quarters, as we've been pretty flat. Most of that is in wireless communications, but they also do have an Aerospace Defense business that we sell into. We do not sell the highest-performance products which are basically only allowed to be sold to certain countries, but for the generalized Aerospace Defense business, that also plays into China.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And then – and your reference to down or flat the last four quarters, this would be the last quarter then of being "down 20%" against the tough comps? Is that what you're implying so the next quarter becomes an easier comp?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: That's correct.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then also, Ron, you have made a comment about – just trying to find it here, but electronic design being up 2% next year. I think the reference was to 2016. Yeah, electronic design would grow 2%. Was that reference to Anite's growth rate specifically?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: No. No.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Neil had made that comment, and that's for the electronic design and test market that we play in. We've seen that market grow typically 3% to 4% when we look on a longer-term basis, but given where it is now, we see the market growing roughly 2% next year.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): And that leaves out the portion of your business that would be more production test?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, that's the overall market that we're talking about which is roughly the $12.5 billion for the addressable market that we have.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I understand. So that's the benchmark for your core growth rate and we plan to do better than that? Yeah. We...
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Absolutely.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No doubt. And for our growth rate, obviously, we have been doing pretty well in keeping up on a core basis during this last year and even at the end of the year before and then we have Anite on top of that on an inorganic basis.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then just a last question. I just – one of the things that I think that you had mentioned, Ron, coming out of the fiscal second quarter, was just some concern around currency, had not seen any pricing pressure related to currency, related to the dollar and the competition. Obviously, nothing is showing up in your gross margins. But how do you feel about that situation, especially with the – potentially some devaluations of the renminbi?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, the biggest issue is Rohde & Schwarz is a competitor that is based out of Germany and they may have a little bit more ability to price more competitively, but we've had a very active program during the last year to reduce our discounts and that has paid off well and that has been a contributing factor to our gross margin improvement, that continued through last quarter. So we will keep an eye on it, make sure that we're competitive with our non-U.S. competitors, but so far so good and that's why we really have gone to work on discounts, on cost improvements, on product models and as well as moving our mix, less from manufacturing to more into R&D which as we reported before, the last time we reported publicly is over 50%. And as we move Anite into our numbers, that will increase that percentage even further as they are more strongly biased towards research and development.
Richard C. Eastman - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. I understand. And congrats on Anite, it looks like a good fit. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you very much, Rick.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Thanks. Good afternoon. Neil, just back to that last question on the market growth, do you have an estimate for what your $12 billion TAM, what the market did or will do in 2015?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I'll take that question. This year I mean you can look at all the competitors and seeing what's happened during the last 12 months. We see it roughly flat, now again, when you look at the public numbers that exist for the public competitors, we look at the test and measurement portion of Danaher, we look at the test and measurement portion, for instance, of Anritsu, don't look at their total numbers, but look at the markets that we play in. And then we use a third-party source when available to try to fill in some of the smaller competitors. But during the last 12 months, it's been roughly flat.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. Then, Neil, you alluded to some one-time benefits on the margins in the third quarter, what were those attributable to? And as far as the Anite accretion goes for next year, are you absorbing any – are there any upfront one-time costs or expenses that are embedded in that accretion expectation?
Neil P. Dougherty - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President: Yeah. So first of all, with regard to the one-time benefits that we saw here in the third quarter, we do an annual true-up of our U.S. benefit costs. It's essentially we accrue expenses based on actuarial estimates, as there were things like workman's comp, disability and medical and then we do a true-up once a year to essentially reconcile between the rate at which we were accruing and actual experience – and our actual experience over the course of the last 12 months was favorable relative to the rate at which we had been accruing. That's not something that you can count on going forward. It only takes one or two events to flip that the other way. So we believe we accrue over the long-term at the right rate, we just had a little bit of good luck over the course of the last 12 months. And then with regard to your question about the costs associated with Anite and delivering those synergies, if you review the 2.7 document, we do talk about kind of integration cost – total integration costs including both the costs necessary to generate those cost synergies as well as some potential IP transactions totaling $100 million. That was what was shared in the original transaction documents. We now believe that, that number would max out at $80 million again and that would be really over the course of the first couple of years you'd see those things – that, that money's spent.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. And then last one, Ron, you alluded to a slightly improved 4Q outlook. What changed relative to your initial expectation? What are you more optimistic about in particular?
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It's really the forecast, we do a bottoms-up forecast in our sales organization; we do a bottoms-up forecast in each of the divisions that are out working with customers on big deals. We look at the size of our funnel and we look at our direct channel as well as the funnels from some of the business that we've converted from indirect in the U.S. to direct, and all of those come together in a forecast and where we're glad that we've seen an increase in that forecast going forward. As you know, we also build backlog in Q3, which was very nice.
S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC: Super. Thank you.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary.
Jason A. Kary - Treasurer, Investor Relations & Vice President: Thank you, Mike. I'm actually going to turn it over to Ron for your final comments.
Ronald S. Nersesian - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. While market conditions remain relatively soft, we've delivered to our operating model as well as focused on transforming our company to grow. We will continue to leverage our unique formula of technology-leading hardware and software and our large global network of experts to create value for customers and shareholders. In closing, I remind you that our inaugural Keysight Investor and Analyst Meeting is on September 1 in New York City. We look forward to sharing more details of our long-term plan for value creation and providing you a better understanding of Keysight's strengths and market opportunities. I hope you can join us. Thank you very much, and have a nice day.
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q2  (2015-05-19 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kelly, and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 19, 2015, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.
 I would now like to hand the conference over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call for Fiscal Year 2015. With me are Ron Nersesian, Keysight President and CEO; and Neil Dougherty, Keysight's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Neil's comments will be Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of Measurement Solutions and Worldwide Sales; and Mike Gasparian, Senior Vice President of Customer Support  Services and Marketing.
 You can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.keysight.com. While there, please click on the link for Quarterly Reports under the Financial Information tab. There, you will find an investor presentation, along with Keysight's segment results. We will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call.
 Today's comments by Ron and Neil will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please review the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors.
 And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron. 
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you very much, Jason, and hello, everyone. I will start by sharing 4 headlines regarding Keysight's Q2 results. First, our second quarter revenue of $740 million was at the midpoint of our guidance, and our non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.70 was at the high end of our guidance range. We executed well in our second quarter as an independent company, and this is the fifth quarter in a row that we've delivered financial results at or above expectations. Second, incoming orders declined versus a strong quarter last year. Third, in light of slower incoming orders, we have initiated programs in Q2 to reduce our cost structure by $25 million over the next 24 months. And fourth, with the end of our IT support agreement with Agilent in Q2, we have completed the final steps of our separation. With that last separation milestone behind us, our focus now is entirely on delivering value through growth and improving our operational efficiency as an independent company.
 Now let's move on to the specifics of our results. Second quarter revenue of $740 million were flat over last year, up 3% on a core basis and were at the midpoint of our guidance. Operating profit for the quarter was 20.3%. The business generated operating profit of $150 million and non-GAAP earnings of $0.70 per share. From an end-market perspective, total aerospace/defense revenues declined 1% year-over-year, with strength in the U.S. offset by weakness in the rest of the world. Stable budgets and ongoing program technology investment drove aerospace/defense spending in the U.S. from both direct government accounts and contractors. Outside of the U.S., aerospace/defense revenues were down. Europe and Russia remained weak, while Asia slowed on lighter spending in China. Industrial computers and semiconductor revenues grew 2% year-over-year. Our broader general industrial markets have improved this quarter, while computer and semiconductor markets held up better than expected. Communications revenues declined 3% year-over-year in Q2, driven by lower wireless manufacturing spending. As we expected, last year's strength in 4G base station and infrastructure manufacturing for China has moderated. In addition, capacity expansion for smartphone and smart device manufacturing remains fairly limited. We continue to see steady investment by chipset, device chipset and component customers. Wireless R&D revenues were steady this quarter and continue to track with our expectations of stable investment levels, especially from wireless chipset customers. From a regional perspective, revenue growth was strong in the Americas and grew in all regions, except for Asia Pacific, excluding Japan. Americas grew 19% year-over-year, driven by strength in aerospace/defense and industrial computers and semiconductor market segments. Asia-Pacific revenues, excluding Japan, declined 14% year-over-year versus a strong compare with declines in all market segments. Europe grew 4% on a core basis as strength in computers and semiconductors spending offset weaknesses in Russia. Japan rebounded strongly from a weak Q1 and grew 13% on a core basis with strength in wireless components spending.
 While we are pleased with our financial results and execution this quarter, our incoming order rate was weaker than expected. Q2 orders of $697 million decreased 11% year-over-year, a decline of 8% on a core basis. Russia accounted for 2 points of the overall order decline due to ongoing sanctions and its economic situation. The balance of the decline was due to capacity build orders placed by 2 large semiconductor and communications customers in our second quarter last year that did not repeat.
 As we look to the remainder of the year, the weakness in communications is partially being offset by strength in aerospace/defense. There are positive and negative across the industrial computers and semiconductor end markets and overall macroeconomic indicators remain mixed. Accordingly, we initiated several programs that will provide $25 million in total in operational savings that not only offset the dis-synergies associated with our spin off, but also will ensure that our investments are more focused on growth generation through R&D and sales efforts.
 Coupling this focus with the discipline and strength of our operating model allows us to maintain our investment across the cycle and still deliver solid profitability and cash flow. Therefore, we will continue to invest for the future in 3 key areas that we have highlighted before: wireless communications, modular solutions and software. For instance, carrier aggregation is a key to increasing bandwidth and data rates to create better mobile communications experience for consumers. In Q2, Keysight and Spirent announced a partnership to offer the most advanced carrier-acceptance solution available for testing maximum data throughput performance for LTE-advanced carrier aggregation. The solution was created by integrating our R&D one-box tester platform, the UXM, into Spirent's new carrier acceptance and conformance test solutions.
 Our modular business had another record revenue quarter, and continued to grow at high double-digit rates. We believe this trend will continue as we leverage state-of-the-art technology from our instrument solutions to deliver unparalleled combinations of measurement performance, speed, size and cost of test for customers. A good example of Keysight solution incorporating multiple hardware and software elements is the 5G solution that we previewed at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain in March. The solution is for a complex task that is crucial in early-stage R&D to assess performance of proposed 5G network designs.  
 As I mentioned as one of the headlines for this call, we took the final steps in our separation from Agilent with the end of our IT support agreement. With this important milestone behind us, our focus is entirely on delivering value through innovative electronic design and test solutions as well as improving our operational efficiency as an independent company.
 I will now turn the call over to Neil to provide the details of Keysight's financial results and guidance for our third quarter. 
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. Before I review the details of our second quarter, please note that my comments refer to non-GAAP results. You can find reconciliations to the nearest GAAP figures on our Investors Relations website.
 Turning to our results for Q2. Second quarter revenue of $740 million was flat year-over-year, or up 3% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions. The impact of acquisitions was immaterial, though currency accounted for the full 3 percentage point headwind versus Q2 of FY '14. Operating margin for the quarter was 20.3%, down 80 basis points versus the same period last year, as a result of our incremental investment in R&D.
 The regional breakdown of our revenue was in line with prior periods, with 38% of revenues coming from the Americas, 17% from Europe and 45% from Asia. On a core basis, revenue grew 19% in the Americas, 4% in Europe and 13% in Japan. Asia, excluding Japan, declined 14%. Lower revenue from Russia continued to be a drag on growth. Russia orders and revenue were both down significantly, and we do not expect any improvement in the near term.
 Moving to the income statement. Currency movements had no material impact on our Q2 operating profit as the unfavorable impact on revenue was offset by favorability in expenses. Gross margins improved 50 basis points versus last year on a similar revenue base due to a higher mix of revenue from R&D versus manufacturing applications and lower warranty expense. Expenses were well controlled, and we continue to invest in R&D at a rate of 13% of revenue.
 As mentioned, non-GAAP operating margins were just over 20% for the quarter at 20.3% of revenue. After applying our 17% non-GAAP tax rate, we generated non-GAAP net income of $120 million or $0.70 per share.
 Now turning to cash flow. In Q2, Keysight generated cash from operations of $68 million and invested $16 million in capital expenditures, resulting in 15 -- $52 million of free cash flow. With cash and cash equivalents of $894 million and total debt of $1.1 billion, we finished the quarter in a net debt position of $205 million.
 Moving to the results of our 2 operating segments. Measurement Solutions generated revenue of $638 million with an operating margin of 20.7% in the second quarter. Segment revenue grew 3% on a core basis, while operating margin improved 20 basis points year-over-year. The Customer Support and Services segment generated revenue of $102 million, a core increase of 3%. After adjusting for the impact of the March 2013 change to our standard warranty period from 1 to 3 years, segment revenue grew 11%. Second quarter operating margin for the Customer Support and Services segment was 17.7%, a sequential improvement of 400 basis points. We are already seeing the benefit of the incremental investments in technology and capacity that we began last quarter.
 Now turning to our outlook for the third quarter. You should note that Q2 and Q4 are typically stronger quarters for the business, while Q1 and Q3 are seasonally softer.  Last year, revenue did grow sequentially from Q2 to Q3, but that deviation from historical norms was the result of a weak first half and an increase in Aerospace & Defense spending post sequestration. We expect to return to our typical seasonality this year, and given our Q2 orders, we are guiding revenues in the range of $635 million to $675 million. This represents a core decline of 10% at the midpoint. We expect third quarter non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.51. Our guidance assumes the exchange rates as of April 30 and the share count of 172 million shares. Our revenue guidance does represent a lower point in our operating model, however, the flexibility of our cost structure will enable us to maintain Q3 operating margin in the mid-teens. In addition to the flexible spending reductions already made, and which are fundamental to our operating model, we have also initiated programs to generate $25 million in structural savings over the next 24 months. These programs will improve our operational efficiency and accelerate the transformation of our company. Two examples of structural actions we have taken include the announcement of a voluntary retirement program and the closure of our U.S.-defined benefit plan to new entrants. These cost-reduction initiatives, in conjunction with our operating model discipline, will enable us to continue making the investments necessary for Keysight to return to market growth while delivering strong profitability and cash flow across the cycle. 
 As a final note, we will be discussing our longer-term strategy and market outlook at our upcoming Investor Day, which is planned for September 1 in New York. 
 With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A? 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. 
S. Brandon Couillard: Ron, in terms of the 2Q experience and the 3Q guidance, particularly within Communications, could you speak to which markets in particular were weakest, and how the pacing was through the second quarter? And if you could shed some light around what the Communications orders were in the second quarter would be helpful. 
Ronald Nersesian: I'll make some general comments, and I'll let Guy fill in and provide some more color or commentary. Wireless manufacturing was the weakest segment, by far, and that's where we saw the largest hit. The wireless R&D segment was in the middle, and we actually saw growth in other communication, which includes our optical business or our fiber business that talks more about wireless infrastructure, infrastructure for wireless systems. But the biggest hit that we saw was, in particular, in the overall wireless manufacturing phase. We had mentioned 2 deals in particular that had pulled down our average. One of them pulled down our weighted average core growth 4 points alone. That was for a large deal for near-field communication that we won last year, and we received a significantly large order. That was a one-time shot last year in Q2. Our strategy is to migrate more and more of our portfolio over to R&D and to have a higher percentage of the portfolio in software and recurring revenue through services, software and other products. So we're looking over time to be able to mitigate these manufacturing swings. Guy, anything else to add? 
Guy Séné: No, I think you mentioned all the points. 
S. Brandon Couillard: Just one more follow-up, I guess for Neil, in terms of the cost-savings plan. Could you elaborate or give us any color on the phasing of that $25 million over the 2-year period? Curious as to why it's such a protracted period of time. And then, in which areas of the business in particular, product lines? There should be lines in the P&L. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So I mean, let me touch on that. So first of all, there's kind of 2 efforts that are underway. The short term with the flexibility of our cost structure where we've already began executing our playbook around the short-term flexibility in Q2 when we saw the incoming order rate, and we're accounting on real savings in Q3 to allow us to maintain the profitability in FY '13 -- excuse me, in Q3, in the mid-teens. And so that's a combination of structural things like the fact that a large portion of our -- or significant portion of our sales go through a flexible indirect channel. That we outsource portions of our -- significant portions of our supply chain. And that 100% of our employee base has a portion of their pay that fluctuates with the overall business performance. In addition to that, we are reducing discretionary spending essentially up and down the P&L, with the exception of 2 areas, R& D and field spending, where we're essentially keeping the foot on the gas to make sure we continue to generate orders in the short term and drive growth over the longer term. So that's -- those are the immediate efforts that are going underway. Then in addition to that, we've taken some actions to drive more structural cost savings. Again, we quantified it at $25 million. We do believe it'll take us $24 million -- 24 months to realize the full $25 million in savings. And really, what you're looking at is a number of different programs that will all be running in parallel that will generate savings over time. So I've mentioned 2 of them. One is a voluntary early retirement program. We have a significant portion of our population that's retirement eligible. Obviously, these are employees that have been with us for a long time. They have a lot of institutional knowledge, and what we really want to be able to do is to plan our workforce transition better. And so we will provide them with a bonus to commit to a retirement date, that it will allow us to do some knowledge transfer and then ultimately result in some savings. But it's not the type of thing that turns on overnight, because, again, a big component of that is to understand when they are going to retire and do that knowledge transfer. I also mentioned the termination of our defined benefit plan in the U.S. to new entrants. That will provide savings over the long term, but relatively limited savings in the first year because you need to get a critical mass of people that are on the new program to generate material savings. Another big area of focus is in when you look at what we've essentially just been through as a company, we just spun out from Agilent and, by and large, the process that was followed was to replicate Agilent's processes for Keysight. As Ron has mentioned, we have completed that separation process during the second quarter, and now we're changing our focus towards optimization of those processes. So we now need to look at those processes that were replicated and reengineer them, and that requires some investment, and will take some time for us to realize the savings. So it's going to be a series of different programs that will result in that $25 million savings, and some of it will be realized sooner, and -- but will take us the full 24 months to get it all. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. 
Richard Eastman: Ron, could you just kind of spend a minute more just on the orders. And when you talk about the orders geographically, I presume down to 8% in local currency is kind of the number I'm zeroing in on. But is most of the softness, when you speak about geographic orders, is most of that then in Asia, Asia Pac, ex-Japan? Or could you just kind of speak to how orders in the Americas and Europe was, and maybe if there was any strength in any of the application areas? 
Guy Séné: This is Guy. We definitely have seen a mixed picture across the different regions in terms of orders, and the U.S., the Americas were stronger than the rest of the world. We've had obviously quite some currency impact in Europe where the currency impact had a 10% impact on our total. And Russia is a place where we continue to see ongoing structural weakness due to the situation with the sanctions and the ruble. So Russia has impacted significantly some of the orders we have seen in Europe. Asia, in general, declined on all sectors for revenue, as you heard from Ron. But also the key orders that we mentioned in semiconductor and wireless were coming from Asia, and made Asia then being the place where the orders declined the most. In general, we've seen in Japan, in fact, more flat and going up if we include the currency impact that was still very important in Japan. We have a 13% currency impact in Japan. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. And then just 2 questions maybe for Neil. Could you just talk for a second, within the Customer Support and Services, what's the impact of the deferred revenue or the warranty period pushing that out? As we approach the second half, will some of that annualize? Will we start to see some growth there in revenue? Or is it largely going to stay flattish until we get well into fiscal '16? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so we essentially have a $28 million per year headwind that goes from essentially the bleeding off of this deferred revenues that was associated with the extended warranty sales. That ends in Q1 -- will materially end in Q1 of FY '16, at which point -- so right now, we're kind of -- we need to generate that $20 million of growth just to tread water, basically. Beginning in FY '16, the compares will essentially get easier, but it will take a year before you start to see meaningful growth because of the bleed off of that deferred revenue. 
Richard Eastman: And is the growth there -- Ron, is the growth there coming on the repair and calibration side? Or again, I know you flush -- you run some of your used inventory equipment through that, but where exactly is the growth? Is it in an attachment rate issue that we're focusing on or...? 
Michael Gasparian: This is Mike Gasparian. Let me make a couple of comments about that. Our revenue growth during the quarter for the CSS segment came from a number of factors. The first was our remarketing division, which is, in fact, that Keysight premium used equipment. That value proposition has been very well received internationally, so we're seeing good growth internationally for our used equipment. We're also -- we typically see strong used equipment sales when we have a mixed economic picture or a weaker economic picture. So a number of our major accounts took advantage of our used equipment, which, by the way, does come with a 3-year warranty associated with it. Also in the more traditional service and repair area, this overhang that Neil was referring to was associated with deferred revenue, also, we will be taking a hit until Q2 of fiscal year '16 related to repair and parts because we have another 2 years of repair and parts that are covered under warranty, so we won't see any repair revenue until then. So the repair parts and deferred revenue will all be weak until the beginning of '16. We're seeing really nice growth, however, in our aerospace/defense segment, where we've been pursuing a multi-vendor strategy that's most prevalent in the United States and Europe. So that's providing a really good offset to the declines that Neil commented on. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. And just one last question on -- to you here. But when I look at the guidance for the third quarter at midpoint, so revenue, EPS and walk-up to the EBIT line, it looks like at midpoint, maybe the decremental is approaching 65% sequentially. That seems a bit high. Any thoughts there? Is it just a mix issue or...? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes. So -- well, as you know, the decremental is tough. This is really a reset year for Keysight, given the -- essentially that the business is fundamentally different as an independent company than it was as part of Agilent. So you need to layer in the synergies, which are material. You need to layer in the incremental investment in R&D that we are making. And so there -- it's really hard to do those year-over-year incremental/decremental compares given fundamental changes that we've been through. 
Richard Eastman: That's actually -- that's the sequential math from second to third. 
Neil Dougherty: Are you looking at -- I'm sorry, I always do my incremental/decrementals year-over-year, so I haven't even done that sequential incremental/decremental look. Obviously, we see a big drop off in revenue. Our ability to -- we are taking action to reduce discretionary spending and minimize the impact. But the actual variable cost of sales on the lost dollar of revenue in the very short run is very significant. 
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Newton from Stifel. 
Patrick Newton: I guess, kind of a multi-part question for Neil or Ron on FX. One is, I want to make sure the negative impact was you said was 3% to revenue in the April quarter. I think I'm calc-ing about a 2% negative impact embedded in the July outlook, if you could confirm that. And then on a competitive basis, given that 2 of your largest competitors are domiciled in Germany and Japan, are you seeing any change to market or pricing dynamics? And do you think that this competitive benefit to your competitors is perhaps impacting the orders for or the Communications business? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, could you repeat the first part of your question about the July outlook? I'm sorry, I missed the first part of that. 
Patrick Newton: I think I'm calc-ing that there's about a negative 2% FX headwind year-over-year embedded in the July quarter outlook, I want to make sure that was accurate. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, no, 3% is what we've modeled. 
Ronald Nersesian: 3% in Q2, 3% in Q3. 
Neil Dougherty: That's right. 
Ronald Nersesian: And the second issue, there's no doubt -- we haven't seen it from Japan, but there's no doubt that we're very competitive with Rohde & Schwarz, our #1 competitor in the RF and microwave wireless world, and we expect there to be some pretty aggressive actions from the competition on the pricing side. That's why we've been working all the cost improvement programs that we work on a continuous basis in the order fulfillment organization, and that's built into our guidance. 
Patrick Newton: Okay, and then I guess as a follow-up. The -- on the Communications side, given that softness, I would assume that the industry growth target, given what peers have said, as well -- is no longer 2.5% to 3.5% in '15 at this point. So do you anticipate that the industry will grow in 2015? And I guess, if -- 2015, no matter what, looks like the fourth consecutive year of a lethargic or no growth environment for both Keysight and the broader industry. Do you see any fundamental changes on the horizon that could spur growth? Or do you see the industry structurally being in a low-growth phase? 
Ronald Nersesian: I think, right now, I don't see any instantaneous inflections in the business. There is no doubt that there is still more 4G build out to happen. Obviously, there was a big push last year, and there's a little bit of a pause now. But that will continue for years to come. And we're at the early stages of 5G investment, where we're starting to see that in early R&D and everybody to be concerned, so that will help. But there is continuous cost pressure, and we have had -- we have seen margins erode in manufacturing. And that's why we're so determined to shift a higher percentage of our resources in R&D towards winning in our -- our resources to winning in R&D versus winning in production where the margins are much stronger. 
Patrick Newton: And can you -- just dovetailing off that answer, what is the relative size of your production business in Communications versus R&D? I think you said R&D was greater than half last quarter, that may have been for the overall company, but I think that is also true for Communications. Because I'm just -- I think that's a little bit surprising that you're citing that for weakness just in the sense that it was already sub-15, it's been an area that's been pressured for several quarters in a row. 
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. Well, it was down. There were some large manufacturing builds last year. Matter fact, I think our growth last year was 11% in Q2. And accordingly, we had some big wins as people put in near-field communication. We also saw some people shift their semiconductor providers in another sector, and that created some large buys last year. Both of these are to the tune of almost 2 $30 million orders that didn't repeat. So that was $60 million of the decline alone were those 2 orders, which make up almost 8 points of core growth. But we'll continue to see pressure in that area, but that's why we continue to shift towards more software and more R&D solutions as we move forward. 
Operator: We have time for one last question, and the question comes from the line of Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs. 
Chelsea Jurman: This is Chelsea Jurman on behalf of Jim. So gross margin came in a lot stronger than we expected in the current quarter. Can you just talk about the different drivers of the stronger gross margin, and what you're expecting for next quarter? 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, in terms of the drivers of gross margin, as Ron has mentioned, we're working to transition more and more of our business to R&D versus manufacturing. That tends to drive gross margins, obviously, as we are on the higher end of technology, gross margins tend to be higher at the cutting edge of technology versus products that are older. And as the technology evolves, what you tend to see is pricing falls and gross margin falls on older products and you get replaced with newer products at the cutting edge of technology that drives gross margin. 
Chelsea Jurman: And for next quarter? 
Neil Dougherty: For next quarter, the biggest -- I mean, the biggest driver is volume, right? Obviously, we're going to see a significant drop off in volume sequentially. And given the product, given the fixed cost infrastructure, that's going to be the biggest driver sequentially. 
Ronald Nersesian: I'll just make some 3 general comments, or give you 3 different insights as far as what drives it in general. One is, we have a material cost-savings program that we continuously work on to get. The second is the logistic savings. We've been driving those costs down. And the third point is mix. So for instance, when you have a large $30 million order, you can imagine the discount rate on that would be very high. So when you do a comparative, and you don't get that order to repeat, you can imagine the gross margin going up when you're not giving that large discount on a weighted-average basis. And that is one example basically on the mix of large orders versus small orders. But it also happens by different product lines, since we have hundreds and hundreds of product lines that are substantial to our revenue line. 
Chelsea Jurman: Great. Thanks, that's really helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you give us any update on what you're thinking in terms of capital allocation, and whether you have any sort of preference for a buyback versus a dividend or M&A when you do begin to allocate capital? 
Ronald Nersesian: Yes. Our first objective, as you can see, I mean, our ROIC this quarter was 39%. You see where our operating model is and what type of returns we provide. But if you really step back and look at Keysight as an independent entity, what we've done in the past is generate a lot of cash, but use that cash to help the Life Sciences business of Agilent grow. And we really need to focus on growth and make sure that we grow and increase our lead as the #1 test and measurement provider. So growth is our first priority. That's why we've talked about increasing our revenue to 13%, still a little bit below industry average, but making a small move there. And we did adjust it, obviously, with the top line being down, so it's 13% of the new number. But we're also looking inorganically at what place makes sense. We do want to make sure that we get a good return above the cost of capital and that it fits strategically within our business. So growth will be our first priority, while providing investors a return on an ROIC above the cost of capital. After that, if we do not have any other good ideas, we will look to returning capital to our shareholders. But at this point, as you look at the history over the last 10-plus years for Keysight as an entity within Agilent, growth is the issue that we think will generate the best long-term shareholder value. Longer term, down the road, we're going to be -- we will be looking at share buybacks and dividends as part of our mix. There is no doubt. 
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jason Kary for any final comments. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, operator. Actually, I'll turn it over to Ron and -- for your final comments. 
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, all, for joining our call. I'm pleased that Keysight delivered another quarter of solid earnings. In addition, we initiated actions to reduce our cost structure by $25 million to adjust to the current dynamics of the industry, to deliver current -- to deliver double-digit profits through the cycle and to maintain our momentum in developing industry-leading solutions. In closing, I'll remind you that our unique formula of combining technology-leading hardware and software and our global network of experts, we are committed to maintaining the discipline of our operating model while investing to grow and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you very much, and have a nice day. 
Operator: This concludes our conference call. You may now disconnect.

===== 2015 Q1  (2015-02-19 00:00:00) =====
Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Keysight Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mike, and I will be your lead operator today. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 19, 2015, at 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time. 
 I would now like to hand the conference over to Jason Kary, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Kary. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, Mike, and welcome, everyone, to Keysight’s first quarter earnings conference call for fiscal year 2015. With me are Ron Nersesian, Keysight President and CEO; and Neil Dougherty, Keysight's Senior Vice President and CFO. Joining in the Q&A after Neil's comments will be Guy Séné, Senior Vice President of Measurement Solutions and Worldwide Sales; and Mike Gasparian, Senior Vice President of Customer Support, Services and Marketing. 
 You can find the press release and information to supplement today's discussion on our website at investor.keysight.com. While there, please click on the link for Quarterly Reports under the Financial Information tab. There you will find an investor presentation and we will also post a copy of the prepared remarks following this call.  
 Today's comments by Ron and Neil will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. You will find the most directly comparable GAAP financial metrics and reconciliations on our website. We will make forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and are only valid as of today. The company assumes no obligation to update them. Please review the company's recent SEC filings for a more complete picture of our risks and other factors. 
 And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ron. 
Ronald Nersesian: Thank you, Jason, and welcome, everyone. I will start by sharing 4 headlines regarding Keysight's Q1 results. First, revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, operating margin was at the high-end of our guidance, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.56. While this is our first time reporting quarterly results as an independent company, it is the fourth quarter in a row that we've delivered financial results above expectations. Second, we are further ahead on our stabilization plans than where we expect expected to be at this point. Third, we remain committed to creating shareholder value and to returning to market growth rates. We continue to focus intently on transforming our portfolio and receive several distinguished industry recognitions in Q1 for a modular PXI Vector Network Analyzer family that is a proof point of our ability to innovate beyond current market offerings. And fourth, now that we have one quarter of results under our belt as an independent company and we have validated our models, we are changing from guiding operating margin to guiding non-GAAP earnings per share. 
 Let's move to the specifics of our results. Keysight Q1 revenues of $701 million increased 4% year-over-year or 7% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions and were $6 million above the midpoint of our guidance. First quarter orders of $691 million decreased 1% year-over-year, or grew 1% on a core basis. Keysight achieved strong profit margins that were above our guidance generating operating profit of $120 million and an operating margin of 17.1% for the quarter and non-GAAP earnings of $0.56 per share. 
 Turning to our end market performance. Total aerospace/defense revenues increased 22% compared to Q1 of last year when aerospace/defense was down significantly due to delays in the U.S. budget approvals. This quarter, aerospace/defense revenues were driven by our strong backlog entering the quarter and spending from both U.S. direct government accounts and contractors continued with the current stable budget environment. Aerospace/defense continued to be strong in Asia with growth in China. In Europe, aerospace/defense revenues were soft due to general macro economic weakness and events in Russia, which we highlighted in prior quarters as potential risks to our outlook. 
 Industrial computers and semiconductor revenues decreased 6% year-over-year, largely due to the expected slowdown in semiconductor end markets after its very strong FY '14. We also saw some slowing in our industrial business after a strong Q4. Communications revenues grew 8% year-over-year in Q1, driven by both R&D and manufacturing with continued strength in infrastructure and the component supply chain for mobile devices. Wireless R&D business was steady in Q1, tracking with our expectation of stable investment levels. This overall growth was partially offset by continued weakness in smartphone, handset and tablet manufacturing test, which we highlighted previously. 
 Turning to regional performance. Keysight revenues grew year-over-year in the Americas and Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, with declines in Europe and Japan. Americas grew 16% year-over-year driven by strength in aerospace/defense. Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, grew 6% with growth driven primarily from aerospace/defense and communications. Europe was down 5% year-over-year or 1% on a core basis. Japan was weak across all end markets this quarter, declining 15% year-over-year or 5% on a core basis. 
 Our priorities continue to center on growing the business in order to create long-term shareholder value. We do this by focusing on higher growth opportunities in our markets, such as wireless communications, modular solutions and software, while leveraging the strength of our business model. As we've said in previous calls, this transformation will be a consistent multi-year effort, yet you can see the progress we are making in our new introduction in industry recognition. 
 For example, in Q1, Keysight's first modular PXI Vector Network Analyzer family won several prestigious industry awards, making it one of the most significant test and measurement products in 2014. Honors include: Product of the Year from Electronic Products Magazine; Top Products of 2014 from Microwave & RF Magazine; and Hot 100 Products of 2014 from Electronic Design Network or EDM. Keysight's modular products use state-of-the-art technology from our traditional box instrumentation to deliver unparalleled combination of measurement performance, speed, size and cost of test for customers. Also in Q1, we introduced new signal generators, signal analyzers and network analyzers that exceed the performance of products in any form factor.  
 While we have been the technology leader in hardware for 75 years, in Q1, Keysight was recognized with the 2014 global Frost & Sullivan award for market leadership in instrumentation software for capturing the highest market share in the global instrumentation software market. We appreciate the recognition, yet we have more work to do, and we'll continue to innovate to grow our software solutions from this strong foundation.
 As I mentioned, we're on track with the separation, and I'm encouraged with how far we have come in a short amount of time since launching Keysight. In Q1, we continued rebranding our hardware and software products, and we closed our books in Q1 in our new stable ERP environment. That gives you a look into our results in Q1.
 Now I'll turn it over to Neil to provide the detail of Keysight's financial results and the details on the guidance for the next quarter. 
Neil Dougherty: Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, Keysight is off to a strong start in its first quarter as a fully independent company. Before I get into the details of our results, please note that my comments will refer to non-GAAP figures. In addition, we are now reporting results, not only for Keysight in aggregate, but for our 2 operating segments: measurement solutions and customer support and services. The segmentation of our business remains consistent with our SEC reporting in both our Form 10 and our FY '14 10-K.
 Now turning to our results. First quarter revenues of $701 million were up 4% year-over-year, or 7% on a core basis, which excludes the impact of currency and acquisitions. The impact of acquisitions was immaterial, so currency accounted for the full 3 percentage point headwind versus Q1 of FY '14. Keysight invested in R&D at a rate of 13% of revenue in the first quarter, which was in line with Q1 of FY '14. Operating margin of 17.1% was down 50 basis points versus the same period last year as we began to see the impact of the separation related dissynergies. Both revenue and operating margin were above the midpoint of our guidance range. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we have delivered in line with or better than guidance, as we continued to demonstrate the strength and discipline of our operating model.
 Taking a closer look at revenues. The regional revenue breakdown was largely consistent with prior periods, with 38% of revenues coming from the Americas, 19% from Europe, 33% from Asia, excluding Japan, and 10% from Japan. On a constant-currency basis, regional revenue grew 16% in the Americas, declined 1% in Europe, declined 5% in Japan and grew 7% in the rest of Asia. Last quarter, we noted Russia as a potential risk factor, and in Q1, we did see a material slowing of our incoming order rate due to ongoing sanctions and the devaluation of the ruble. We don't expect this situation to improve in the immediate future and expect our business in this region to remain suppressed in Q2. 
 Moving to the income statement. I'll make a few comments about currency given the recent volatility in foreign exchange rates. While currency movements do impact the individual line items of our P&L, they typically have a minimal impact on our operating margin as a result of our geographic diversification and systematic hedging program. Even though approximately 75% of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, currency fluctuations did have the 3 percentage point unfavorable impact on Q1 revenue growth that I noted earlier. That impact, however, was almost fully offset by the favorable impact of currency movements on cost and expenses. The result was that exchange rate fluctuations had no material net impact on our Q1 operating profit. After applying our 17% non-GAAP tax rate, Keysight generated non-GAAP net income of $96 million or $0.56 per share in our fiscal first quarter. 
 Now turning to cash flow. In Q1, Keysight generated cash from operations of $92 million, invested $15 million in capital expenditures resulting in $77 million of free cash flow. We finished the quarter in a net debt position of $211 million.
 Now let's move to the results for our 2 operating segments. Starting with our measurement solutions segment, which as a reminder, includes all of our hardware and software product solutions. In Q1, measurement solutions generated revenues of $606 million with an operating margin of 17.7%. Segment revenues grew 8% on a core basis, while operating margins improved 50 basis points year-over-year. Our second segment is customer support and services, which includes our repair, calibration and used equipment businesses. The customer support and services segment generated revenues of $95 million, which were flat on a core basis. However, after adjusting for the impact of the March 2013 change to our standard warranty period from 1 year to 3 years, segment revenues increased 8%. 
 First quarter operating margins for the customer support and services segment were 13.7%, a decline of 630 basis points year-over-year. There were 2 main factors driving this decline in segment profitability: first, shared infrastructure cost shifted in Q1 from measurement solutions to customer support and services based on the use of historic drivers. Second, we've made incremental investments in technology and capacity to drive services growth through a more complete product offering for large aerospace and defense customers.
 Now turning to our guidance for the second quarter of FY '15, which assumes exchange rates as of January 31. We expect Q2 revenues to be in the range of $720 million to $760 million, which, after accounting for currency, reflects 3% core year-over-year revenue growth at the midpoint. The slowdown in Russia is factored into our guidance and provides an additional 1 to 2 percentage point headwind to growth. Despite these top line impacts, we expect second quarter EPS to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.70. Our EPS projection assumes no material earnings impact from currency and a share count of 171 million shares. 
 We remain confident in the strength of our operating model and maintain the same discipline that we have exercised over the past several years. With this discipline, we expect to deliver operating margins in the mid-teens in the troughs and better than 20% at the peaks, while making the investments necessary to drive growth for Keysight. 
 With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A. 
Jason Kary: Thank you, Neil. Operator, will you please give the instructions for the Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from Patrick Newton from Stifel. 
Patrick Newton: I guess the first one is just on the market growth rate. I think, last quarter, you cited an expectation of about 2.5% to 3.5% growth for the market and the expectation that Keysight would grow slightly below that rate. Is that still -- has that changed at all, due to the FX impacts? Or is that still a realistic market growth rate? 
Ronald Nersesian: When you look at the core growth rate, Patrick, I think, the core growth rate is right, as far as the FX impact, there's no doubt that currency is affecting the growth rates of our business and other players' business going forward. But the good news is, for Keysight, we're hedged, so it doesn't affect our bottom line. You'll see our operating margin percentage creep up because unless revenue due to FX will generate the same profitability and generate a little bit higher operating margin such as why we were at 17.1% this last quarter. 
Patrick Newton: Okay. And then I guess you made comments about transforming the business and making investments to drive growth. Can you help us understand how we should think about that from an organic basis? And maybe where R&D trends should go on a go-forward basis? And then, from an inorganic basis, can you help us understand what your M&A strategy is? Is there any type of, I guess, size that you're willing to, I guess, consummate at this time? Any type of leverage ratios we should look at or target multiples? Just anything to help us gauge how we should think about your M&A appetite on a go-forward basis. 
Ronald Nersesian: Unfortunately, at this point, because of the limited number of prospects that exist in the competitive environment, we're not commenting on what we plan to do in M&A. I will tell you though that our focus, which is all around improving our wireless communications portfolio, improving our modular offering and improving our software capability and extracting above-market growth rates from those 3 areas, would be the areas that are very important to us. Those are the main areas, but we will also look at other opportunities that seem to make sense. As far as leverage ratio, I'll let Neil answer that. 
Neil Dougherty: Yes, so one of the things that we've stated is that we do value our investment-grade credit rating. And as a result of that, I think we will look to manage leverage in or around the 2x EBITDA level. The other question that you asked as part of that was, what we would expect with regard to R&D investment to drive organic growth. And as we've stated in the past, we're going to look to increase R&D this year to 13% of revenue. We spent the 13% of revenue in the first quarter on, albeit a seasonally low revenue quarter, but you'll see the absolute dollar R&D spend ramp throughout the year, and we should look to spend very close to that 13% for the full year of FY '15. 
Patrick Newton: Okay. And I guess, just one last clarification question, Ron, and kind of in answering where you want to see growth, you specifically brought up communications, and that's an area whether, from new products, it sounds like a lot of interesting new product announcements out there. You did have a private competitor that in their kind of annual filing said that the saturation effects are becoming evident in production test and measurement for the wireless communications industry. I'm curious if you're seeing any saturation effects? Or you sound like communications is going to be part of the growth drivers. Are you gaining share? Or what is kind of driving the -- maybe the difference of opinions between competitors? 
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. We see the same thing that you see with the same private competitor, and we've noted that and noted that over the last year or almost 2. Fortunately, it's in one sector of the communication area, and that's in the production and test environment. So one of our long-term strategies that we've been talking for years is to move more and more of our portfolio from production test into R&D. The manufacturing environment or production environment is one in which there are more and more competitors, the barriers to entry are lower because the performance needs are lower, and it's all about cost and we've seen some competitive moves that are all just about price. So we continue to focus more and more of our investment in research, in development. And as of now, I'm happy to report that slightly over half of our total business is in R&D. Where, in the past, manufacturing was a bigger percentage for us. But that's a concerted strategy that we have to invest where there is still good opportunities to extract value and produce good returns. And we see that much more in R&D than we do in production. We are opportunistic in certain areas in production, but our primary focus is in R&D. 
Operator: Next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. 
Sachin Kulkarni: This is Sachin in for Brandon. Ron, in the communications business, I know this may be a bit early. But when do you think we will start to see the next 5G cycle begin to impact demand in the wireless R&D arena? And do you view 5G as a possible fiscal year '16 opportunity or further out? 
Ronald Nersesian: We're starting to see -- right now, we see some very small investments, we're partnering with different players to go ahead and help develop the technology and we're working with folks like China Mobile to move that forward. But you will not see the volume for a period of time. I'm going to let Guy give a little bit of color commentary, but as he will explain to you, it's going to be a while before that really ramps in the P&L. 
Guy Séné: If I can add what -- some more colors on this. Clearly, 5G will not be deployed, at the earliest, before 2020. That's really the goal. And between now and then, obviously, there's a lot of research that is going to happen, and we are part of multiple consortium across the world who also have direct contacts and relationships with market makers. We have announced a memorandum of understanding with China Mobile to work with them on developing the technology. But it's very, very early phases. We're taking some orders currently. We have taken deals with research institutes that do some early research for some of this technology that need to happen. But I would not envision big shifts before at least 2 more years. 
Sachin Kulkarni: Got it. And also, Ron, would you give us an update on the traction you're seeing from new products, particularly in modular, EXM and UXM? 
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. At this point, what typically happens on the UXM side, in particular, is people will buy those products and they'll buy them for R&D. And they'll buy one, and they'll see how they like it and then they'll start to populate that around the lab. We've seen some good traction in that area, although it's certainly a multi-year rollout, or an effort of ramping. We also add new software capability along the line, but I'll let Guy talk about both of them. 
Guy Séné: Yes, since we introduced this product about 9 months ago, we're definitely shipping them in volume now. For the manufacturing more focus product that is the EXM, we have now been qualified by all the major chipset vendors and manufacturers, and this is a major milestone that we had in our plan to go. And then on the R&D side, we're making very good progress, especially in China where there's a number of investments going, and we keep adding differentiated features and performance on this platform, especially oriented versus the LTE advanced solutions that people will look at more and more. In fact, more of this will be most likely seen at the Mobile World Congress that is this major event for the mobile industry that will happen in a couple of weeks, and we will have a number of our products there. 
Operator: Next question is from Richard Eastman from Robert W. Baird. 
Richard Eastman: Ron, could you just speak to a minute to the kind of the general purpose in industrial computer semi piece of the business being down 6%. I think the semi was recognized to have had a really tough comp. But year-over-year, did the industrial and computer pieces of that grow were they up in the quarter year-over-year? 
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. Overall, we don't break it down by each one of the subsegments. In industrial, it was roughly flat on a core basis. There was a little bit of currency headwinds, but on a core basis, we were roughly flat on the industrial side. And the computer and semi business, which we report together, was down. But again, that was driven by really the semiconductor market, which had a spectacular year last year and delivered some great growth for us. 
Richard Eastman: And when you look at the by end of market, when you look at the industrial computer semi, the aerospace/defense and com, it strikes me, were these growth rates kind of at plan? Or did we see a little better performance on the A&D side and maybe a little softer on the industrial computer semi? Or -- could you just parse that out a little bit? 
Ronald Nersesian: Sure. Overall, there were no big surprises. Last year, in Q1, we were surprised that the aerospace/defense budget dollars were not passed out as quickly as the end-users and the government told us that they will be placing orders, and they were very frustrated to actually place the -- not get the money to place the orders, so we had a relatively low compare. So we expected that to bounce back. There was nothing that was significantly off from what we'd expected and what we were expecting to happen. The biggest thing is that Russia, we had expected Russia to decline, I had talked about that a couple of quarters ago. It held up a little bit longer than we thought. But now, we're seeing 2 effects: one, we're seeing clearly the fact of the FX or the currency lowering the amount of revenue that we get in U.S. dollars because they -- folks do not have enough buying power. So the bottom line is they can't buy the equipment that they want to buy because the ruble has depreciated so much. And that's probably the, I'd say, the strongest point is that Russia has finally contracted like we thought it would have a couple of quarters ago. 
Richard Eastman: And just a -- and as a follow-up, the customer support and services business. Should we be thinking about the up margin kind of stabilizing more in this mid-teens, 14% range? And is there anything on the used equipment side of the business that's captured in this customer support services that gives you any feel one way or the other for strength of end market demand? 
Neil Dougherty: I'll take the first part of that question, with regard to the profit margins in CSS. Actually, I think you should not think about this business stabilizing at this new lower profit level. We have a few things -- we did make this -- fix this investment in technology, in capacity to service customers in the aerospace business. Those investments had to be made in advance of the recognition of that revenue. And then as I did say, based on the use of historic drivers to essentially split what is a pretty significant shared infrastructure cost, we did see some expenses move from the much larger measurement solutions business, you don't really -- it's almost unnoticeable at that segment level, but at a business that's less than $100 million in quarterly revenue, you move the dollars over and has a material impact on profitability. So we will reevaluate those drivers to make sure that they're appropriate for those businesses going forward. I don't have an opinion on that yet, and I'll reserve judgment. But we'll take a look at those and make sure that we've got an appropriate driver to split our shared infrastructure costs. 
Richard Eastman: Okay. But it's not a structural issue within this segment, so to speak? I mean it's more around the allocation, and obviously, I understand IT investment, that makes sense. But there's nothing structurally that says this business should be 5, 6 points operating profit lower. 
Ronald Nersesian: Absolutely not. There's no doubt. For instance, we were very happy that we won some nice big contracts, multi-year contracts to basically provide calibration -- on-site calibration services for multiple vendors from some larger aerospace events players. The key thing is we have to ramp up and put some expenses in place to put our folks in. But we expect our profitability in this segment to be back up once that -- once we start receiving the revenue that corresponds with that and once we adjust the drivers properly. But we see the service, the whole service sector, to do 2 things for us: One, it's a good growth opportunity for us in the future; and two, it will be solidly profitable in the upper teens to 20% range. And three, it will be much more stable over time. So it will provide more of a recurring revenue base for us. As you see, in installed base of equipment, if our $3 billion a year worth of equipment lasts 10 years on average and many pieces of our equipment are out for 20 years, that's $30 billion worth of equipment that's out there that needs to be calibrated and repaired on an ongoing basis. So I really am enthused about the ability to move to more of an annuity model that brings in very solid profitability and helps derisk in the volatility that we have. 
Richard Eastman: And is it -- can you make any inferences from the marketplace itself on your used equipment sales? If the demand is better, meaning demand picks up and that should translate into new equipment at some point? Or is there anything to be seen there and is there any change of any consequence? 
Ronald Nersesian: I would just say that our used equipment inventory is low. So that implies that we do not have much equipment in that area and that it's been pulled out. I wouldn't call any dramatic shifts at this point but our used equipment is -- inventory is lower-than-average, due to the sales of that over the last year. 
Operator: And the question comes from the line of Jim Covello with Goldman Sachs. 
James Covello: In the communication segment, the strength you referenced in the components supply chain for mobile devices, how seasonal versus cyclical do you think that is? And then how do you feel about the quarter-to-quarter share shifts amongst you and your competitors in that segment? 
Ronald Nersesian: Yes, Jim. Deal by deal that obviously, when you're talking about some of the bigger deals, you'll see the share jump around. But we have been very, very, very solid on the component side. So a lot of times, over the past years, everybody's been talking about winning final production test, and talking about that as far as winning major manufacturers. We have stated for years that we really see that our opportunity to create value is further upstream. What we do first with EDA design software, what we do for component test, what we do for validation way before it even gets into production. We're holding our own and doing very nicely. We came out with some new products that Guy has just talked about, that are getting traction. But you see network analyzers that are a big part of that, and we are #1, and we have more -- we sell more network analyzers than everybody else in the world put together. So we feel very good about our share in that area. As far as the cyclicality on the component test, it really is more on when phones are produced. So as you know, there is a component -- that there's a seasonal component to that, but as we see people with the capacity moving up and down, we see different types of purchases. One of the things that you also see on our website or you'll see in a press release from 2 days ago, we introduced a brand-new family of ENAs, which are Economy Network Analyzers that are exceptional for component test, and you'll see roughly 5 or 6 brand-new products that were introduced that are very, very powerful in this space. So not only do we have over 50% share, we just took our game up to a whole -- a whole another level. 
Operator: That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jason Kary, for any final comments.
